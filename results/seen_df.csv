12508,"The Pacific coast of Colombia has witnessed several tsunami events in the last century. However, the physical damage to structures at the time was not recorded, even when these events have brought overwhelming destruction to coastal communities. This lack of data increases uncertainties when assessing future tsunami impacts. Nonetheless, other regions of the world, which have been also affected by tsunami, have collected damage information that has been used to build empirical tsunami fragility functions. Based on a demand parameter, such as the tsunami inundation depth, a fragility function expresses the probability of building damage. Hence, regions with no recent tsunami damage cannot develop empirical fragility functions since post-disaster damage survey data is not available. One alternative for these regions is to develop analytical fragility functions out of computational nonlinear structural analysis. Reinforced concrete buildings and palafitte houses are selected to perform a comparative analysis of collapse damage assessment expressed in empirical and analytical fragility functions. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

12510,"A fragility function shows the building damage likelihood based on a demand parameter such as the tsunami flow depth. While empirical fragility functions have been developed by using postdisaster damage survey data, regions with no recent tsunami damage cannot develop these estimations. Alternatively, analytical fragility functions could be developed to fill this gap. Along the Colombian Pacific coast, several tsunami events have occurred; however, the aftermath resulting from the structure physical damage was not recorded. Fortunately, other regions of the have collected tsunami damage information, which has been analyzed and represented in terms of empirical fragility functions. This paper provides a comparative study of empirical and analytical tsunami fragility functions. It is focused on the analytical fragility functions developed for typical structures in Tumaco, Colombia and on empirical fragility curves taken from damage survey data of recent tsunami events. The differences in the assessments of the damage produced by the two methods in the case of a two-story reinforced concrete building in Tumaco is discussed herein. As a result of the comparison, it was shown that the structures in Tumaco have higher collapse probabilities at lower flow depths than structures in other places along the Pacific and Indian Oceans. © 2020 Japan Society of Civil Engineers.","A comparative study of empirical and analytical fragility functions for the assessment of tsunami building damage in Tumaco, Colombia",2020,analytical fragility curves  empirical fragility curves  nonlinear structural analysis  Tsunami damage,Concrete buildings  Reinforced concrete  Surveys  Tsunamis  Collapse probabilities  Comparative studies  Fragility curves  Fragility function  Nonlinear structural analysis  Physical damages  Tsunami damages  Typical structures  Damage detection,1,1
12512,"In the last decade, probabilistic approaches for flood risk assessment have emerged, often as an extension of more consolidated methods used in probabilistic seismic risk assessment. Nonetheless, only a few studies deal with best-practice methodologies for flood vulnerability assessment and existing approaches lack of an appropriate guidance for their selection. These concerns underline the need for a rational, integrated and complete compendium of all the existing flood-related vulnerability and fragility relationships to be used in a comprehensive probabilistic flood risk assessment framework. Following the same approach used in the guidelines recently developed by the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) Project, this paper presents a preliminary review of the state-of-art regarding existing empirical vulnerability and fragility curves in the context of flood risk. In particular, a worldwide overview is intended in terms of data sources, assets features and also statistical techniques employed for data collection and fitting. The research aims at providing a complete and flexible guide for selection of vulnerability and fragility curves for building structures. A discussion on data sources, building classification and considered features, and damage scales is presented, in order to evaluate the reliability, and at the same time the limitations, of different approaches and provide recommendation for future studies.",A compendium of existing vulnerability and fragility relationships for flood: Preliminary results,2015,None,Classification (of information)  Risk assessment  Building structure  Earthquake modeling  Flood risk assessments  Flood vulnerabilities  Fragility curves  Probabilistic approaches  Probabilistic seismic risk assessments  Statistical techniques  Floods,1,1
12518,"Compound natural hazards likeEl Ninoevents cause high damage to society, which to manage requires reliable risk assessments. Damage modelling is a prerequisite for quantitative risk estimations, yet many procedures still rely on expert knowledge, and empirical studies investigating damage from compound natural hazards hardly exist. A nationwide building survey in Peru after theEl Ninoevent 2017 - which caused intense rainfall, ponding water, flash floods and landslides - enables us to apply data-mining methods for statistical groundwork, using explanatory features generated from remote sensing products and open data. We separate regions of different dominant characteristics through unsupervised clustering, and investigate feature importance rankings for classifying damage via supervised machine learning. Besides the expected effect of precipitation, the classification algorithms select the topographic wetness index as most important feature, especially in low elevation areas. The slope length and steepness factor ranks high for mountains and canyons. Partial dependence plots further hint at amplified vulnerability in rural areas.

12523,"The current research is targeted to develop the analytical fragility relationships of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings in high-intensity seismic zones by considering the effects of higher structural modes to reduce the computational effort. A new framework is presented in the study to assess the vulnerability in terms of the fragility relationships that can consider the modal response of individual modes in a building structure. The developed methodology considers the uncoupled modes of a structure employing a nonlinear single degree of freedom structures and defines distinct limit states for each mode separately. By using the presented methodology, the response of higher modes can be incorporated in the fragility assessment. For elucidation, a two-story reinforced concrete (RC) school building structure is selected from seismic zone 4 of Pakistan. In the first place, its vulnerability is assessed by developing fragility relationships using dynamic response history analysis of full three Dimensional nonlinear analytical models, subsequently, the fragility relationships are developed using the presented methodology by considering the first two modes of the structure. Afterward, a comparison has been made between the developed fragility curves from both of the methodologies. The results prove the effectiveness, swiftness, and the simplicity of the established methodology for carrying out the vulnerability assessments without compromising any accuracy.

12525,"A fragility curve is a function that expresses the probability of failure of a structure or component as a function of the intensity of external aggression. This paper proposes a general framework for the development of analytical fragility functions from data based on the copula approach. Such a model allows for any kinds of marginal distributions and dependence structures so that it can be applied to various types of fragility data, analytical or empirical. The fragility function is then derived from the joint distribution of intensity and damage measures. The Bayesian information criterion is used to select the most plausible model among the candidate joint distributions, given the data. The practical implementation of the methodology is illustrated by an analytical test case and by the evaluation of seismic fragility curves for a reinforced concrete building. Several candidate marginal distributions, in agreement with the nature and the physical properties of the variables (e.g. common intensity and damage measures take only positive values) are evaluated. In particular, seismic intensity measures are lognormal random variables according to seismological models. This paper is focused on bivariate distributions but the case of vector valued intensity measures can be treated accordingly. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",A general framework for the estimation of analytical fragility functions based on multivariate probability distributions,2017,Conditional probability  Copula  Fragility curve  Performance based earthquake engineering  Time history analysis,Concrete buildings  Damage detection  Earthquake engineering  Highway bridges  Probability  Reinforced concrete  Seismology  Conditional probabilities  Copula  Fragility curves  Performance-based earthquake engineering  Time history analysis  Probability distributions,1,1
12526,"The use of different methods for physical flood vulnerability assessment has evolved over time, from traditional single-parameter stage-damage curves to multi-parameter approaches such as multivariate or indicator-based models. However, despite the extensive implementation of these models in flood risk assessment globally, a considerable gap remains in their applicability to data-scarce regions. Considering that these regions are mostly areas with a limited capacity to cope with disasters, there is an essential need for assessing the physical vulnerability of the built environment and contributing to an improvement of flood risk reduction. To close this gap, we propose linking approaches with reduced data requirements, such as vulnerability indicators (integrating major damage drivers) and damage grades (integrating frequently observed damage patterns). First, we present a review of current studies of physical vulnerability indicators and flood damage models comprised of stage-damage curves and the multivariate methods that have been applied to predict damage grades. Second, we propose a new conceptual framework for assessing the physical vulnerability of buildings exposed to flood hazards that has been specifically tailored for use in data-scarce regions. This framework is operationalized in three steps: (i) developing a vulnerability index, (ii) identifying regional damage grades, and (iii) linking resulting index classes with damage patterns, utilizing a synthetic ""what-if""analysis. The new framework is a first step for enhancing flood damage prediction to support risk reduction in data-scarce regions. It addresses selected gaps in the literature by extending the application of the vulnerability index for damage grade prediction through the use of a synthetic multi-parameter approach. The framework can be adapted to different data-scarce regions and allows for integrating possible modifications to damage drivers and damage grades. © 2020 Author(s).",A generic physical vulnerability model for floods: Review and concept for data-scarce regions,2020,None,conceptual framework  data set  disaster management  flood  flood damage  multivariate analysis  risk assessment  vulnerability,1,1
12528,"“Earthquake’s do kill the people.” It is a clear misconception. Earthquakes never kill, but it is always the constructional failure which makes the situation worse and leads to the loss of life. Earthquake’s root to a huge economic loss apart from the tortuous pain of loss of lives. This calls for the need of seismic strengthening as the circumgyrations are inevitable. Seismic strengthening improves the structural safety but does not reduce the seismic response. Seismic strengthening is a pre-disaster assessment. But the need to study the observance of the existing buildings against the circumgyrations lead to a stew of post-disaster mitigation with pre-disaster planning known as Fragility analysis. Fragility analysis refers to the partial assessment of vulnerability of the buildings subjected to earthquake motions. In this study, the fragility curves are developed with the aid of Incremental dynamic analysis or Nonlinear dynamic analysis conducted on the model. The curves explain the conditional anticipation which outstrip adefinite limit of failure and therefore guesstimate the susceptibility of the structure. Fragility curves are very much useful in seismic loss estimation studies in earth quake prone zones. Two structural models four storey & six storey 3D open frame buildings were considered.The structural models are designed for dead, live and seismic loads according to the Indian Code. A set of 5 Farfield ground motions scaled from 0.1 to 1 with an increment of 0.1 are used in the Incremental dynamic analysis using SAAP2000. Four performance levels, namely Fully Operational (FO), Immediate Occupancy (IO), Life Safety (LS) and Collapse Prevention (CP) were considered and monitored in the analysis using MATLAB. The objective of the study is to develop the fragility curves for a low rise (G+3) and medium rise (G+5) building models using the Graphical User Interface (GUI) in MATLABR2016a considering the four selected performance levels.

12532,"The 2017 Puebla, Mexico, earthquake event led to significant damage in many buildings in Mexico City. In the months following the earthquake, civil engineering students conducted detailed building assessments throughout the city. They collected building damage information and structural characteristics for 340 buildings in the Mexico City urban area, with an emphasis on the Roma and Condesa neighborhoods where they assessed 237 buildings. These neighborhoods are of particular interest due to the availability of seismic records captured by nearby recording stations, and preexisting information from when the neighborhoods were affected by the 1985 Michoacán earthquake. This article presents a case study on developing a damage prediction model using machine learning. It details a framework suitable for working with future post-earthquake observation data. Four algorithms able to perform classification tasks were trialed. Random forest, the best performing algorithm, achieves more than 65% prediction accuracy. The study of the feature importance for the random forest shows that the building location, seismic demand, and building height are the parameters that influence the model output the most. © The Author(s) 2020.","A machine learning damage prediction model for the 2017 Puebla-Morelos, Mexico, earthquake",2020,2017 Puebla Mexico earthquake  damage assessment  damage prediction  machine learning  seismic building damage,Buildings  Damage detection  Decision trees  Earthquakes  Machine learning  Predictive analytics  Random forests  Building assessment  Civil engineering students  Classification tasks  Damage prediction models  Earthquake observations  Prediction accuracy  Recording stations  Structural characteristics  Forecasting  algorithm  building  earthquake damage  machine learning  numerical model  prediction  seismic response  Mexico [North America]  Morelos  Puebla [Mexico],1,1
12534,"The study of the seismic vulnerability of Reinforced Concrete (RC) buildings is a topic of large interest for the scientific community and public institutions, who have the task of providing mitigation strategies for the seismic risk for a wide and inhomogeneous portfolio of buildings with very limited economic resources. With this regard, within the research project ReLUIS 2014-2018, typological and structural information about recurrent classes of RC buildings was collected in some municipalities of Puglia, Italy. Based on these data, it has been possible to identify some representative “Index” buildings, characterized by common morphological, mechanical and geometrical features and identified by a set of relevant characteristic parameters having a defined variation within a plausible range. In this paper, based on the available dataset of building information in some municipalities and on the results of seismic vulnerability analyses about residential RC building typologies, the fragility of representative Index buildings has been investigated. In particular, by using the data collected from a previous large-scale investigation performed in the Municipality of Bovino, preliminary regional fragility curves have been derived for of the index buildings previously defined. The significant mechanical parameters have been varied within pre-defined ranges; for each obtained “sample” simulated design has been made deriving the computational model; at last, the assessment has been performed through the development of a pushover-based procedure. The variation of the parameters and their combination have been carried out in order to appraise their influence in the regional seismic fragility. Copyright © 2019 COMPDYN Proceedings.

12536,"The development of accurate seismic fragility curves is a key to effective seismic risk management. This study proposes a new hybrid method to derive the seismic fragility curves of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings. In the first step, nonlinear time-history analyses are conducted to analyze the inter-story drift (ISD) ratios. Based on the analysis results, analytical fragility curves are derived for three damage states of light, moderate, and severe with varying levels of peak ground acceleration (PGA). Subsequently, empirical damage data of RC buildings collected for an actual earthquake is converted to ISD ratios using empirical equations. Lastly, based on the empirical damage data, hybrid fragility curves are derived by updating the median of the ISD ratios for a reference PGA level using Bayesian updating. In addition, to update the median values at other PGA levels including no empirical data, a new scaling factor, which is the ratio of the posterior and prior median values at the reference PGA level, is proposed. To test the proposed method, it is applied to RC buildings in Pohang city, South Korea, which were subjected to a magnitude-5.4 earthquake in 2017. From the comparison of analytical fragility curves with hybrid fragility curves, it is observed that the analytical curves overestimate the seismic vulnerability of the RC buildings, and the proposed method provides hybrid fragility curves successfully. © 2019 European Safety and Reliability Association.

12545,"The intensity and/or frequency of hurricane storms may change due to the impact of potential climate change. This paper presents a probabilistic framework to assess the hurricane damage to residential constructions considering the non-stationarity and correlation in hurricane actions. The framework includes a non-stationary Poisson process of hurricane occurrence, a failure rate function of hurricane damage, and explicit formulas for evaluating the mean and variance of annual hurricane damage. The framework is illustrated using a case study of Miami-Dade County, Florida, where the current probabilistic models of hurricane intensity and occurrence rate were estimated by examining hurricane history in this area. The impacts of time-variant hurricane intensity and time-variant hurricane frequency on building damage are assessed individually using the developed framework.

12549,"Risk-based approaches have been increasingly accepted and operationalized in flood risk management during recent decades. For instance, commercial flood risk models are used by the insurance industry to assess potential losses, establish the pricing of policies and determine reinsurance needs. Despite considerable progress in the development of loss estimation tools since the 1980s, loss estimates still reflect high uncertainties and disparities that often lead to questioning their quality. This requires an assessment of the validity and robustness of loss models as it affects prioritization and investment decision in flood risk management as well as regulatory requirements and business decisions in the insurance industry. Hence, more effort is needed to quantify uncertainties and undertake validations. Due to a lack of detailed and reliable flood loss data, first order validations are difficult to accomplish, so that model comparisons in terms of benchmarking are essential. It is checked if the models are informed by existing data and knowledge and if the assumptions made in the models are aligned with the existing knowledge. When this alignment is confirmed through validation or benchmarking exercises, the user gains confidence in the models. Before these benchmarking exercises are feasible, however, a cohesive survey of existing knowledge needs to be undertaken. With that aim, this work presents a review of flood loss-or flood vulnerability-relationships collected from the public domain and some professional sources. Our survey analyses 61 sources consisting of publications or software packages, of which 47 are reviewed in detail. This exercise results in probably the most complete review of flood loss models to date containing nearly a thousand vulnerability functions. These functions are highly heterogeneous and only about half of the loss models are found to be accompanied by explicit validation at the time of their proposal. This paper exemplarily presents an approach for a quantitative comparison of disparate models via the reduction to the joint input variables of all models. Harmonization of models for benchmarking and comparison requires profound insight into the model structures, mechanisms and underlying assumptions.

12554,"Ground motion records are generally required to develop fragility curves which are utilized in seismic loss estimation studies for earthquake prone zones. These records could be 'real', i.e. recorded acceleration time series or 'simulated' records consistent with the regional seismicity and produced using alternative simulation techniques. This study mainly concentrates on development of fragility curves for masonry buildings located in Erzincan (eastern Turkey) using 'simulated' ground motion records and evaluates the suitability of these fragilities by comparing with the curves developed utilizing 'real' records. To generate a set of scenario earthquakes by using regional seismicity parameters of Erzincan, stochastic finite-fault methodology has been employed as the simulation technique. The 'real' records, on the other hand, are selected from Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center's NGA-West2 ground motion database and chosen to be compatible with the seismological characteristics of the region of interest. The records are imposed on a set of masonry buildings (with 1-, 2-, 3-stories and 3 different quality classes) representing the building stock in Erzincan. To assess the dynamic responses of the structures, nonlinear time history analyses utilizing equivalent single-degree-of-freedom systems are performed on OpenSees platform. Afterwards, fragility curves for three limit states (Immediate Occupancy, Life Safety and Collapse Prevention) are generated.

12572,"The incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) is a powerful methodology that can be easily extended for calculating probabilistic seismic damage curves. These curves are metadata to assess the seismic risk of structures. Although this methodology requires a relevant computational effort, it should be the reference to correctly estimate the seismic risk of structures. Nevertheless, it would be of high practical interest to have a simpler methodology, based for instance on the pushover analysis (PA), to obtain similar results to those based on IDA. In this article, PA is used to obtain probabilistic seismic damage curves from the stiffness degradation and the energy of the nonlinear part of the capacity curve. A fully probabilistic methodology is tackled by means of Monte Carlo simulations with the purpose of establishing that the results based on the simplified proposed approach are compatible with those obtained with the IDA. Comparisons between the results of both approaches are included for a low- to midrise reinforced concrete building.

12574,"The tornado risk assessment methodology currently used by both private and public agencies utilizes empirically derived loss models that rely on historical claims data for predicting future effects of tornadoes. The accuracy of these empirical models is dependent on many factors, including the quality and quantity of available historical data, accuracy of the tornado intensity models, and the universality of applying those empirical models from one region to another. A more rigorous approach may be the development of engineering-based damage assessment models, made applicable to construction in any region and to any tornado that varies in size and strength. This chapter presents a framework for an engineering-based tornado damage assessment (ETDA) for low-rise buildings. The model predicts damage on the most vulnerable sector of the built environment, nonengineered residential buildings. The model components include a translating tornado vortex model, a tornado-induced wind load calculation approach, a probabilistic wind-borne debris impact model, and a time-variant model for internal pressure changes within the structure. The time evolution of structural damage to a building is determined using successive time steps of component level wind loading vs. structural resistance as the tornado translates past the building. The output of this model is a percentage damage index for each component and the overall building damage ratio. The ETDA model is illustrated using four houses damaged in the 2011 Joplin, MO, tornado. Predicted damage using the ETDA model is in good agreement (within 15?%) of post-tornado damage observations reported by the third author. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",An engineering-based approach to predict Tornado-induced damage,2016,None,Buildings  Risk assessment  Structural analysis  Tornadoes  Damage assessment models  Low-rise buildings  Residential building  Risk assessment methodologies  Structural damages  Structural resistance  Tornado intensity  Tornado-induced wind loads  Damage detection,1,1

12591,"Hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones (hereafter referred to as ""hurricanes"") continue to have a significant impact on residential developments around the world. As more populations continue to migrate into the path of these costly natural hazards, it is becoming increasingly important to develop new methods to quantify damage to residential developments in order to increase the resilience of communities. One way to increase community resilience from a structural engineering standpoint is to limit the damage incurred by a residential development subjected to a hurricane wind event. Previous post-hurricane damage assessments have illustrated the integrity of the building envelope plays a key role in reducing or even eliminating the significant losses typically associated with hurricane wind hazards. In order to assess the post-hurricane state of a residential development, three failure modes common to residential building envelopes are implemented using the axioms of probability to implement an analytical damage quantification method. Results illustrating the implementation of the proposed method will be presented using a probabilistic building envelope failure assessment model applied to a residential development subjected to ten synthetic hurricane events each with a maximum mean wind speed equivalent to a 700-year return period wind speed. Benefits are twofold, as this research provides (1) a useful tool for assessing the state of physical residential developments with information readily available after post-hurricane damage assessments, and (2) the ability to determine the temporal status of a residential development during the recovery process, which is crucial to implement community life-cycle resilience assessments.",Analytical damage quantification method for residential developments subjected to hurricane wind hazards,2015,None,Hazards  Housing  Hurricanes  Probability  Safety engineering  Solar buildings  Storms  Wind  Wind effects  Building envelopes  Community resiliences  Damage quantification  Failure assessment  Hurricane damage  Recovery process  Residential building  Residential development  Damage detection,1,1
12592,"M. Djamil Hospital is the largest public medical facility in Padang area with over 800 patient beds. The magnitude 7.6 Western Sumatra earthquake of September 30, 2009 caused the first floor of one housing outpatient services collapsed. Padang city is located in West Sumatra province which is recorded as an earthquake and tsunami prone area in Indonesia. Risk reduction strategy can be implemented by assessing the vulnerability of building through fragility curve. In this study, the fragility curve was carried out to an existing Maternity and Childrens's M. Djamil Hospital building due to earthquake and tsunami in sequence. Building's structural was modelled in ETABS v. 17 and analyzed by using Pushover analysis and Nonlinear Time History analysis. This structural model was subjected through a total of 40 ground motion data from El Centro, Northridge, Kobe and Padang. Each ground motion data was normalized from 0.2g to 2.0g of peak ground acceleration and continued with tsunami load. Analysis results consist of drift at yield point and structure maximum drift, which are then generated into a fragility curve based on Hazus standard. The result of earthquake fragility curve represents that the probability of slight damage level is 100%, moderate 100%, extensive 92% and collapse 5.4%.

12595,"The prediction of damages caused by a tsunami over a large coastal area is a complex problem. One of the issues is the evaluation of the structural damage to buildings and infrastructures. A tsunami is preceded by a ground motion, both are caused by an earthquake. The coastal structures are hit, within a short period of time by both phenomena. In this study, we developed a method to build fragility curves for reinforced concrete structures subject to tsunami.

12599,"Harbours are crucial assets for the sustainment and development of human activities. The recent devastating tsunami events as well as the increasing number of people, structures and economic activities being exposed to tsunami hazards revealed the need for the estimation of the effects of tsunami wave on seaport structures. However, only a limited number of tools to estimate the potential impacts of tsunami are available until now. This study aims at developing analytical tsunami fragility functions for some representative typologies of seaport structures in Greece. In particular, low-code moment resisting frame (MRF) and dual reinforced concrete (RC) buildings of various heights, and a typical warehouse are considered in the analysis. A numerical investigation is performed considering different combinations of tsunami loads based on FEMA P646 (2008) [1] recommendations for gradually increasing tsunami inundation depths and for the various structure typologies. To minimize the uncertainties related to the definition of damage limit states, tsunami nonlinear static analyses are performed and appropriate tsunami capacity curves are derived for the considered structures. Structural limit states are defined on tsunami capacity curves in terms of threshold values of material strain. For the complete damage state, shear failure is also considered, since the collapse of structures may be caused by the occurrence of either a flexural or shear failure in structural components. Fragility curves are numerically calculated for the different damage states using nonlinear regression analysis. They could be used within a probabilistic risk assessment framework to assess the vulnerability of low-code RC buildings and typical warehouses exposed to tsunami hazard along European-Mediterranean and other regions of similar facilities worldwide. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Analytical tsunami fragility curves for seaport RC buildings and steel light frame warehouses,2018,Inundation depth  RC buildings  Shear failure  Steel light frame warehouses  Structural damage states  Tsunami capacity curves  Tsunami fragility curves,Concrete buildings  Economics  Floods  Hazards  Ports and harbors  Regression analysis  Reinforced concrete  Risk assessment  Static analysis  Structural analysis  Structural frames  Uncertainty analysis  Warehouses  Capacity curves  Fragility curves  Inundation depth  Light frames  RC buildings  Shear failure  Structural damages  Tsunamis  building  damage mechanics  failure analysis  reinforced concrete  shear stress  structural analysis,1,1
12600,"A damage data database of 131 reinforced concrete (RC) buildings, collected after 2009 L'Aquila (Italy) earthquake, is employed for the evaluation of observational fragility curves. The specific interpretation of damage data allowed carrying out fragility curves for slight, moderate, and heavy damage, (i.e., DS1, DS2, and DS3), defined according to EMS 98 macroseismic scale. Observational fragility curves are then employed for the calibration of FAST analytical methodology. FAST method is a spectral based approach, meant for the estimate of fragility curves of infilled RC buildings up to DS3, evaluated, again, according to EMS98. Kullback-Leibler divergence is employed to check the matching between analytical and observational fragilities. FAST input variables can vary in quite large ranges and the calibration provides a valuable suggestion for the application of the method in other cases in which field damage data are not available. Results showed that optimizing values, for the input variables calibrated, are in good agreement with typical values assumed in literature. Analytical results showed a very satisfactory agreement with observational data for DS2 and DS3, while systematical underestimation was found for the case of DS1.",Analytical versus observational fragilities: the case of Pettino (L'Aquila) damage data database,2015,L'Aquila earthquake  EMS98  Observational fragilities  FAST method  Infills,REINFORCED-CONCRETE BUILDINGS  PERFORMANCE  VULNERABILITY  EARTHQUAKE  FRAMES,1,1
12601,"The latest earthquake disasters have highlighted, once again, poor functioning of the existing masonry structures, and the need to intervene all these structures which have been designed with old regulatory criteria, inadequate or those that have been built before the emergence of design codes. The significant progress made in new criteria of earthquake resistant design, should be extended to all the existing structures, it is therefore essential to identify the degree of seismic performance. Unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings represent a significant portion of the residential structures in Algeria, accounting for more than 60% of existing buildings. In addition to significant population, the brittle nature of URM buildings further supports a thorough consideration of seismic response given the susceptibility to severe failure modes. Currently, there is a pressing need for analytically based fragility curves for URM buildings. In order to improve the estimation of damage state probabilities through the development of simulation-based masonry fragilities, an extensive literature survey is conducted on pushover analysis of URM structures. Structural response is evaluated using an advanced capacity spectrum method. Capacity, demand, and response are thus derived analytically and response data is used to generate an improved and uniform set of fragility curves for use in risk assessment. Seismic fragility curves are expressed in multiple forms for wide range of use in loss-assessment applications. Results are discussed and compared with other relationships developed in the literature. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.",Analytically Derived Fragility Curves and Damage Assessment of Masonrybuildings,2018,None,Concrete buildings  Earthquakes  Masonry materials  Risk assessment  Seismic design  Capacity spectrum method  Earthquake disaster  Earthquake-resistant design  Residential structures  Seismic fragility curves  Seismic Performance  Structural response  Unreinforced masonry  Damage detection,1,1
12607,"In the past few years, the construction of multi-storey timber buildings has increased significantly in locations where high-intensity ground motions are likely to occur. On the other hand, the fast development of wood engineered products, as glued-laminated timber (GLT) and cross-laminated timber (CLT), has been challenging researchers to provide adequate guidelines for the design and assessment of structures built in seismic regions. Some guidelines and analysis methods considered in seismic design can improve robustness, commonly described as the ability of structures to sustain limited damage without disproportionate effects. This paper proposes a probabilistic methodology for seismic and robustness assessment of timber-framed structures. The seismic performance and the progressive collapse potential of a three-storey building are here exemplified through the proposed methodology, which accounts for uncertainties in mechanical properties of members and connections, as well as for external loads. The Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) was used in each assessment to generate a set of 1000 structural models. Each structural model corresponds to a realization of the random variables used to define the structural model. Incremental dynamic analyses were performed to develop seismic fragility curves for different damage levels. The fragility functions for robustness assessment were developed for distinct damage scenarios, exploiting the results of an alternate load path analysis (ALPA) that involved the performance of nonlinear static analyses (pushdown analyses). The methodology presented is suitable for risk-based assessments that consider the occurrence of different exposures, such as earthquakes, impacts, and explosions, while considering the direct and indirect consequences of failures. However, the methodology involves time-consuming analyses with distinct load scenarios, which can constitute a burdening task within a typical building design phase. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Application of Fragility Analysis to Timber-Framed Structures for Seismic and Robustness Assessments,2021,Robustness assessment  Seismic assessment  Timber structures,Architectural design  Damage detection  Laminating  Office buildings  Product design  Regression analysis  Robustness (control systems)  Seismology  Structural analysis  Structural frames  Timber  Wooden buildings  Glued-laminated timber  Incremental dynamic analysis  Latin hypercube sampling  Non-linear static analysis  Probabilistic methodology  Risk-based assessments  Seismic fragility curves  Time consuming analysis  Seismic design,1,1
12612,"This article deals with the application of an analytical methodology for the large-scale vulnerability assessment of reinforced concrete frame buildings in Italy. This methodology is known in the technical literature with the acronym SP-BELA (Simplified Pushover-Based Earthquake Loss Assessment) and has been adopted by the Eucentre research group to contribute to the production of the seismic risk maps in Italy, published in the National Risk Assessment document. The Italian maps were elaborated using the IRMA platform (Italian Risk MAps), which is a web platform developed by Eucentre. The IRMA platform is only addressed to the scientific community who can use it to share data, methods, and models for the evaluation of the seismic risk in Italy (Borzi et al. in Piattaforma IRMA Italian Risk MAps, 2018; Dolce et al. in Mappe di rischio per il territorio Italiano, 2019a; Faravelli et al. in Italian platform for seismic risk and damage scenario evaluation, 2019a, Borzi et al. in Bull Earthq Eng, 2020, Dolce et al. Bull Earthq Eng, 2020). SP-BELA defines the non-linear behaviour of a random population of buildings through a simplified pushover and a displacement-based procedure. Specifically, displacement capacity limits are identified on the pushover curve and then they are compared with the displacement demand from a response spectrum of each building in the random population. In this way, it is possible to define the probability of exceedance of the damage limits and hence generate the fragility curves. Then, the resulting curves have been calibrated by comparing the damage data observed on the reinforced concrete buildings with the damage analytically calculated with SP-BELA for the earthquakes of Molise 2002 and L’Aquila 2009. The final curves have been uploaded into the IRMA platform and used to produce damage maps for the entire national territory. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Application of the SP-BELA methodology to RC residential buildings in Italy to produce seismic risk maps for the national risk assessment,2021,Analytical method  Fragility curves  RC buildings  Seismic risk  Seismic vulnerability,Concrete buildings  Concrete construction  Data Sharing  Earthquakes  Maps  Reinforced concrete  Risk perception  Analytical methodology  Displacement capacity  Nonlinear behaviours  Probability of exceedance  Reinforced concrete frame buildings  Residential building  Scientific community  Vulnerability assessments  Risk assessment  building  displacement  earthquake event  methodology  reinforced concrete  risk assessment  vulnerability  Italy  Aquila,1,1
12615,"Flood risk modelling aims to quantify the probability of flooding and the resulting consequences for exposed elements. The assessment of flood damage is a core task that requires the description of complex flood damage processes including the influences of flooding intensity and vulnerability characteristics. Multi-variable modelling approaches are better suited for this purpose than simple stage-damage functions. However, multi-variable flood vulnerability models require detailed input data and often have problems in predicting damage for regions other than those for which they have been developed. A transfer of vulnerability models usually results in a drop of model predictive performance. Here we investigate the questions as to whether data from the open-data source OpenStreetMap is suitable to model flood vulnerability of residential buildings and whether the underlying standardized data model is helpful for transferring models across regions. We develop a new data set by calculating numerical spatial measures for residential-building footprints and combining these variables with an empirical data set of observed flood damage. From this data set random forest regression models are learned using regional subsets and are tested for predicting flood damage in other regions. This regional split-sample validation approach reveals that the predictive performance of models based on OpenStreetMap building geometry data is comparable to alternative multi-variable models, which use comprehensive and detailed information about preparedness, socio-economic status and other aspects of residential-building vulnerability. The transfer of these models for application in other regions should include a test of model performance using independent local flood data. Including numerical spatial measures based on OpenStreetMap building footprints reduces model prediction errors (MAE - mean absolute error - by 20% and MSE - mean squared error - by 25 %) and increases the reliability of model predictions by a factor of 1.4 in terms of the hit rate when compared to a model that uses only water depth as a predictor. This applies also when the models are transferred to other regions which have not been used for model learning. Further, our results show that using numerical spatial measures derived from OpenStreetMap building footprints does not resolve all problems of model transfer. Still, we conclude that these variables are useful proxies for flood vulnerability modelling because these data are consistent (i.e. input variables and underlying data model have the same definition, format, units, etc.) and openly accessible and thus make it easier and more cost-effective to transfer vulnerability models to other regions.",Are OpenStreetMap building data useful for flood vulnerability modelling?,2021,None,JUNE 2013  AFFECTED RESIDENTS  NATURAL HAZARDS  RISK-ASSESSMENT  DAMAGE MODELS  EXTREME FLOOD  EXPOSURE  GERMANY  TRANSFERABILITY  PREPAREDNESS,1,1
12636,"Designer engineers have always the serious challenge regarding the choice of the kind of structures to use in the areas with significant seismic activities. Development of fragility curve provides an opportunity for designers to select a structure that will have the least fragility. This paper presents an investigation into the seismic vulnerability of both steel and reinforced concrete (RC) moment frames using fragility curves obtained by HAZUS and statistical methodologies. Fragility curves are employed for several probability parameters. Fragility curves are used to assess several probability parameters. Furthermore, it examines whether the probability of the exceedence of the damage limit state is reduced as expected. Nonlinear dynamic analyses of five-, eight-, and twelve-story frames are carried out using Perform 3D. The definition of damage states is based on the descriptions provided by HAZUS, which gives the limit states and the associated interstory drift limits for structures. The fragility curves show that the HAZUS procedure reduces probability of damage, and this reduction is higher for RC frames. Generally, the RC frames have higher fragility compared to steel frames. © 2017 Iman Mansouri et al.",Assessment of Seismic Vulnerability of Steel and RC Moment Buildings Using HAZUS and Statistical Methodologies,2017,None,None,1,1
12645,"Empirical tsunami fragility curves are developed based on a Bayesian framework by accounting for uncertainty of input tsunami hazard data in a systematic and comprehensive manner. Three fragility modeling approaches, i.e. lognormal method, binomial logistic method, and multinomial logistic method, are considered, and are applied to extensive tsunami damage data for the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. A unique aspect of this study is that uncertainty of tsunami inundation data (i.e. input hazard data in fragility modeling) is quantified by comparing two tsunami inundation/run-up datasets (one by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transportation of the Japanese Government and the other by the Tohoku Tsunami Joint Survey group) and is then propagated through Bayesian statistical methods to assess the effects on the tsunami fragility models. The systematic implementation of the data and methods facilitates the quantitative comparison of tsunami fragility models under different assumptions. Such comparison shows that the binomial logistic method with un-binned data is preferred among the considered models; nevertheless, further investigations related to multinomial logistic regression with un-binned data are required. Finally, the developed tsunami fragility functions are integrated with building damage-loss models to investigate the influences of different tsunami fragility curves on tsunami loss estimation. Numerical results indicate that the uncertainty of input tsunami data is not negligible (coefficient of variation of 0.25) and that neglecting the input data uncertainty leads to overestimation of the model uncertainty. © 2016, The Author(s).",Bayesian tsunami fragility modeling considering input data uncertainty,2017,2011 Tohoku earthquake  Bayesian regression  Logistic regression  Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation  Multinomial regression  Tsunami fragility,Earthquakes  Floods  Geophysics  Hazards  Input output programs  Intelligent systems  Markov processes  Monte Carlo methods  Regression analysis  Uncertainty analysis  2011 tohoku earthquakes  Bayesian regression  Logistic regressions  Markov chain monte carlo simulation  Multinomials  Tsunamis  Bayesian analysis  computer simulation  Markov chain  modeling  Monte Carlo analysis  regression analysis  Tohoku earthquake 2011  tsunami  uncertainty analysis,1,1
12666,"A combination of a deterministic approach and fragility analysis is applied to assess tsunami damage caused to buildings. The area selected to validate the model is Imwon Port in Korea. The deterministic approach includes numerical modeling of tsunami propagation in the East Sea following an earthquake on the western coast of Japan. The model is based on the linear shallow-water equations (LSWE) augmented with Boussinesq approximation to account for dispersion effects in wave propagation, and coastal wave run-up is modeled by non-linear shallow-water equations (NLSWE). The output from the deterministic model comprises inundation depth. The numerical output is used to perform fragility analysis for buildings vulnerable to flooding by tsunamis in the port area. Recently developed fragility curves-based on the ordinal regression method-are used for damage probability estimates. The extent of structural damage in the areas under a tsunami hazard is identified by the numerical modeling of tsunami features. Our numerical model offers high bathymetric resolution, which enables us to capture flow features at the individual structure level and results in improved estimation of damage probability. This approach can serve as a measure of assessing structure vulnerability for areas with little or no records of tsunami damage and provide planners with a better understanding of structure behavior when a tsunami strikes. © 2016 by the authors.",Building damage assessment using scenario based tsunami numerical analysis and fragility curves,2016,Floods  Fragility analysis  Inundation depths  Structures  Tsunami hazard  Tsunami modeling,Damage detection  Equations of motion  Floods  Hazards  Regression analysis  Structural analysis  Structure (composition)  Tsunamis  Wave propagation  Boussinesq approximations  Deterministic approach  Fragility analysis  Inundation depths  Linear shallow water equations  Non-linear shallow water equations  Tsunami hazards  Tsunami models  Numerical models  Boussinesq equation  building  earthquake event  flood damage  flooding  hazard assessment  numerical model  probability  shallow-water equation  tsunami  vulnerability  wave dispersion  wave propagation  Imwon  Kangwon  Korea  Pacific Ocean  Sea of Japan  South Korea,1,1
12675,"Recently proposed capacity-based damage indices and parametric models for capacity curves are applied to frame steel buildings located in soft soils of the Mexico City. To do that, the seismic performance of 2D models of low-, mid- and high-rise buildings is assessed. Deterministic and probabilistic nonlinear static and incremental dynamic analyses are implemented. Monte Carlo simulations and the Latin Hypercube sampling technique are used. Seismic actions are selected among accelerograms recorded in the study area. Spectral matching techniques are applied, so that the acceleration time histories have a predefined mean response spectrum and controlled error. The design spectrum of the Mexican seismic code for the zone is used as target spectrum. The well-known Park and Ang damage index allows calibrating the capacity-based damage index. Both damage indices take into account the contribution to damage of the stiffness degradation and of the energy dissipation. Damage states and fragility curves are also obtained and discussed in detail. The results reveal the versatility, robustness and reliability of the parametric model for capacity curves, which allow modelling the nonlinear part of the capacity curves by the cumulative integral of a cumulative lognormal function. However, these new capacity-based damage index and capacity models have been tested for and applied to 2D frame buildings only; they have not been applied to 3D building models yet. The Park and Ang and the capacity-based damage indices show that for the analysed buildings, the contribution to damage of the stiffness degradation is in the range 66-77% and that of energy loss is in the range 29-34%. The lowest contribution of energy dissipation (29%) is found for the low-rise, more rigid, building. The energy contribution would raise with the ductility of the building and with the duration of the strong ground motion. High-rise frame buildings in soft soils of Mexico City show the worst performance so that the use of adequate braced frames to control the displacements could be recommended.","Capacity, damage and fragility models for steel buildings: a probabilistic approach",2018,Non-linear structural analysis  Parametric model  Monte Carlo simulation  Steel buildings  Damage assessment,SEISMIC RISK  INDEX  PERFORMANCE  STRENGTH  VULNERABILITY  PUSHOVER  BEHAVIOR  DESIGN,1,1
12681,"Risk management programs and catastrophe models use fragility and vulnerability curves extensively. For the case of coastal flood events, the independent variable for these damage functions is usually the inundation depth, sometimes combined with some expression of water velocity or wave action. Postdisaster surveys often provide the basis for these damage functions, where the investigators classify the observed damage into broad categories based on qualitative descriptions. This paper describes a method to transform these qualitative evaluations into quantitative descriptions of damage states, which are then applied to develop fragility and vulnerability curves. The authors present this process within the context of the development of coastal flood fragility and vulnerability functions for the Florida Public Hurricane Loss Model. The model characterizes and quantifies the damage states specific to a set of fragility curves by using damage distributions and component cost analysis and transforms the fragility curves into a vulnerability curve. The paper analyzes the uncertainties in the model due to the number and quantification of the damage states and an adjustment function included in the discretization process. The analysis shows that the number of damage states governs the overall uncertainty.

12686,"The objective of this study was to determine the collapse risk of fail-safe reinforced concrete (RC) frames due to earthquakes by newly developed fragility curves. The curves were constructed based on the collapse mechanism, instead of measures of lateral drift as customarily adopted. The procedure was applied to RC open frames that were seismic resistant. A fail-safe mechanism was imposed by allowing plastic hinges to be formed mainly in the beams. This automatically satisfied the stronger column-weaker beam requirement; shear failure was neither tolerated anywhere in the columns nor in the beams. Two kinds of fail-safe RC frames were investigated: Special moment resisting frames (SMF) and ordinary moment resisting frames (OMF). Their earthquake collapse risk was computed and compared. Inelastic time history (NLTH) and the non-linear static procedure (NSP) were conducted to assess their structural performance. The results showed among others that the fail-safe OMF had lower collapse risk than the fail-safe SMF. The collapse prevention performance level in NLTH could only be achieved for the fail-safe frames. The non-linear time history analysis should be the only method used for seismic reevaluation/safety checking of building frame structures. © 2019 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Collapse risks of fail-safe rc frames due to earthquakes: Fragility assessments,2019,Collapse risk  Earthquake  Fail-safe reinforced concrete frame  Fragility  NSP  Time history,Earthquake engineering  Earthquakes  Steel beams and girders  Structural analysis  Structural frames  Collapse prevention  Collapse risks  Fail-safe mechanism  Fragility  Fragility assessment  Reinforced concrete frames  Special moment-resisting frames  Structural performance  Reinforced concrete,1,1
12691,"The use of different approaches in the development of flood damage models in various countries is expected to affect flood damage modelling at a regional or global scale. Since these models are often used as tools for disaster management and decision making, it is very needful to understand the comparative similarity and differences in countries’ loss models; this can help in the overall integration for developing regional risk models and cross-country risk assessment. In this study, empirically generated generalised loss models in three Asian countries (Sri Lanka, Thailand and Japan) were compared and applied to estimate potential flood damages in two different urban river basins. For each case study, each model was normalised using cost prices and floor areas (as applied to each country) and were integrated within the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to estimate damages for the flood events. Using the mean vulnerability index of corresponding building types for the selected countries, a single model for regional flood risk assessment was created. However, the study showed that there are variations in the vulnerability and the potential flood damage estimates of similar global building types from the three countries, despite being developed by the same approach. These are attributed to the country’s specific conditions such as building regulations and codes, GDP per capita, cost price of building materials. Our results suggest that the average vulnerability index from the countries however reduced potential errors in the estimates. Moreover, it is proposed that the average regional vulnerability model derived with empirical data inputs from all the countries for regional risk assessment and cross-country comparison. Therefore, it can predict near accurate potential flood damages, which can serve as measures for regional flood disaster risk management plans. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Comparative analyses of flood damage models in three Asian countries: towards a regional flood risk modelling,2019,Flood damage  GIS  Risk  Vulnerability,comparative study  decision making  disaster management  environmental risk  flood  flood damage  GIS  Gross Domestic Product  modeling  risk assessment  river basin  vulnerability  Japan  Sri Lanka  Thailand,1,1

Specifically, as regards the seismic risk assessment, six research units belonging to two centres of competence of the DPC collaborated under its guidance to update the risk maps of the Italian residential heritage. This extensive collaboration complied with the recent Italian code for Civil Protection, which requires a broad scientific consensus for risk assessment. During this research activity, six fragility models were developed, according to some common criteria (four for masonry buildings and two for RC buildings). These models were then implemented by the DPC for the definition of the national seismic risk. Within this context, the aim of this paper is to evaluate the risk results provided by these models, compare their features, and assess and validate their prediction capabilities. In particular, this paper shows the comparison of predicted and observed damage scenarios and consequences on building stock and the population of two seismic events, i.e. L’Aquila 2009 and Amatrice 2016. Furthermore, the paper provides some interesting damage and risk predictions at a national level.

12745,"Large reserves of unexploited shale gas in Brazil have recently been reported, some of them located near densely populated cities. Obviously, the possibility for commercial exploitation of these resources has suddenly arisen, although such activities have been found to be correlated with the occurrence of induced earthquakes in other parts of the word. As in many other countries, in Brazil, making provision for the eventual effects of induced seismicity was not a consideration when the seismic standards were developed. Today, we do know about the possibility of induced earthquakes occurring, but the knowledge about the potential extent of the resulting damages remains imperfect, at best. Consequently, studies such as the one presented here, and another recently completed, are a first step to improve the knowledge base of the potential risk of induced earthquakes in Brazil for devising adequate risk-control mechanisms. This study assesses the probabilistic response to induced earthquakes of prevalent low-rise engineered reinforced concrete buildings in Brazil. Fragility functions are developed, considering structural and non-structural damage, and including the structural contribution of masonry infills. It was found that, when infill walls do not work as structural components, structural damage is more likely to occur, and conversely, when they do, non-structural damage is significant. The latter effect is produced by the reduction of the natural period of vibration, which exacerbates damage on interior components sensitive to floor acceleration.

12748,"This paper presents fragility curves for conventional low-rise light-frame wood buildings in southwestern British Columbia, Canada, for long duration subduction earthquakes. Computational models of four representative two-story houses (two engineered and two non-engineered) are developed and validated using full-scale shake table testing data. Damage states are evaluated using the Park and Ang damage index. Incremental dynamic analyses are employed for calibrating and assessing the index. Duration effects are investigated by using 30 long duration subduction motions and 30 “spectrally equivalent” short duration crustal motions. The results indicate that the considered houses are more vulnerable to damage under subduction motions which increase the median damage indices of both individual shearwalls and entire lateral systems for all four houses at the same level of ground shaking. The correlation between system damage indices with ground motion duration was dependent on the level of ground shaking and the seismic resistance of the systems. The results further demonstrate that exterior stucco finish greatly reduces the seismic damage and can be used as an effective seismic retrofit strategy for conventional non-engineered wood construction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Damage index fragility assessment of low-rise light-frame wood buildings under long duration subduction earthquakes,2020,Fragility curve  Ground motion duration  Incremental dynamic analyses  Structural damage  Subduction earthquake,Building materials  Earthquake effects  Earthquake engineering  Houses  Structural analysis  Wooden buildings  Wooden construction  Fragility curves  Ground motions  Incremental dynamic analysis  Structural damages  Subduction earthquakes  Damage detection,1,1
12753,"The Northeast region of India is considered to be the most seismically active zone in India, having witnessed two major earthquakes (Mw &gt; 8) in the past. Recently, the 2017 Ambasa earthquake (with Mw of 5.7) caused significant damage to unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings in Tripura, a Northeast state of India. The typical nature of damage observed in URM buildings during the post-earthquake damage survey highlights poor construction practices that have been used in this region even though the seismic hazard of the Northeast region of India is well established. In this context, the present study is an effort to evaluate through fragility analysis the vulnerability of existing low-rise URM buildings in Agartala, the capital city of Tripura, which in a broader sense represents the buildings of the entire Northeast region of India, through fragility analysis. In this regard, an assessment method based on a nonlinear static approach is used to develop bilinear capacity curve parameters. The capacity curve parameters are then used to estimate fragility functions. Fragility analysis shows that URM buildings would suffer heavy damage even for an earthquake having Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) of 0.18 g, which is used to design buildings in the Northeast region of India according to the Indian seismic code. Fragility curves developed in this study may prove useful for assessing the seismic risk of the same building typology in other urban areas of Northeast India.

12758,"The aim of this work is to open up new opportunities for designers towards a performance-based approach to derive fragilities at design stage. Nonlinear Time-History Analysis (NTHA) represents the current practice for the estimation of damage within the Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering (PBEE) framework. Among the NTHA approaches for fragility assessment, Cloud Analysis (CA) represents a convenient tool which allows evaluating the parameters of the conditional demand distribution based on simple regression of cloud-dispersed data points obtained from recorded ground motions. Notwithstanding the growth in computer processing power and software development, NTHA is generally time-consuming and it requires advanced expertise in nonlinear modelling, preventing its use in the professional field at design stage. Herein, a novel procedure for deriving fragility curves built up through Linear Time-History Analysis (LTHA) and CA is presented. It can be employed within a simplified PBEE approach at design stage for performance comparison of design solutions. Differences between LTHA results and those obtained through NTHA are compared for the assessment of a 12-storey Reinforced-Concrete Moment-Resisting-Frame building designed according to Eurocode 8. Assessment is performed for two limit states: Life Safety- and Damage Limitation- Limit State. Critical aspects for LTHA-based fragility assessment such as (i) influence of ground motion suite size and (ii) identification of “unacceptable cases” are investigated. The final level of approximation of these “design-fragilities” is very satisfactory making the full approach pursuable and useful for professional applications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Derivation of fragility curves at design stage through linear time-history analysis,2020,Cloud analysis  Eurocode 8  Fragility curves  Ground motion selection  Time-history analysis  Unacceptable cases,Damage detection  Earthquake engineering  Reinforced concrete  Computer processing power  Fragility assessment  Moment resisting frames  Non-linear modelling  Nonlinear time history analysis  Performance based approach  Performance comparison  Performance-based earthquake engineering  Software design  concrete structure  earthquake damage  earthquake engineering  ground motion  linearity  multistorey building  performance assessment  regression analysis  reinforced concrete  seismic design,1,1
12761,"The development of fragility curves to perform seismic scenario-based risk assessment requires a fully probabilistic procedure in order to account for uncertainties at each step of the computation. This is especially true when developing fragility curves conditional on an Intensity Measure that is directly available from a ground-motion prediction equation. In this study, we propose a new derivation method that uses realistic spectra instead of design spectral shapes or uniform hazard spectra and allows one to easily account for the features of the site-specific hazard that influences the fragility, without using non-linear dynamic analysis. The proposed method has been applied to typical school building types in the city of Basel (Switzerland) and the results have been compared to the standard practice in Europe. The results confirm that fragility curves are scenario dependent and are particularly sensitive to the magnitude of the earthquake scenario. The same background theory used for the derivation of the fragility curves has allowed an innovative method to be proposed for the conversion of fragility curves to a common IM (i.e. spectral acceleration or PGA). This conversion is the only way direct comparisons of fragility curves can be made and is useful when inter-period correlation cannot be used in scenario loss assessment. Moreover, such conversion is necessary to compare and verify newly developed curves against those from previous studies. Conversion to macroseismic intensity is also relevant for the comparison between mechanical-based and empirical fragility curves, in order to detect possible biases. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Deriving fragility functions from bilinearized capacity curves for earthquake scenario modelling using the conditional spectrum,2018,Conditional spectrum  Fragility curves  Inter-period correlation  Mechanical method  Uncertainties  Vulnerability assessment,Computation theory  Equations of motion  Hazards  Motion estimation  Risk assessment  Risk perception  Conditional spectrums  Fragility curves  Mechanical methods  Uncertainties  Vulnerability assessments  Earthquakes  bearing capacity  correlation  earthquake  modeling  risk assessment  scenario analysis  statistical analysis  uncertainty analysis  vulnerability  Basel  Basel-Stadt  Europe  Switzerland,1,1
12767,"Several evaluation methods of the seismic vulnerability have been developed around the world. Which are very use ful from humanitarian and socioeconomic point of view. Generally these methods use knowledge obtained from previous earthquakes and they are basing on seismic intensity scales and on buildings direct observation. But the macroseismic intensity expresses the consequences of the seism, and not its physical characteristics of the structures. Contrary to this type of methods, an approach based on a nonlinear analysis (Push-Over method) is proposed in this work. It consists in modeling the excitation of the earthquake by a response spectrum and building's behavior by capacity curves. These capacity curves are obtained from numerical modeling performed by Opensees software. The superposition of the two curves, response spectra and capacity curve, makes it possible to determine the performance point and consequently to deduce the state of expected damage. To estimate the probability of damage of a building at a given level of solicitation (defined by Sd), we excites a group of buildings characterized by different parameters related to the geometry of the building and those are related to the materials used (concrete, steel) by seismic solicitation (Response spectrum - RPA 99). The performance point for each building is determined by a procedure defined in FEMA 440. We classifies the buildings according to the position of performance point on their curve which defines a damage state of ds (Mild, Moderate, Important or Ruin) according to the damage levels of Risk-UE. A statistical analysis is then made for each class to build the fragility curves. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.",Developed approach to determine the seismic vulnerability of reinforced concrete structures,2018,None,Buildings  Concretes  Geophysics  Nonlinear analysis  Reinforced concrete  Seismology  Stability  Direct observations  Evaluation methods  Macroseismic intensity  Performance points  Physical characteristics  Probability of damages  Seismic intensity  Seismic vulnerability  Earthquakes,1,1
12775,"Iran is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. In recent earthquakes, the low quality of constructions has caused huge losses, both in human and economic terms. The high level of seismic hazard in combination with a high physical vulnerability of structures leads to a high earthquake risk of Iran, which has to be managed in some ways. Earthquake happening in populated areas causing economic and human losses has shown the vital role of assessing buildings' vulnerabilities as well as loss estimations. Vulnerability curve is one of the essential instruments to evaluate structural losses before the events. Regarding the lack of categorized vulnerability curves for Iranian buildings, this study focuses on filling this critical gap. For this reason, empirical approach involving statistical processing on existing data from the previous studies is used to develop vulnerability curves for Iranian buildings by critiquing the existing fragility/vulnerability curves in Iran and other countries. The logic-tree method is used to combine these curves by weighting in accordance with the condition of construction provisions, seismic code and engineering judgment. Finally, vulnerability curves are developed for the 42 Iranian building types. Results are presented by median (Sa) and lognormal standard deviation (β S a) values for all types of selected buildings and related uncertainties are considered as well. © 2015 Institution of Mechanical Engineers.",Developing seismic vulnerability curves for typical Iranian buildings,2015,earthquake risk  fragility curve  Iran  logic-tree method  Seismic vulnerability curve  structural loss,Buildings  Data handling  Geophysics  Seismology  Earthquake risk  Fragility curves  Iran  Logic tree  Seismic vulnerability curves  Structural loss  Earthquakes,1,1
12777,"The last earthquake that affected the city of Coquimbo took place in September 2015 and had a magnitude of M-w = 8.3, resulting in localized damage in low-lying areas of the city. In addition, another seismic gap north of the 2015 earthquake rupture area has been identified; therefore, a significant earthquake (M-w = 8.2 to 8.5) and tsunami could occur in the near future. The present paper develops a tsunami fragility curve for the city of Coquimbo based on field survey data and tsunami numerical simulations. The inundation depth of the 2015 Chile tsunami in Coquimbo was estimated by means of numerical simulation with the Non-hydrostatic Evolution of Ocean WAVEs (NEOWAVE) model and five nested grids with a maximum grid resolution of 10 m. The fragility curve exhibited behavior similar to that of other curves in flat areas in Japan, where little damage was observed at relatively high inundation depths. In addition, it was observed that Coquimbo experienced less damage than Dichato (Chile); in fact, at an inundation depth of 2 m, Dichato had a similar to 75% probability of damage, while Coquimbo proved to have only a 20% probability. The new fragility curve was used to estimate the damage by possible future tsunamis in the area. The damage assessment showed that similar to 50% of the structures in the low-lying area of Coquimbo have a high probability of damage in the case of a tsunami generated off the coast of the study area if the city is rebuilt with the same types of structures.","Development and application of a tsunami fragility curve of the 2015 tsunami in Coquimbo, Chile",2018,None,W 8.3 ILLAPEL  INDIAN-OCEAN  HAZARD ASSESSMENT  INUNDATION DEPTH  SUBDUCTION ZONE  BUILDING DAMAGE  RUPTURE PROCESS  MOMENTUM FLUX  SOURCE MODELS  EARTHQUAKE,1,1
12781,"A simplified analytical method for the seismic fragility assessment of Reinforced Concrete buildings at large scale is presented. The proposed method is based on a simulated design procedure to define the structural model and on non-linear static analysis of a simplified structural model based on Shear-Type assumption to evaluate seismic capacity. Damage States are defined according to the observational-based Damage States provided by the European Macroseismic Scale (EMS-98). Presence of infills is considered, both taking into account their influence on the structural response and evaluating the damage to such non-structural elements. The method is applied to the Reinforced Concrete building stock data provided by the field survey carried out on a city in a high seismic area in Southern Italy, which are illustrated and compared with data from other sources. Uncertainties in seismic demand, material characteristics, and capacity models are taken into account through a Monte Carlo simulation technique. Fragility curves are obtained for each building, leading to the evaluation of annual failure probability at the assumed Damage States. The influence of key parameters in predicting seismic fragility, such as the number of storeys and the age of construction, is illustrated. The spatial distribution of annual failure probability at the different Damage States provides information on areas most prone to seismic risk within the city, depending both on building stock characteristics and on local amplification of seismic hazard due to soil conditions. A comparison with empirical-based fragility curves from literature is also illustrated. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Development and urban-scale application of a simplified method for seismic fragility assessment of RC buildings,2015,Building stock data  Infills  Large scale  Reinforced Concrete buildings  Simplified seismic fragility assessment,Buildings  Concrete buildings  Concretes  Intelligent systems  Monte Carlo methods  Probability distributions  Reinforced concrete  Seismic design  Seismology  Annual failure probability  Building stocks  Infills  Large scale  Monte carlo simulation technique  Non-linear static analysis  Seismic fragility  Simplified analytical methods  Structural design  building  earthquake damage  infill  reinforced concrete  seismic hazard  seismic response  urban area  Italy,1,1
12788,"Depth vs. damage curves were developed for a flood risk assessment carried out in Colombo, Sri Lanka. The major elements of the damage assessment comprised building fabrics, building contents, distributed infrastructure and vehicles. Current approaches to damage function development were improved on by separating damage to building fabric and contents; using actual building footprints rather than assigning building functions to city zones; assessing infrastructure damage accurately; and incorporating damage to vehicles. Information sources included infrastructure agencies, bills of quantities for buildings, expert consultations, household surveys and insurance agencies. The building fabric was assigned three categories, namely semi-permanent, single storey and two storey. The building contents were classified into 7 types based on function as warehouse/storage, industrial, shops, offices, residential, educational and health. The proportion of contents asset values to that of the fabric ranged from 1.67 for warehouse/storage to 0.20for educational. Both 'what-if' analyses and historic data were used to generate the curves. Data were obtained as losses per unit area or unit length; or as point losses.For the 140 square km urban area, the generated flood damages ranged from USD 37 to 549 million for return periods from 5 to 100 years, with average inundation depths ranging from 0.48 m to 1.28 m (and outliers up to 5.8 m). The total non-residential to residential building damage increased with return period (and together accounted for 75-85% of damage). The residential contents to fabric damage ratio was generally around 1.5. The percentage damage to infrastructure was not very significant, although that to vehicles was, especially at lower return periods. © 2018 The Authors.

12789,"The Thabeikkyin earthquake (moment magnitude scale of 6.8) occurred on November 11, 2012; its epicenter was located 25 km from Thabeikkyin Township, Mandalay Region, Myanmar. Many buildings were damaged severely during the earthquake. In this study, damage patterns of brick-nogging buildings were firstly developed, and damage grades were characterized to allow for easy classification of the damaged buildings. The damaged data of all building types in the surveyed areas were collected by classifying the four damage levels as no damage, slight damage, moderate damage, and heavy damage. To develop the damage patterns of brick-nogging buildings, damage categories were arranged into three damage grades (slight, moderate, and heavy damage). Secondly, a questionnaire survey was conducted to calculate the seismic intensities of the affected areas. Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik (MSK) seismic intensities for the surveyed areas were estimated by analyzing the questionnaire survey responses. Finally, fragility curves for brick-nogging buildings were constructed using the estimated seismic intensities from the survey responses combined with the damage levels. These fragility curves may be useful to assess damage to brick-nogging buildings and to predict the number of damaged buildings in future earthquakes. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Development of Damage Patterns and Fragility Curves in Brick-nogging Buildings from the Thabeikkyin Earthquake, Myanmar, 2012",2018,2012 Thabeikkyin Earthquake  Brick-Nogging Building  Damage Pattern  Fragility Curve  MSK Seismic Intensity  Questionnaire Survey,Brick  Buildings  Phase shift keying  Surveys  Brick nogging  Damage Pattern  Fragility curves  Questionnaire surveys  Seismic intensity  Earthquakes,1,1
12791,"As a function of fragility curves in earthquake engineering, the assessment of the probability of exceeding a specific damage state according to the magnitude of earthquake can be considered. Considering that the damage states for fragility curves are generally nested to each other, the possibility theory, a special form of the evidence theory for nested intervals, is applied to generate fragility information from seismic damage data. While the lognormal distributions are conventionally used to generate fragility curves due to their simplicity and applicability, the methodology to use the possibility theory does not require the assumption of distributions. Seismic damage data classified by four damage levels were used for a case study. The resulted possibility-based fragility information expressed by two monotone measures, possibility and certainty, are compared with the conventional fragility curves based on probability. The results showed that the conventional fragility curves provide a conservative estimation at the relatively high earthquake magnitude compared with the possibility-based fragility information.",Development of Empirical Fragility Curves in Earthquake Engineering considering Nonspecific Damage Information,2018,None,VULNERABILITY  BUILDINGS  UNCERTAINTIES  ASSESSMENTS,1,1
12795,"This study aims to develop the fragility curve of reinforced concrete buildings with different height based on dynamic analysis. There are 4 models of the moment-resisting concrete frame (MRCF) were used, which are 10, 15, 20, and 25-storey. Each of these frames was designed based on Eurocode 2. The SAP2000 program was used as the main analysis tool to obtain the limit state of MRCF. Then, an incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) was carried out with 7 ground motion records obtained from the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center (PEER). The IDA curves were compared with the limit state of the MRCF, which is maximum allowable drift. The calculation of maximum allowable drift is based on the formula from the International Building Code (IBC, 2003). From the IDA results, 10-storey MRCF has better structural performance under the same ground motion as compared to other MRCF (10, 15, 20, and 25-storey). Fragility curves were developed by considering the results of IDA as parameters. Based on the results of the fragility curve, the MRCF that has the highest probability of exceeding the limit state is 25-storey MRCF. This is because 25-storey MRCF has the lowest PGA at 100% probability. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Development of Fragility Curve of Reinforced Concrete Buildings with Different Height Based on Dynamic Analysis,2021,Drift limit  Fragility curve  Ground motions  Incremental dynamic analysis  Reinforced concrete,None,1,1

A database describing the geometric properties (walls density, building area, height) of this type of structure was developed using data from field surveys. This information was complemented with results from experimental tests to compute a large set of capacity curves using a mechanical procedure. These models were tested against a set of ground motion records using the displacement-based earthquake loss assessment (DBELA) procedure, and the structural responses were used to derive fragility functions for four building classes.

12798,"The objective of this study is to develop analytical fragility curves for an ensemble of existing 3-to 6-story residential steel buildings with concentrically braced frames in 2 directions, designed during 2010 to 2015 in Qazvin, Iran. The buildings were modeled three-dimensionally in OpenSees considering braces buckling behavior. Maximum Inter-story Drift Ratio (.MIDR) and spectral acceleration at. fundamental period of the structure with 5% viscous damping (Sa(7\,5%)) were considered as Damage Index (DI) and Intensity Measure (/M), respectively. Limit states were specified as discussed in FEMA 356. Ground motion record selection and uncertainties assessment were carried out based on FEMA P695 methodology. Analysis was performed using truncated Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA). Fragility function was defined as a log-normal Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) and maximum likelihood method was used to estimate fragility parameters. According to the fragility curves obtained, seismic vulnerability of the structures generally increased as the number of stories rose. Concentration of the inelasticity was also found to be mainly at. the first, story level. The results also confirmed the fact that the record t o record variability is the main source of uncertainty in structural probabilistic evaluation. © 2019 Sharif University of Technology.

12802,"Risk models, which describe the relationship between hazard intensity and a damage ratio are Increasingly used in flood risk management. Direct tangible damage resulting from flooding is typically computed based on the internationally accepted method of depth-damage curves. Depth-damage curves relate absolute damage (in terms of currency) or relative loss (percentage of the estimated total replacement value of property) to a given flood depth. Many depth-damage functions in use today are computed from synthetic data, where data are collected from a representative sample of buildings with similar properties in a floodplain during field surveys. A primary problem when assessing risk at an object-based spatial resolution using depth-damage curves is that these damage functions represent an average structure in the study location. There Is great variability across any given structural class as well as variation within individual structures in a structural category (and across communities), for example, not all one-storey residences with basements are the same size, nor constructed of the same quality of materials and workmanship. The variability within a given class of buildings and the resulting depth-damage curve are often not transparent to the end user, thus damage estimates for individual buildings may be over/under estimated. In this paper, synthetic depth-damage curve data from communities in southern Ontario are used to develop probabilistic cost functions such that monetary damage estimates, as spent in Canadian dollars, and their likelihood of being exceeded at any given flood depth are more clearly expressed and communicated to end users. © 6th International Disaster Mitigation Specialty Conference 2018, Held as Part of the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering Annual Conference 2018.

12803,The present work is to study the effect of Brick Masonry Infill (BMI) in reinforced concrete (RC) building on seismic fragility curves using Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA). Multiple IDA curves which capture the ground motion uncertainties and which govern the shape of fragility curves are developed for twenty real ground motions. Spectral acceleration-based fragility curves and damage probability matrix under various damage states are developed for midrise RC frames with and without BMI. The comparative fragility curves for buildings with and without BMI are presented. It is concluded that the BMI frame have shown superior performance during earthquake in all modes of different damage states and the dispersion of Damage Measures (DM) and Intensity Measures (IM) in IDA analysis are less in the case of BMI thus improve robustness of the building response results in predictability in design.,Development of seismic fragility curves for mid-rise Masonry infilled reinforced concrete building by Incremental Dynamic Analysis,2017,Brick Masonry Infill  Equivalent strut  Fragility analysis  Incremental Dynamic Analysis  Lognormal distribution function  Nonlinear modeling,Brick  Concrete buildings  Concretes  Damage detection  Distribution functions  Dynamic analysis  Earthquake effects  Masonry materials  Seismology  Brick masonry  Equivalent struts  Fragility analysis  Incremental dynamic analysis  Log-normal distribution  Non-linear model  Reinforced concrete,1,1
12804,"Seismic vulnerability assessment of the old buildings assumes great importance, not only because of the obvious physical consequences in the eventual occurrence of a seismic event, but also because it is the aspect in which engineering research can intervene. Unfortunately, due to the lack of knowledge and uncertainties, which appear in case of old existing building in general, or in mixed masonry-reinforced concrete buildings in particular, the assessment of the seismic vulnerability is undoubtedly a challenging task. The object of this paper is to assess the seismic behaviour of mixed masonry-reinforced concrete building class through the nonlinear static sensitivity analyses by considering the uncertainty that reflects the inherent variability of the outcome of a repeatable experiment (aleatory uncertainty) and the seismic demand as provided by EC8. To the latter goal, results from these analyses are used to define the Intensity Measure (IM LS ) and dispersion (β LS ) to the final aim to obtain the fragility curves by quantitatively assessing the effect due to the variability of seismic demand and structural capacity. © 2018 The International Masonry Society (IMS).",Development of seismic fragility curves for mixed masonry-RC buildings in Lisbon,2018,Fragility curves  Mixed masonry-reinforced concrete buildings  Nonlinear static analysis  Seismic assessment  Sensitivity analysis,Concrete buildings  Reinforced concrete  Seismic response  Sensitivity analysis  Aleatory uncertainty  Fragility curves  Inherent variability  Non-linear static analysis  Seismic assessment  Seismic fragility curves  Seismic vulnerability  Structural capacities  Uncertainty analysis,1,1
12806,"Understanding the seismic vulnerability of building structures is important for seismic engineers, building owners, risk insurers and governments. Seismic vulnerability defines a buildings predisposition to be damaged as a result of an earthquake of a given severity. There are two components to seismic risk; the seismic hazard and the exposure of the structural inventory to any given earthquake event. This paper demonstrates the development of fragility curves at different damage states using a detailed mechanical model of a moment resisting reinforced concrete structure typical of Southern Europe. The mechanical model consists of a complex three-dimensional finite element model of the reinforced concrete moment resisting frame structure and is used to define the damage states through pushover analysis. Fragility curves are also defined using the HAZUS macro-seismic methodology and the Risk-UE macro-seismic methodology. Comparison of the mechanically modelled and HAZUS fragility curve shows good agreement while the Risk-UE methodology shows reasonably poor agreement. © McCrum et al.; License Bentham Open.",Development of seismic fragility functions for a moment resisting reinforced concrete framed structure,2016,Abaqus  FEM  Fragility functions  Reinforced concrete  Vulnerability,ABAQUS  Concretes  Finite element method  Geophysics  Reinforced concrete  Seismic design  Seismology  Structural frames  Building structure  Earthquake events  Fragility function  Moment resisting frames  Push-over analysis  Seismic vulnerability  Three dimensional finite element model  Vulnerability  Earthquakes,1,1
12867,"The estimation of flood losses is crucial for the quantitative estimation of risk and the cost–benefit analysis of risk mitigation and prevention measures. Flood losses are usually estimated by means of vulnerability functions, which are often developed in a synthetic way by experts, since loss datasets collected after events are sparse or lacking and mostly refer to slow riverine inundations. Simple univariable empirical vulnerability functions are recognized as a more valuable tool with respect to synthetic curves developed for different contexts. The aim of this work is to derive empirical vulnerability functions for a flash flood event which occurred in Livorno (Italy) in September 2017, based on the hydrologic–hydraulic reconstruction of the flood and observed losses to residential properties. The hydrologic processes are reproduced with a distributed hydrologic model, and the flood propagation is simulated with a full 2D model. Many open GIS data are used and combined with virtual on-site inspection in the study area to analyze building exposure. Different regression curves are tested to fit the data and obtain damage curves. The results show (i) a poor correlation between relative or absolute losses and flow velocity, (ii) a low correlation between relative losses and water depth, thus confirming the existing literature. More significant correlation is found between absolute losses and water depths. The curves here derived provide a first attempt to develop damage functions for flash flood in Italy, which could be applied in similar urban and morphologic contexts. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Empirical flash flood vulnerability functions for residential buildings,2020,Flash flood  Flood damage  Flood risk  Flood vulnerability  Stage–damage function,Cost benefit analysis  Flood damage  Flow velocity  Housing  Risk analysis  Risk assessment  Distributed hydrologic model  Flood propagation  Hydraulic reconstruction  Hydrologic process  On-site inspection  Prevention measures  Quantitative estimation  Residential building  Risk perception,1,1

Seismic vulnerability is described by fragility functions for three vulnerability classes, then refined based on the building height. To this aim, a clustering strategy is implemented to merge predefined building typologies into vulnerability classes, based on the similarity of the observed seismic fragility. On the other side, a specific procedure is built up to determine the vulnerability composition of the exposed URM building stock, starting from national census data. The empirically-derived model was implemented into the national seismic risk platform and used, together with other vulnerability models, for assessing seismic risk in Italy.

12873,"In this study, empirical fragility curves expressed in terms of relationship between damage ratio indices of buildings and ground motion indices were developed in northern Miyagi prefecture located in nearfield areas during the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake. The ground motion indices were evaluated from observed ground motions at strongmotion stations and estimated at sites at which no strong-motion accelerometers were deployed during the mainshock. The ground motions at the noninstrumental sites were estimated using the empirical Green’s function method based on bedrock motions inverted from observed records on surfaces from small events that occurred inside the source fault, transfer functions due to underground velocity structures identified from microtremor H/V spectral ratios, and a short-period source model of the mainshock. The findings indicated that the empirical fragility curves as functions of Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) instrumental seismic intensity during the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake almost corresponded to those during the 1995Kobe Earthquake and the seven disastrous earthquakes that occurred between 2003 and 2008. However, the empirical fragility curves as functions of peak ground velocity were the lowest. A possible reason for this is that the response spectra of the ground motions in the period ranging from 1.0 s to 1.5 s were small during the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake. Another reason could be the seismic resistant capacities of buildings in the studied districts involved during the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake exceeded those in the cities affected during the 1995 Kobe Earthquake. © 2016 Fuji Technology Press Ltd.

12874,"This study investigates the damage data after November 12, 2017, Iran earthquake (Mw 7.3), collected on 440 steel and reinforced concrete residential buildings. Structures have low-to-medium height and are located in Sarpol-e-zahab city, as well as in the west and northwest parts of Kermanshah province, Iran. The peak ground acceleration demands are determined according to data of the micro-shakemap of Sarpol-e-zahab city and the shakemap of Kermanshah province, while the mean values of intensities are determined from the existing empirical relationship between PGA and intensity. The investigated buildings are engineered steel and RC structures nominally erected according to the second and third editions of the Iranian code for earthquake-resistant buildings, but mostly under careless supervision and with low-quality materials. Damage probability matrix, vulnerability index and empirical fragility curves are presented for three subgroups of steel and RC structures on the basis of (i) structural materials and seismic resistant systems (i.e. braced, moment and combination of braced and moment steel frames, as well as moment and combination of moment and shear wall RC frames), without considering the height of structures; (ii) structural materials and height of structures, without considering the seismic resistant systems (i.e. low and medium-height steel and RC structures); (iii) structural materials, without considering the seismic resistant systems and height of structures (i.e. total data for steel and RC frames). The proposed fragility curves are compared with other fragility curves for steel and RC buildings from previous studies. Finally, since this earthquake was the first seismic event in Iran affecting a considerable number of steel and RC engineered buildings, the proposed empirical fragility curves are definitely unique and crucial for realistic damage and vulnerability assessment of similar buildings in future earthquake scenarios, as well as for developing rapid seismic loss assessment after damaging earthquakes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Empirical fragility curves of engineered steel and RC residential buildings after Mw 7.3 2017 Sarpol-e-zahab earthquake,2021,Fragility curves  Iranian building typology  Sarpol-e-zahab earthquake  Seismic vulnerability assessment  Steel and RC buildings,Damage detection  Earthquakes  Housing  Reinforced concrete  Damage probability matrices  Earthquake scenario  Earthquake-resistant buildings  Empirical relationships  Peak ground acceleration  Residential building  Vulnerability assessments  Vulnerability index  Earthquake engineering  earthquake  empirical analysis  reinforced concrete  residential location  steel  vulnerability  Iran  Kermanshah,1,1
12876,"The paper analyses the seismic fragility of precast reinforced concrete buildings using observational damage data gathered after the 2012 Emilia earthquakes that struck Northern Italy. The damage level in 1890 buildings was collected, classified and examined. Damage matrices were then evaluated, and finally, empirical fragility curves were fitted using Bayesian regression. Building damage was classified using a six-level scale derived from EMS-98.

12877,"Empirical seismic fragility curves have been developed based on post-seismic survey data on official building damage, collected in the epicentral area of Mw 6.1, 2014 Mae Lao earthquake. In total, about 26,551 survey building data have been investigated by authorities and engineers. The typical pattern of observed damage for different structures and the reasons for damage are presented. In addition, damage statistics in the field are correlated with ground motion in order to derive empirical seismic fragility curves. Using a maximum likelihood method, different sets of fragility curves are developed to demonstrate the influence of structural material on building damage level. The good correlation between observed damage and peak ground acceleration (PGA) are observed. In addition, the results show a better seismic performance of the engineered reinforced concrete building over non-engineered buildings.

12878,"School facilities in Iran, in particular masonry schools, have shown poor performance during past earthquakes and can be identified as one of the parts of the country’s infrastructure that is most vulnerable to earthquakes. Hence, in this paper a method to perform index-based damage assessment for brick masonry schools located in the province of Yazd, the central region of Iran, using a comprehensive database of school buildings, is proposed. The database was obtained from the field survey forms applied for each observed school to collect the features of and damage to the structure. The results of a vulnerability index method developed in Iran are employed as input data to obtain empirical fragility curves for the school inventory. The Macroseismic model and GNDT II level method are two empirical methods combined in this procedure. Finally, the procedure is verified using damage survey data obtained after recent earthquakes (1990 Manjil–Rudbar earthquake and 2003 Bam earthquake) that occurred in Iran. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Empirical seismic vulnerability analysis for masonry buildings based on school buildings survey in Iran,2016,Damage factor  Fragility curves  Iran  Masonry schools  Vulnerability assessment  Vulnerability index,Developing countries  Earthquakes  Geophysics  Masonry materials  School buildings  Societies and institutions  Surveys  Damage factor  Fragility curves  Iran  Masonry schools  Vulnerability assessments  Vulnerability index  Damage detection  Bam earthquake 2003  damage  empirical analysis  field survey  hazard assessment  index method  masonry  numerical model  seismic method  vulnerability  Iran  Yazd,1,1
12882,"Following a series of deadly tornadoes between 2011 and 2013, this paper develops a numerical tool to help communities better predict and quantify the potential tornado damage to single-family residential structures from a tornado strike. The objective is to determine the predictive capability of an engineering-based tornado damage-assessment (ETDA) Tool using published building damage observations captured by the authors in a recent tornado. The research is motivated by the need for the public to visualize the extent of tornado vulnerabilities of residential buildings in our communities. The research developed a numerical estimation model to aggregate damage that a specified tornado would cause to the residential wood-framed structures in a community. The ETDA Tool was developed around a Monte Carlo simulation engine, using theoretical models for tornado wind velocity and pressure drop in the tornado vortex, as well as experimentally-determined probability distribution functions for the structural resistances of eight building component systems selected to describe the structure. The output of the EDTA Tool is presented as series of mean damage ratios, and other statistics quantifying tornado-damage caused, plotted against distance away from the tornado vortex centerline. The paper explains the methodology of the approach and presents results comparing hindcast damage ratios against observed values of field-observations collected after a tornado strike on residential communities in Garland/Rowlett, TX. It was found the ETDA Tool provides reasonable agreement with the field damage observations to houses. The Tool could be used by a community to model any tornado path and/or size and estimate future damage. More research to further our understanding of tornado-induced wind loads and wind-borne debris effects is needed to increase confidence in its application to any tornado and any city. © Copyright © 2020 Jain, Bhusar, Roueche and Prevatt.",Engineering-Based Tornado Damage Assessment: Numerical Tool for Assessing Tornado Vulnerability of Residential Structures,2020,damage  Monte - Carlo simulation  residential  structural load paths  tornado  wind engineering  wind load,None,1,1
12905,"The Tehran metropolitan area is extremely vulnerable to earthquakes due to the location of its active faults and its dense population. Assessing the probable damage of a high magnitude earthquake on buildings and facilities relies on a precise structural survey, which has an empirical basis depending on historic ground motions. The probability of damage and failure in discrete limits based on different ground motions is estimated by fragility curves. Using the most matching fragility curves for buildings in Tehran, the vulnerability of the hospitals in the capital, as one of the most critical structures in crisis management of disasters, was investigated in this study. Subsequently, the existing fragility curves, developed for Tehran and the other seismic prone countries such as Japan and the United States, were compared considering the typology of Tehran’s hospitals. Finally, the possible damages for each hospital were calculated based on the most conservative fragility curve and the most pessimistic scenario, which were used to evaluate the seismic vulnerability of hospitals and health care systems for different damage states. After zoning the damage of therapeutic areas of Tehran, it was observed that at least 2% to 10% damage occurred in all hospitals of Tehran, and none of the healthcare centers would remain structurally undamaged after a strong earthquake with the moment magnitude of 7 or more. In addition, the healthcare buildings could be prone to significant structural damage, especially in southern parts, which necessitates proactive management plans for Tehran metropolitan area. © 2021 by the authors.

12925,"The knowledge about potential flood damage is a key issue for disaster risk reduction. However, the scarcity of empirical data has limited flood damage modeling in several regions. As a result, studies in data-scarce regions have mostly been restricted to either building exposure assessment or identification of vulnerability indicators without a further linkage to probable damage. As expert-based approaches do not require empirical damage data, they have a high potential for flood damage modeling in data-scarce regions. In this study, we carried out a comparative assessment between an expert-based and a data-driven approach. The expert-based approach systematically combines the vulnerability indicator method and synthetic what-if analysis based on the knowledge of regional experts. The data-driven approach integrates empirical flood damage data in the analysis applying a multivariate random forest model. Flood damage data, collected through interviews after two flood events in 2017 and 2019 at separate locations in Nigeria, were used to evaluate the performance of both methods based on developed damage grades. Results from both methods showed i) a predictive accuracy of 30% and 38% for the expert-based and data-driven approaches respectively, ii) that distance to channel, wall material, building condition, and building quality are significant regional damage drivers, and iii) comparable model performance can be achieved even with a reduced number of variables. Furthermore, the study demonstrated how experts are likely to underestimate damage at low water depths and how a difference in conformity to building standards can add to challenges in flood damage prediction. © 2021 The Author(s)",Expert-based versus data-driven flood damage models: A comparative evaluation for data-scarce regions,2021,Damage grades  Damage prediction  Data-driven  Data-scarce  Expert-based  Flood,None,1,1
12936,"This paper proposes a novel methodology for developing fire fragility functions for an entire steel building - meaning that the function is not specific to a location within the building. The aim is to characterize the probabilistic vulnerability of steel buildings to fire in the context of community resilience assessment. In developing the fragility functions, uncertainties in the fire model, the heat transfer model and the thermo-mechanical response are considered. In addition several fire scenarios at different locations in the building are studied. Monte Carlo Simulations and Latin Hypercube Sampling are used to generate the probability distributions of demand placed on the members and structural capacity relative to selected damage thresholds. By assessing demand and capacity in the temperature domain, the thermal and the structural problems can be treated separately to improve the efficiency of the probabilistic analysis. After the probability distributions are obtained for demand and capacity, the fragility functions can be obtained by convolution of the distributions. Finally, event tree analysis is used to combine the functions associated with fire scenarios in different building locations. The developed fire fragility functions yield the probability of exceedance of predefined damage states as a function of the fire load in the building. The methodology is illustrated on an example consisting in a prototype nine-story steel building based on the SAC project. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Fire fragility curves for steel buildings in a community context: A methodology,2016,Community risk assessment  Fire  Fragility analysis  Steel building  Structural reliability  Urban resilience,Buildings  Fires  Heat transfer  Intelligent systems  Location  Monte Carlo methods  Probability  Reliability analysis  Risk assessment  Structural analysis  Community risk assessments  Fragility analysis  Steel buildings  Structural reliability  Urban resilience  Probability distributions  fire  Monte Carlo analysis  multistorey building  numerical model  reliability analysis  resilience  risk assessment  steel  structural analysis,0,1
12942,"Flood damage modelling is becoming an essential component in flood risk management. However damage assessments are affected by large uncertainty, mainly related to the use of depth–damage functions. In some countries, where no site-specific curves are available, a transfer of damage models developed from other areas is required, adding extra uncertainty in the modelling process. This paper discusses the transferability in space of damage curves from literature, with a focus on ‘function uncertainty’, pointing out, especially for mesoscale ones, the lack of detailed information in terms of flood and/or building characteristics that can allow to identify the conditions of applicability of the models. New site-specific depth–damage functions are then developed for the residential sector, at meso- and microscale, based on damage data from the 2010 flood in Veneto, Italy. The application of the new curves reveals a better performance of the mesoscale model compared with the more detailed microscale one, probably due to the small extent of the inundated area. © 2015 The Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management (CIWEM) and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Flood damage curves: new insights from the 2010 flood in Veneto, Italy",2017,depth–damage curves  flood damage assessment  Italy  mesoscale analysis  microscale analysis  uncertainty  validation  vulnerability,flood control  flood damage  literature review  mesoscale eddy  performance assessment  residential location  risk assessment  uncertainty analysis  vulnerability  Italy  Veneto,1,1
12946,"This paper presents a probabilistic approach for flood risk assessment in a reach of the Richelieu River, south of Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu, Quebec, Canada. The approach is based on a combination of three simple modules: 1) flood frequency analysis (frequency and peak discharge), 2) estimation of inundation depth, and 3) damage and loss estimation. To assess the flood negative impacts, a simple hydraulic model is developed designed to replace and complement the existing 2D model coupled to an existing damage model. By simplifying the spatial coverage of flood calculations, this approach accelerates the computational efficiency enabling a broader set of elements to be combined in a large sample of Monte Carlo simulations applied in the flood risk assessment. The final result is a local scale risk map indicating the expected annual damage to each individual building in the study area useful for flood risk decision making. The analyses show that the approach is particularly powerful for flood risk assessments in areas adjacent to the river for which sufficient data is available. © 2018","Flood risk mapping for direct damage to residential buildings in Quebec, Canada",2019,2D model  Decision making  Expected annual damage  Flood risk  Monte Carlo,None,1,1
12949,"In seismic reliability analysis the total failure probability is determined by combining the fragility curve – representing the response of the structure to seismic excitation – with the seismic hazard curve. The determination of fragility curves has a long tradition in the nuclear industry and reaches back to the 1970s. Since the late 1990s also for ordinary buildings seismic reliability analysis became more important and formed the bases for the development of new seismic standards. Several methods are available to build fragility curves. They are relying on different assumptions and restrictions, as well as levels of detail. In this paper, different fragility analysis methods are described and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed: (i) the safety factor method, in which the fragility curve is estimated based on safety margins with respect on an existing deterministic design; the numerical simulation method, in which the parameters of the fragility curve are obtained by (ii) regression analysis or (iii) maximum likelihood estimation from a set of nonlinear time history analysis at different seismic levels; (iv) the incremental dynamic analysis method where a set of accelerograms is scaled until failure. These four fragility analysis methods are applied to determine fragility curves for the 3-storey reinforced concrete shear wall building of the SMART2013 benchmark project. Advantages and disadvantages of the methods are illustrated and the impact of the simplifying assumptions (e.g. lognormal curves, scaling) are assessed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Fragility analysis methods: Review of existing approaches and application,2017,None,Maximum likelihood  Maximum likelihood estimation  Nuclear industry  Numerical methods  Regression analysis  Reinforced concrete  Safety factor  Seismic design  Seismology  Shear walls  Deterministic design  Incremental dynamic analysis  Nonlinear time history analysis  Numerical simulation method  Reinforced concrete shear walls  Safety factor methods  Seismic excitations  Simplifying assumptions  Reliability analysis,1,1
12951,"The purpose of this study is to develop the fragility curve associated with a real building. An approach to estimate seismic fragility without the need to perform the nonlinear dynamic analysis for determining the damage state of the structure as well as without the need to perform the Monte Carlo simulation for calculating the damage probability with respect to ground motion of different intensities is developed here. The capacity spectrum method is modified to determine the damage state of the target building. Consequently, nonlinear push over analysis is performed to obtain the capacity curve of the building and the damage states of the structure can then be determined by using the performance curve derived from capacity curve and code spectrum associated with ground motion within certain range of peak ground acceleration (PGA) values. Fragility curves in this study are assumed to be lognormal distribution described by two parameters and are developed as a function of PGA. The estimation of these two parameters is done by the maximum likelihood method treating each event of damage as a realization from a Bernoulli experiment. In fact, genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to obtain the parameters. The uncertainty associated with the ground motion is simulated by analyzing the statistical characteristics of the records of ground motion collected near the site. In addition, the uncertainties associated with the capacity spectrum and the thresholds of different damage states are also analyzed. Finally, fragility curves considering different level of uncertainties are constructed and compared for target building.

12959,"Current guidelines for design and assessment of buildings under tsunami actions do not explicitly state how to apply tsunami loads to buildings and which analysis methods to use in order to assess the structural response to the tsunami loads. In this paper, a reinforced concrete (RC) moment-resisting frame, which is designed as a tsunami evacuation building, is selected as a case study and subjected to simulated 2011 Tohoku tsunami waves. To assess tsunami impact on the model building, different nonlinear static analyses, i.e. constant-height pushover (CHPO) and variable-height pushover (VHPO), are compared with nonlinear dynamic analysis. The results of VHPO provide a good prediction of engineering demand parameters and collapse fragility curves obtained from the dynamic analysis under a wide range of tsunami loading. On the other hand, CHPO tends to overestimate interstorey drift ratio (IDR) and underestimate column shear by about 5–20%. It provides a larger fragility, i.e. about 10% in median value, for global failure and a smaller fragility for local shear failure. On the basis of these results, it is recommended that VHPO be used in future fragility analysis of buildings subjected to tsunami. However, pushover methods might not be adequate in cases where the tsunami inundation force time-histories are characterised by a “double-peak”, which subjects the structure to a two-cycle load. Finally, it is found that tsunami peak force is better correlated to IDR than flow velocity and inundation depth for the considered structure. This suggests that the peak force would be a more efficient intensity measure than the other two in the development of tsunami fragility curves. © 2017 The Authors",Fragility assessment of a RC structure under tsunami actions via nonlinear static and dynamic analyses,2017,Analysis methodology  Fragility curve  Pushover analysis  Time-history analysis  Tsunami engineering  Tsunami force  Tsunami simulation,Buildings  Dynamic analysis  Floods  Flow velocity  Nonlinear analysis  Reinforced concrete  Tsunamis  Analysis methodology  Fragility curves  Push-over analysis  Time history analysis  Tsunami forces  Tsunami simulation  Structural design  computer simulation  concrete structure  dynamic analysis  reinforced concrete  tsunami,1,1
12963,"The 2003 earthquake in the Greek island of Lefkas, has revived the interest for the local anti-seismic technique based on the use of timber-framed masonry, whose adequate performance during the earthquake revealed the merits of this rather sophisticated, albeit traditional, construction. A key feature of the Lefkas structures is their dual structural system. The secondary system is activated once the ground storey stone masonry piers of the primary system (which includes timber-framed masonry in all storeys) fail. In this regard, two different structural models are presented herein to simulate the response of each system. A macro-model based on nonlinear (NL) strut elements and point plastic hinges is intended to model the timber-framed masonry. NL analyses are carried out for one, two and three storey buildings, which represent the most common cases in Lefkas. Furthermore, an investigation is carried out regarding the foundation of the buildings resting on soft alluvial deposits. Pushover curves are derived from the NL analyses of the buildings and are then converted to capacity curves using the characteristics of the predominant mode. On these curves four damage states (slight damage, moderate damage, heavy damage, and collapse) are defined on the basis of criteria related to the actual response of the building. Then, fragility curves in terms of spectral displacement are generated, adopting a log-normal statistical distribution. These curves are converted into PGA values using a selected response spectrum. Utilising these fragility curves a seismic loss scenario for the 2003 Lefkas earthquake is developed for the timber-framed masonry stock of Lefkas city. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Fragility curves and loss estimation for traditional timber-framed masonry buildings in Lefkas, Greece",2015,Capacity curves  Fragility curves in terms of PGA  Fragility curves in terms of Sd  Lefkas traditional buildings  Loss assessment  Timber-framed masonry buildings,None,1,1
12966,"The 63,605 damaged buildings from the 2011 Tohoku-oki tsunami in Ishinomaki were used to develop 52 fragility curves using linear regression. The data comprise the damage level and the measured inundation depth for each building. In agreement with previous studies, the present results indicate that reinforced concrete and steel buildings with three stories or more perform better under tsunami loading. Performance with respect to their intended function was found to depend mainly on structural material. Moreover, based on Japan's design code for earthquake-resistant buildings, buildings constructed after 1981 do not display a better performance compared to more recent constructions. Finally, the results show that for the same inundation depth, a higher damage probability exists along a ria coast due to higher flow velocities, confirmed by numerical simulation and survivor videos. These new findings are useful for building damage assessment, town reconstruction, and comparison of vulnerability functions in future studies. © 2015, Earthquake Engineering Research Institute.","Fragility curves based on data from the 2011 Tohoku-oki Tsunami in Ishinomaki City, with discussion of parameters influencing building damage",2015,None,Damage detection  Earthquake engineering  Floods  Reinforced concrete  Tsunamis  Building damage  Damage level  Damage probability  Design codes  Earthquake-resistant buildings  Fragility curves  Steel buildings  Tohoku-oki tsunamis  Buildings  architectural design  dynamic response  earthquake damage  linearity  performance assessment  reinforced concrete  seismic design  seismic response  structural response  Tohoku earthquake 2011  vulnerability  Honshu  Ishinomaki  Japan  Miyagi  Tohoku,1,1
12967,"A series of earthquakes hit Kumamoto Prefecture in Kyushu Island, Japan, on April 14 and 16, 2016. A large number of buildings, mostly wooden houses, were damaged. This study developed fragility curves of buildings using the damage survey data provided by the Uki City government. The damage ratios of buildings were investigated from the viewpoints of the structural material and the construction period. As the result, the damage ratio of wooden buildings was found to be larger than those of other structural materials, and the damage ratios of major, moderate+, and moderate- got smaller as the construction period became newer. Empirical fragility curves of buildings for Uki City were constructed based on the damage survey data and the estimated peak ground velocity (PGV). Compared with the result of the previous study for Mashiki Town due the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, the major damage ratios of wooden buildings for Uki City was shown in a lower level than those for Mashiki Town in the same PGV. The fragility curves for Uki City were obtained using the damage survey data in the smaller PGV range than that for Mashiki Town, thus the regression results reflected the damage trend in the small PGVs. The fragility curves for Uki City and Mashiki Town due the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake were compared with those for Nishinomiya City and Nada Ward due the 1995 Kobe earthquake.

12968,"A hybrid seismic fragility model for territorial-scale seismic vulnerability assessment of masonry buildings is developed and presented in this paper. The method combines expert-judgment and mechanical approaches to derive typological fragility curves for Italian residential masonry building stock. The first classifies Italian masonry buildings in five different typological classes as function of age of construction, structural typology, and seismic behaviour and damaging of buildings observed following the most severe earthquakes occurred in Italy. The second, based on numerical analyses results conducted on building prototypes, provides all the parameters necessary for developing fragility functions. Peak-Ground Acceleration (PGA) at Ultimate Limit State attainable by each building’s class has been chosen as an Intensity Measure to represent fragility curves: three types of curve have been developed, each referred to mean, maximum and minimum value of PGAs defined for each building class. To represent the expected damage scenario for increasing earthquake intensities, a correlation between PGAs and Mercalli-Cancani-Sieber macroseismic intensity scale has been used and the corresponding fragility curves developed. Results show that the proposed building’s classes are representative of the Italian masonry building stock and that fragility curves are effective for predicting both seismic vulnerability and expected damage scenarios for seismic-prone areas. Finally, the fragility curves have been compared with empirical curves obtained through a macroseismic approach on Italian masonry buildings available in literature, underlining the differences between the methods. © 2021, The Author(s).",Fragility curves for Italian URM buildings based on a hybrid method,2021,Fragility curves  Hybrid method  Territorial-scale  Typological classification  URM buildings,Earthquakes  Masonry construction  Masonry materials  Seismic response  Building prototypes  Earthquake intensity  Fragility function  Macroseismic intensity  Peak ground acceleration  Seismic vulnerability  Structural typologies  Ultimate limit state  Buildings  damage mechanics  detection method  earthquake damage  earthquake event  masonry  vulnerability  Italy,1,1

12972,"Malawi is located within the southern branch of the active East African Rift System, where earthquakes of moment magnitude (Mw) 7.0 or greater can occur along major faults. The majority of dwellings in the country are non-engineered unreinforced masonry constructions, built by local artisans with little input from engineers. These constructions are highly vulnerable to seismic events due to poor-quality materials and lack of construction detailing. This study presents a new methodology to assess the seismic fragility curves of typical dwellings located in the Central and Southern Malawi. On-site inspections of buildings are carried out to assess geometrical and structural features of 646 façades, and an experimental campaign is performed to characterise the mechanical properties of local construction materials. The collected data allow the identification of different building typologies in terms of quality of materials and construction techniques. The critical failure modes for each of the inspected façade at their ultimate limit state are evaluated analytically. Damage limit states are defined and adopted to derive simplified Static Push-Over (SPO) curves, transformed into incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) curves by using SPO2IDA. The IDA curves are then used to obtain fragility curves for the specific damage limit states. The fragility curves presented herein are the first to be calculated for these building typologies, based on local data, and unfortunately, they show that buildings in Malawi are far more vulnerable to earthquakes than estimated from previously available international reference data. The fragility curves developed in this study may prove useful for assessing the seismic risk of these building typologies in Malawi and other East African countries. © 2021, The Author(s).",Fragility curves for non-engineered masonry buildings in developing countries derived from real data based on structural surveys and laboratory tests,2021,Fragility curves  Laboratory testing  Mechanical approach  Non-engineered unreinforced masonry buildings  SPO2IDA  Structural survey,Developing countries  Housing  Masonry construction  Masonry materials  Risk assessment  Building typologies  Construction technique  Experimental campaign  Incremental dynamic analysis  Quality of materials  Seismic fragility curves  Structural surveys  Ultimate limit state  Earthquakes,1,1

In this paper, the structures at the toe of slopes subjected to the impact of landslides were considered. A probabilistic procedure developed in another paper is applied to two-story reinforced concrete building without infill walls. A method to evaluate cumulative damage to structures due to earthquake shaking and landslide impact was implemented through MATLAB. The variability in landslide-related loading, in terms of extension in plan and impact angle, was considered. A 2D frame was taken out from a 3D model and sequential response analysis was carried out on both models through OpenSees. Uncertainties were modelled through probability distributions of primary variables that mostly influence structural response, allowing the derivation of fragility curves via simulation. The probability of collapse was investigated under varying peak ground acceleration and impact velocity, which were considered as intensity measures for earthquake shaking and landslide impact, respectively. © 2020 European Association for Structural Dynamics.

12980,"Susceptibility to structural damage can be characterized by a fragility curve, which is expressed as a normal or lognormal cumulative distribution of the conditional probabilities of reaching or exceeding a particular damage state, for given values of the demand parameter. Such curves have been produced for a variety of damage states in different categories of buildings exposed to tsunami loading in different parts of the world, with the demand parameter taken as inundation depth. Harmonization was sought across these studies with respect to the median inundation depth. Three categories of single-storey buildings were identified based on construction material, namely reinforced concrete, masonry and timber. The median inundation depths for the complete damage state decreased from reinforced concrete (5.4–7.3 m) through masonry (2.3–2.5 m) to timber (~1.6 m) structures. The fairly narrow ranges above represent a number of different studies and indicate that a common family of curves or “bands” can be arrived at. Such ranges were identified for other partial damage states too. Our genuinely original contribution is a probabilistic model that was developed using a Monte Carlo simulation to produce synthetic fragility functions for masonry and reinforced concrete structures under tsunami loading. The probabilistic model consisted of a geometric model that captured the geometrical and wall-type variations of the building lot, a loading function and a set of failure criteria, all of which required appropriate simplifying assumptions. The resulting synthetic fragility curves matched the fragility curves based on observed tsunami damage for the complete collapse damage state reasonably well. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Fragility curves for structures under tsunami loading,2016,Construction material  Damage state  Failure criterion  Fragility curves  Inundation depth  Monte Carlo simulation,failure analysis  loading  Monte Carlo analysis  numerical model  probability  reinforced concrete  structural analysis  tsunami,1,1

A revised set of fragility curves has also been prepared in which the bias in the curve resulting from the uncertainty in the ground motion parameter has been removed. The uncertainty in the fragility curves is evaluated and discussed and the curves are compared with those from other studies.

12994,"Despite realizing the importance of risk-based frameworks in fire engineering, current fire safety guidelines are largely prescriptive and over-conservative in nature, which do not consider the effect of uncertainties influencing the fire resistance of the structural systems. In this context, a probabilistic framework is presented to investigate vulnerability of a reinforced concrete (RC) portal frame subjected to fire. Here, a three-dimensional (3-D) nonlinear finite element (FE) model for the RC portal frame exposed to elevated temperature is developed, and transient thermo-mechanical analysis is carried out by duly incorporating temperature variation of thermal and mechanical properties of concrete and steel rebar. Probabilistic study is conducted by developing fragility curves based on limit state of deflection to quantify the vulnerability of the structural members exposed to fire loading. Parametric studies are conducted by varying the material properties of the RC portal frame to investigate the influence of uncertainties in the fire loading on its structural performance and fragility. The failure probability starts at a higher fire load density (450 MJ/m(2)) for the structure with higher concrete grade as compared to the relatively lower fire load density (200 MJ/m(2)) for lower grade. Therefore, the fire resistance of the RC structures has been recommended to be based on the strength of the member, rather than merely sizes of the members. The proposed stochastic analysis framework, thereby, provides a rational approach to improve the performance based fire design of RC structures at member and structure levels by identifying the parameters affecting the structural fire resistance.",Framework for fragility assessment of reinforced concrete portal frame subjected to elevated temperature,2020,Concrete  Fire  Fragility  Stochastic  Thermal  Vulnerability,HIGH-STRENGTH CONCRETE  FIRE SAFETY  RELIABILITY-ANALYSIS  NUMERICAL-ANALYSIS  STEEL COLUMNS  BEAMS  PERFORMANCE  BUILDINGS  BEHAVIOR  DESIGN,0,1
13007,"Physical vulnerability of buildings is one of the key parameters needed to assess earthquake risk and to address appropriate disaster management interventions in earthquake prone countries. In order to evaluate this parameter, appropriate fragility functions prepared based on local construction should be applied. However, in Iran reliable fragility curves for different types of buildings have not been developed yet. To address this issue, 19 sets of fragility curves for different types of buildings of Iran were generated in this study, based on empirical approach, incorporated with statistical analysis. Accordingly, at first, different types of common buildings in Iran such as steel frame, reinforced concrete, and masonry buildings were classified into 19 categories. Then, appropriate fragility curves were generated for each class, using existing empirical fragility curves in Iran as well as those proposed for similar types of buildings in other countries. For this purpose, a statistical approach was adopted to weight different curves based on the construction provisions and expert’s judgment. Finally, fragility curves obtained from this study were validated with the observed damages of the previous earthquakes in Iran that shows acceptable compatibility. The proposed approach provides more reliable results for vulnerability assessments in Iran and can be employed in other regions having similar conditions. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Generation of new fragility curves for common types of buildings in Iran,2020,Fragility curve  Iranian buildings  Seismic risk  Vulnerability,Disaster prevention  Disasters  Earthquakes  Reinforced concrete  Risk assessment  Disaster management  Empirical approach  Fragility curves  Iranian buildings  Seismic risk  Statistical approach  Vulnerability  Vulnerability assessments  Buildings  building  disaster management  earthquake engineering  earthquake event  empirical analysis  failure mechanism  masonry  reinforced concrete  vulnerability  Iran,1,1
13093,"Conventional seismic performance evaluation methods for building structures with soil– structure interaction effects are inefficient for regional seismic damage assessment as a predisaster management system. Therefore, this study presented the framework to develop an artificial neural network-based model, which can rapidly predict seismic responses with soil–structure interaction effects and determine the seismic performance levels. To train, validate and test the model, 11 input parameters were selected as main parameters, and the seismic responses with the soil–structure interaction were generated using a multistep analysis process proposed in this study. The artificial neural network model generated reliable seismic responses with the soil–structure interaction effects, and it rapidly extended the seismic response database using a simple structure and soil information. This data generation method with high accuracy and speed can be utilized as a regional seismic assessment tool for safe and sustainable structures against natural disasters. © 2021 by the authors.

13094,"Steel frames equipped with buckling restrained braces (BRBs) have been increasingly applied in earthquake-prone areas given their excellent capacity for resisting lateral forces. Therefore, special attention has been paid to the seismic risk assessment (SRA) of such structures, e.g., seismic fragility analysis. Conventional approaches, e.g., nonlinear finite element simulation (NFES), are computationally inefficient for SRA analysis particularly for large-scale steel BRB frame structures. In this study, amachine learning (ML)-based seismic fragility analysis framework is established to effectively assess the risk to structures under seismic loading conditions. An optimal artificial neural network model can be trained using calculated damage and intensity measures, a technique which will be used to compute the fragility curves of a steel BRB frame instead of employing NFES.

13104,"Seismic risk assessment at the territorial level is now widely recognised as essential for countries with intense seismic activity, such as Italy. Academia is called to give its contribution in order to synergically deepen the knowledge about the various components of this risk, starting from the complex evaluation of vulnerability of the built heritage. In line with this, a mechanics-based seismic fragility model for Italian residential masonry buildings was developed and presented in this paper. This model is based on the classification of the building stock in macro-typologies, defined by age of construction and number of storeys, which being information available at national level, allow simulating damage scenarios and carrying out risk analyses on a territorial scale. The model is developed on the fragility of over 500 buildings, sampled according to national representativeness criteria and analysed through the Vulnus_4.0 software. The calculated fragility functions were extended on the basis of a reference model available in the literature, which provides generic fragilities for the EMS98 vulnerability classes, thus obtaining a fragility model defined on the five EMS98 damage states. Lastly, to assess the reliability of the proposed model, this was used to simulate damage scenarios due to the 2009 L’Aquila earthquake. Overall, the comparison between model results and observed damage showed a good fit, proving the model effectiveness. © 2020, The Author(s).",Mechanics-based fragility curves for Italian residential URM buildings,2021,Fragility model  Macro-typologies  Residential masonry buildings  Seismic damage scenarios  Seismic risk management  Territorial-scale seismic vulnerability,Classification (of information)  Earthquakes  Housing  Risk analysis  Risk perception  Complex evaluations  Fragility function  Masonry building  Number of storeys  Reference modeling  Seismic activity  Seismic fragility  Seismic risk assessment  Risk assessment  building  classification  complexity  damage mechanics  residential location  risk assessment  software  typology  vulnerability  Italy  Aquila,1,1
13105,"Purpose Despite recognizing the significance of risk-based frameworks in fire safety engineering, the usual approach in structural fire design is largely member/component level, wherein effect of uncertainties influencing the fire resistance of structures are not explicitly considered. In this context, a probabilistic framework is presented to investigate the vulnerability of a reinforced concrete (RC) members and structure under fire loading scenario. Design/methodology/approach The RC structures exposed to fire are modeled in a finite element (FE) platform incorporating material and geometric nonlinearity, in which the transient thermo-mechanical analysis is carried out by suitably incorporating the temperature variation of thermal and mechanical properties of both concrete and steel rebar. The stochasticity in the system is considered in structural resistance, thermal and fire model parameters, and the subsequent fragility curves are developed considering threshold limit state of deflection. Findings The fire resistance of RC structure is reported to be significantly lower in comparison to the RC members, thereby illustrating the current prescriptive design approaches based on studies of structural member behavior to be crucial from a safety and reliability point of view. Practical implications The framework developed for the vulnerability assessment of RC structures under fire hazard through FE analysis can be effectively used to estimate the structural fire resistance for other similar structure to enhance safety and reliability of structures under such extreme threats. Originality/value The paper proposes a novel methodology for vulnerability assessment of three-dimensional RC structures under fire hazard through FE analysis and provides comparison of the structural fragility with fragility developed for structural members. Moreover, the research emphasizes to assume 3D behavior of the structure rather than the approximate 2D behavior.",Member and structural fragility of reinforced concrete structure under fire,2020,Vulnerability  Concrete  Fire  Fragility  Thermal  Stochastic,HIGH-STRENGTH CONCRETE  RELIABILITY-ANALYSIS  SEISMIC FRAGILITY  STORAGE TANKS  BEAMS  DESIGN  UNCERTAINTY  RESISTANCE  BUILDINGS  SAFETY,0,1
13111,"Current flood vulnerability analyses rely on deterministic methods (e.g., stage-damage functions) to quantify resulting damage and losses to the built environment. While such approaches have been used extensively by communities, they do not enable the propagation of uncertainty into a risk- or resilience-informed decision process. In this paper, a method that allows the development of building fragility and building loss functions is articulated and applied to develop an archetype portfolio that can be used to model buildings in a typical community. The typical single-variable flood vulnerability function, normally based on flood depth, is extended to a multi-variate flood vulnerability function, which is a function of both flood depth and flood duration, thereby creating fragility surfaces. The portfolio presented herein consists of 15 building archetypes that can serve to populate a community-level model to predict damage and resulting functionality from a scenario flood event. The prediction of damage and functionality of buildings within a community is the first step in developing risk-informed mitigation decisions to improve community resilience.",Minimal Building Flood Fragility and Loss Function Portfolio for Resilience Analysis at the Community Level,2020,flood risk  flood damage  flood fragility  flood loss  community resilience  multi-variate analysis,RISK-ASSESSMENT  RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS  DAMAGE ASSESSMENT  UNCERTAINTY  MODEL  METHODOLOGY,1,1
13112,"Tornadoes are considered a low-probability high-consequence event that can cause significant damage to community infrastructure, resulting in injuries and fatalities and ultimately creating long-term socioeconomic losses. Community resilience requires not only that the performance level of individual facilities be modeled and understood, but also their synthesis in space and time. Fragilities are conditional statistical distributions that provide the probability of exceeding analyst-defined performance levels as a function of hazard (or loading) intensity. Fragilities are becoming a core component in community resilience studies and enable the analyst to model performance of individual components or a cluster of the infrastructure, thereby supporting risk-informed decision making at the community level. In this paper, tornado fragilities for a portfolio of nonresidential buildings are developed. These fragilities, combined with several existing tornado building fragilities from the literature, are proposed to represent a first comprehensive minimum size portfolio of tornado building fragilities needed to model a community. For illustration, they are then used in the Centerville virtual community to perform community-level building damage assessment. This minimal-level portfolio of building fragilities lays the foundation for post-tornado recovery and resilience studies of a community, which eventually requires inclusion of all physical and nonphysical infrastructure. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Minimal Building Fragility Portfolio for Damage Assessment of Communities Subjected to Tornadoes,2018,Building portfolio  Centerville virtual community  Community resilience  Spatial building damage  Tornado  Tornado fragility,Buildings  Decision making  Probability distributions  Social networking (online)  Tornadoes  Virtual reality  Building damage  Community resiliences  Damage assessments  Individual components  Nonresidential buildings  Risk-informed decision making  Statistical distribution  Virtual community  Damage detection,1,1
13122,"Performing probabilistic damage assessment for a community under a tropical cyclone event needs to consider the collective damage of individual structures within the community, which involves modeling the spatial correlations of hazard demands and structural capacities between individual structures. However, how to model these two kinds of spatial correlations and how they influence the damage assessment remain unclear. In this paper, focus is given to the roof sheathing damage of a residential building portfolio consisting of multiple wooden residential buildings under the wind loads of a tropical cyclone event. Two methods are used to predict the damage of individual buildings based on their hazard demands: one is using a direct Monte Carlo Simulation in which structural (capacity) parameters of different buildings are treated as correlated. This method provides accurate results but needs a lot of information. Another approach is to probabilistically predict the damage state of each building based on its hazard demand using its fragility functions. The relative importance of the correlations of hazard demands and structural capacities is investigated. It is demonstrated that the correlations of damage states are strongly dependent on hazard demands. Finally, a method is developed to simulate correlated damage states of a building portfolio given hazard demands, through incorporating the hazard-dependent correlations with fragility functions using Gaussian Copula. © 13th International Conference on Applications of Statistics and Probability in Civil Engineering, ICASP 2019.

First, ground motion sequences together with building attribute data are adopted as inputs of the proposed MI-CNN model.

The overall prediction accuracy is 79.7%, and the prediction accuracies for all scenarios are above 77%, indicating a good prediction performance of the proposed method.

13142,"Propagating uncertainties in flood damage models is a critical step towards a risk-informed decision methodology that is based on quantitative assessment. Flood-related data scarcity and the use of deterministic models present challenges when seeking to include uncertainties in flood damage modeling. In this paper, a single-variable and multi-variate component-based flood fragility method is proposed. The method uses expert-based data derived from online sources that are applied within a Monte Carlo framework to divide the building into independent components and then assigns these components to five predefined damage states that describe the building damage as a whole. Using a series of Monte Carlo simulations, uncertainties in flood depth and flood duration that result in each damage level for each component were propagated. Their damage is then characterized using component fragility functions to be used to develop total building fragility and loss functions. The resulting fragilities can be used as a probabilistic vulnerability function to be assigned to a real community based on building archetype and occupancy.

Summary of field observation is presented first and empirical fragility curves are developed from the detailed damage assessment data from 603 villages in central, eastern and western Nepal.

Two sets of fragility functions are derived using peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration at 0.3 s as the intensity measures. The sum of the results highlights that stone masonry buildings in Nepal are highly vulnerable even in the case of low to moderate ground shaking.

13208,"Scientific community showed particular interest in tsunami risk assessment in the last years due to several worldwide tsunami events where high damages and human casualties were recorded during post-event surveys. This paper investigates the behaviour of Italian coastal residential masonry buildings under tsunami loads. Main fragility curves available in literature are based on empirical databases and consequentially, the structural behaviour is strictly related to local building typologies of other countries. For masonry buildings, it is complex to predict global response due to high material inhomogeneity, especially in the case of regional scale analysis; a critical review on local mechanisms activation of masonry walls under tsunami loads is briefly performed. Therefore, local mechanisms activation for masonry walls are investigated depending on out-of-plane and in-plane mechanisms assuming flexural and shear failure. Structures designed for gravity or seismic loads are generated based on several building classes depending on number of storeys and age of construction. Monte Carlo analyses generated building models for each identified building class to simulate the behaviour of Italian masonry buildings. Preliminary analytical tsunami fragility curves are developed in order to assess the vulnerability of Italian coastal residential masonry buildings under tsunami loads.

13212,"Fragility curves are very useful in quantifying the physical and economic damage of buildings that have undergone an earthquake. This paper presents the development of analytical fragility curves representative of mid-rise residential structures built with reinforced concrete, taking into account the specific structural characteristics of Algerian buildings. The derivation of the analytical fragility curves is based on the capacity spectrum method (CSM), which combines a non-linear static analysis (pushover) with a response spectrum analysis. Observation of the consequences of earthquakes of a given intensity shows that the damage to buildings is not identical, even though their construction is similar. This variability of damage can be explained by the variability of a large number of factors such as the local intensity of the hazard, the heterogeneity of the terrain, and the mechanical and geometrical characteristics of the constructions. The materials and patterns of demand spectra were considered as random variables using the Latin Hypercube Sampling Technique. Most of the existing methods that model the damage to structures accept a log-normal distribution hypothesis, where the log-normal law is a model controlled by two parameters: its mean value and its standard deviation. To set these parameters, Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) are performed to generate 1000 samples. The resulting fragility curves following these analyses were applied to two real-life cases of buildings affected by the earthquake of Beni-Ilmane 2010 (Msila, Algeria), so as to assess the damage. © 2017 Materials and Energy Research Center.

13213,"The article presents a probabilistic criteria for the damage and loss assessment of buildings exposed to strong wind hazard. The criteria include the development of fragility curves, within the Federal Emergency Management Agency style, for appropriate damage states on a hotel building and contents due to the loss of nonstructural elements, like facades and the partial or total loss of contents because of water infiltration. The loss estimation includes loss components like the business interruption due to repairs/reconstruction work and, throughout a new estimation that considers mitigation measures to upgrade the building, it is shown that these measures reduce the loss in a significant level. The probabilistic description of wind-induced pressure on facades and windows resorts on the wind velocity distribution, and their resistances consider data and statistics from manufacturers. The calculation of failure probabilities makes use of Monte Carlo simulations for the considered modes: windows/façade anchorage failure, glass braking due to wind pressure and impact of airborne debris. The probabilistic distribution of rainfall, given the occurrence of a hurricane and the subsequent water infiltration, serves to assess damages on structures under strong wind hazard. A hotel building recently damaged by the hurricane Odile in Baja California Sur, México is used to illustrate the formulation.

13218,"The most common and internationally accepted method of assessing building damage due to flooding is through the application of a depth-damage curve (DDC). A DDC relates the percent damage or estimated economic loss to a buildings' structural integrity and/or contents directly to a given water level (depth). The DDC generally represents an average structure within a given building category, e.g. one-storey single-family residence. Given the great variability across any given structural category, the variation in building materials, construction quality across communities and the singular focus on depth for estimation of losses, it is important to communicate the uncertainty and potential variability of the expected losses in any assessment. In this paper, probabilistic depth-damage curves (PDDCs) are developed based on synthetically derived DDCs from communities in southern Ontario. The generated PDDCs are based on assumed loss thresholds for minor and major loss levels, as spent in Canadian dollars. The economic loss estimates obtained in this way and their likelihood of being exceeded at any given flood depth express more transparently the potential building losses.

Address Points used by emergency management personnel approximate the locations of buildings, and they are a common operating picture for emergency responders.

To varying degrees, these parcel data describe building characteristics of structures within the parcel. Address Point data with cadastral data offers the ability to rapidly develop building inventories for flood damage estimation. Flood damage forecasts can expedite recovery and improve short-term flood resilience. In this work the authors evaluate Flood Damage Wizard, a proposed open source platform independent methodology. Flood Damage Wizard uses point shapefile building information to estimate flood damage to buildings by finding the appropriate depth-damage function using fuzzy-text matching.

Under given resilience parameters values, a resilient system is able to recover and be strengthened within a defined recovery period; otherwise, it is a non-resilient system.

13285,"Analytical seismic scenario-based probabilistic fragility relations form the spine of earthquake risk assessment and mitigation of RC high-rise wall buildings. In this study, a framework is proposed to develop both rigorous (refined) and less-demanding (cheaper) fragility relations for such structures. Multi-record incremental dynamic analysis is employed using a new scalar intensity measure and net inter-storey drift as a consistent global damage measure for varying heights of buildings. To illustrate the framework, a 30-storey wall building located in a multiple-scenario earthquake-prone region is analysed. The refined fragility sets are derived using 40 real earthquake records representing two seismic scenarios, while the proposed methodology to develop less-demanding seismic scenario-based fragility relations employs a considerably lower number of earthquake records. In this methodology, a new record selection criterion and a fragility curve tolerance factor are introduced. Finally, the two fragility relation sets for the reference structure are developed, assessed, and compared to provide insights into their features and accuracy. Using the proposed methodology, the study revealed that fairly reliable seismic scenario-based fragility sets can be developed for RC high-rise buildings with a significant reduction in computational time and efforts.

The average damage level suffered by each church was computed considering the global and local behaviors of the structures through a damage index computed as a weighted mean of the levels of damage observed for each mechanism. The results of this damage index method are used to obtain Probability Mass Functions and suitable probabilistic tools are used to propose Empirical Fragility Curves (EFCs) for these structures.

Primarily, it estimates damage index (DI) of reinforcement concrete (RC) framed low-rise residential buildings under the seismic ground motions. Three-dimensional DI has been estimated for a four-storey building by Park-Ang method considering irregularities. With increasing storey level, calculation of Park-Ang DI becomes tedious and more time consuming; therefore, this method is difficult to implement in large-scale damage evaluation. In this study, a simplified method has been proposed to estimate global DI (GDI) for regular and irregular buildings. It has been observed that ground floor experiences maximum damage where roof is experiencing least damage. Alternatively, an artificial neural network based prediction model has also been adopted in this paper to minimize the error. Factors affecting GDI of RC framed building has been narrated.

13346,"In Eastern Canada, most of moment resisting reinforced concrete frames with unreinforced masonry infill (MI-MRF) buildings were constructed between 1915 and 1960. These pre-code structures, in terms of seismic requirements, are considered vulnerable to earthquake loading. The goal of this study is to provide a simplified seismic demand and fragility analysis for reliable quantification of their seismic performance under potential future seismic events. Fragility functions represent the probability of damage that corresponds to a specific seismic intensity measure (e.g. peak ground acceleration). A case study three story-three bay MI-MRF was selected to illustrate the procedure. The selected frame was proportioned with compatible characteristics of existing mid-rise frames in Quebec region. A simplified probabilistic nonlinear static procedure was applied to obtain the seismic demand model at increasing levels of seismic intensity. Pushover analysis was conducted on a nonlinear model of the frame to obtain the corresponding lateral load-deformation capacity curve. Masonry infills were modelled as an equivalent diagonal struts and the nonlinear behaviour of the reinforced concrete beams and columns were modelled with concentrated plastic hinges at members' ends. Fragility functions were then developed using an experimental based damage model that correlate the extent of damage to the displacement demand. Damage assessment using the developed functions was conducted for an earthquake scenario compatible with the design level seismic hazard in Quebec City with a 2% probability of exceedance in 50% years. The developed functions are particularly useful in probabilistic based seismic loss assessment and in planning mitigation solutions. © (2015) by the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering All rights reserved.",Seismic fragility analysis of masonry infilled reinforced concrete frame buildings in Eastern Canada,2015,None,Beams and girders  Columns (structural)  Concrete beams and girders  Concretes  Damage detection  Earthquakes  Geophysics  Masonry materials  Nonlinear analysis  Reinforced concrete  Seismology  Structural design  Structural frames  Equivalent diagonal struts  Nonlinear static procedure  Probability of exceedance  Reinforced concrete beams  Reinforced concrete frame buildings  Reinforced concrete frames  Seismic fragility analysis  Seismic intensity measures  Seismic design,1,1
13357,"This research study was carried out to analyse the seismic behaviour of ten types of six-storey moment-resisting concrete frames, which were one regular frame and nine setback frames with different building configurations. In this analysis, the setback buildings were mainly studied because they have become increasingly popular in modern multi-storey building construction due to their functional and aesthetic architecture. Incremental dynamics analysis (IDA) was performed on these frames under three sets of repeated ground motion records. Based on the IDA curve, life safety (LS) performance level was considered as the main guideline to develop the fragility curves. The maximum inter-storey drift percentages at each storey level, for all frames and location of plastic hinges for each frame, were clearly determined through IDA. From the fragility curve results, the probability of reaching or exceeding the life safety performance state was determined. The regular frame showed the lowest probability as compared to other frames. Therefore, it is known that the building configuration of frames affects the building’s seismic performance, and thus it should be considered in the building’s seismic design. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Seismic fragility assessment for moment-resisting concrete frame with setback under repeated earthquakes,2019,Fragility curves  Incremental dynamic analysis  Irregular buildings  Regular buildings  Repeated earthquakes,None,1,1

The in-plane response of the corner unit is assessed through a 3D equivalent frame model of the entire aggregate, while the evaluation of its out-of-plane response makes use of the rigid-block assumption. Although evaluated in a separate way, the NDAs performed on the latter are based on the time histories derived from the global 3D model. The results are then processed in order to derive fragility curves, firstly, of the single failure mechanisms and, then, of the overall combined behavior. To this aim, various performance conditions are examined. For the reference building, the damage limit state is mainly governed by the in-plane behavior, while the collapse limit state by out-of-plane mechanisms. Moreover, the higher the connection level between adjacent structural units, the higher the interaction between in-plane and out-of-plane mechanisms at the collapse limit state.",Seismic fragility assessment of existing masonry buildings in aggregate,2021,Buildings in aggregate  Unreinforced masonry  Seismic assessment  Fragility curves  Non-linear dynamic analysis  Unit interactions  In-plane response  Out-of-plane mechanisms,PERFORMANCE-BASED ASSESSMENT  VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT  FLOOR SPECTRA  CENTERS  UNCERTAINTY  CAPACITY  STRENGTH  ABRUZZI  AREAS  MODEL,1,1
13366,"In this study, a simplified approach for the analytical development of fragility curves of high-rise RC buildings is presented. It is based on an approximate modal decomposition procedure known as the Uncoupled Modal Response History Analysis (UMRHA). Using an example of a 55-story case study building, the fragility relationships are developed using the presented approach. Fifteen earthquake ground motions (categorized into 3 groups corresponding to combinations of small or large magnitude and source-to-site distances) are considered for this example. These ground motion histories are scaled for 3 intensity measures (peak ground acceleration, spectral acceleration at 0.2 s and spectral acceleration at 1 s) varying from 0.25 to 2 g. The presented approach resulted in a significant reduction of computational time compared to the detailed Nonlinear Response History Analysis (NLRHA) procedure, and can be applied to assess the seismic vulnerability of complex-natured, higher mode-dominating tall reinforced concrete buildings. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.",Seismic fragility assessment of reinforced concrete high-rise buildings using the uncoupled modal response history analysis (UMRHA),2019,Fragility relationships  High-rise RC buildings  NLRHA  Seismic risk assessment  UMRHA,None,1,1
13373,"This study presents the steel fragility curves and performance curves of industrial buildings of different geometries. The fragility curves were obtained for different building geometries, and the performance curves were developed based on lateral load, which is affected by the geometry of the building. Three records of far-field ground motion were used for incremental dynamic analysis (IDA), and the design lateral loads for pushover analysis (POA). All designs were based on British Standard (BS 5950); however, Eurocode 8 was preferred for seismic consideration in the analysis because BS 5950 does not specify any seismic provision. The five levels of performance stated by FEMA-273, namely, operational phase, immediate occupancy, damage control, life safety, and collapse prevention (CP) were used as main guidelines for evaluating structural performance. For POA, Model 2 had highest base shear, followed by Model 1 and Model 3, even though Model 2 has a smaller structure compared with Model 3. Meanwhile, the fragility curves showed that the probability of reaching or exceeding the CP level of Model 2 is the highest, followed by that of Models 1 and 3. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.",Seismic Fragility Curves of Industrial Buildings by Using Nonlinear Analysis,2017,None,Buildings  Environmental engineering  Geometry  Nonlinear analysis  Office buildings  Seismology  Structural analysis  Collapse prevention  Different geometry  Far-field ground motion  Incremental dynamic analysis  Industrial buildings  Push-over analysis  Seismic fragility curves  Structural performance  Structural design,1,1
13375,"Recent natural disaster events have caused damage to structures and led to loss of lives. Steel structure industrial building is one of the important structures that needs to be examined as these structures can have huge impact on the surrounding areas. Therefore, this study presents the fragility curves and performance curves of steel structure industrial building under earthquake loading. The structure consisted of beam, column, and bracing were modelled using three dimensional finite element modelling. The fragility curves were obtained for the structure, and the performance curves were developed based on lateral load, which was affected by the geometry of the building. Three records of far-field ground motion and three records of local ground motion were used for incremental dynamic analysis (IDA). The five levels of performance stated by FEMA-273, namely, operational phase (OP), immediate occupancy (IO), damage control (DC), life safety (LS), and collapse prevention (CP) were used as main guidelines to evaluate the structural performance. Results showed that, probability damage for operational phase, OP started at 0.19g and 5% of the structure analysed are expected to have immediate occupancy IO, indicating minor cracks to the structure at 0.4g PGA.

13376,"Fragility curves are useful tools for the probabilistic assessment of the seismic performance of buildings. Nonlinear structural analyses with uncertainties in load and resistance are required to develop fragility curves. A statistically sufficient number of earthquake ground motion records should ideally be obtained from past records of the region of interest to have a satisfying fragility curve. However, the number of available earthquake records in many seismically active zones is limited. In such a situation, use of the synthetic ground motions is an accepted alternative for fragility analyses of buildings. This paper compares the seismic fragility curves obtained from synthetic and natural ground motion records. It is found that synthetic ground motions result in conservative fragility curves with lesser dispersion in drift demand when compared with natural recorded ground motions. © 2018 Ingenta.",Seismic fragility curves using natural and synthetic ground motions,2017,Dispersion  Fragility curve  Performance level  Synthetic ground motion  Uncertainty,Dispersion (waves)  Dispersions  Image segmentation  Seismic waves  Structural analysis  Uncertainty analysis  Earthquake ground motions  Fragility curves  Nonlinear structural analysis  Performance level  Probabilistic assessments  Seismically active zones  Synthetic ground motions  Uncertainty  Earthquakes,1,1

Therefore, assessing its effects on structural performance has become a fundamental issue in seismic engineering.

In order to reproduce the nonlinear cyclic behavior (dilation tendency and the increase in cyclic shear strength) due to liquefaction, nonlinear hysteretic materials and advanced plasticity models were applied.

13383,"Malawi is an earthquake-prone country that lies within the East African Rift. A large proportion of its population lives in non-engineered single-storey constructions made of clay bricks and low-strength mortar. Walls are typically single-skin and often lack adequate wall-to-wall connections, leaving them vulnerable to seismic actions. This work reports a comprehensive study on the seismic fragility of unreinforced masonry buildings of the Malawi housing stock. The probability of exceeding different levels of in-plane/out-of-plane damage is estimated by considering the aleatory and epistemic uncertainties of the problem. Inter-building and intra-building variability are accounted for by adopting material test results and building survey data collected in Malawi. The in-plane capacity of building walls is calculated through a finite element model that considers the orthotropic properties of masonry. The out-of-plane capacity is computed using an analytical solution, developed for walls in one way bending. In addition, record-to-record variability is considered. The new country-specific fragility models result more conservative that global estimates, which reflects the high vulnerability of Malawian masonry buildings. These fragilities can be integrated into catastrophe modelling platforms for earthquake risk assessment in Malawi and in the wider East African region. © 2021 The Author(s)",Seismic fragility models for typical non-engineered URM residential buildings in Malawi,2021,Earthquake vulnerability  Fragility curves  In-plane damage  Malawi  Masonry panel test data  Orthotropic model  Out-of-plane damage  Residential buildings  Unreinforced masonry,None,1,1
13388,"Seismic fragility of lightly reinforced concrete frames with masonry infills is assessed through numerical simulations considering uncertainty in ground motion and building materials. To achieve this aim, a numerical model of the components is developed, a rational approach to proportion and locate individual struts in the equivalent three-strut model is proposed, and an explicit nonlinear column shear response model accounting for the infill-column interaction and soft-story mechanism is employed. The proposed numerical model is used to (1) generate probabilistic seismic demand models accounting for a wide range of ground motion intensities with different frequency content and (2) determine limit state models obtained from nonlinear pushover analysis and incremental dynamic analysis. Using the demand and limit state model, fragility curves for the masonry-infilled frames are developed to investigate the impact of various infill properties on the frame vulnerability. It is observed that the beneficial effect of the masonry infill diminishes at more severe limit states because of the interaction with the boundary frame. In some cases, this effect almost vanishes or switches to an adverse effect beyond a threshold of ground motion intensities. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Seismic fragility of lightly reinforced concrete frames with masonry infills,2015,Equivalent strut model  Infill-column interaction  Limit state model  Masonry-infilled reinforced concrete frame  Probabilistic seismic demand model  Seismic fragility,Concretes  Motion analysis  Numerical models  Offshore pipelines  Reinforced concrete  Seismology  Structural analysis  Struts  Uncertainty analysis  Equivalent struts  Infill-column interaction  Limit state model  Probabilistic seismic demand models  Reinforced concrete frames  Seismic fragility  Masonry materials  column  construction material  dynamic analysis  ground motion  infill  numerical model  probability  reinforced concrete  seismic response,1,1
13389,"Seismic vulnerability of low-ductile reinforced concrete (RC) frames which have not been designed for earthquake loads has been a concern for countries with low-to-medium seismicity like Malaysia. These types of structures represent the majority of existing buildings in Malaysia and their safety level is of interest for authorities to plan for their retrofit. This study is conducted to assess the vulnerability of low-ductile reinforced concrete frame in Malaysia when subjected earthquake records through the development of seismic fragility curves. Three types of structural models were designed for gravity and lateral loads based on the common practices in Malaysia which included RC frames with three, six, and nine stories. The structures were analyzed using incremental dynamic analysis (IDA). In addition, pushover analysis was used to determine inter-story drift demands. The earthquake records were divided into three groups based on their peak ground acceleration (PGA) to peak ground velocity (PGV) ratios. Three structural performance levels namely immediate occupancy (IO), life safety (LS), and collapse prevention (CP) were considered for the selected frames. The results showed that records with the low PGA/PGV ratios that represented far-field earthquakes imposed the highest level of damage to the low-ductile RC frames. It was observed that the probability of seismic induced damage increased as the height of structures increased. The three story RC frame showed brittle failure mechanism when subjected to employed earthquake records. The probability of exceeding CP level under far-field records and the PGA of 0.2g was more than 50% for three and nine story RC frames. It was concluded that three and nine stories RC frames constructed in the East Malaysia did not satisfy the no-collapse requirements and needed to be retrofitted. © IAEME Publication.",Seismic fragility of low ductile reinforced concrete frame in malaysia,2018,Incremental dynamic analysis  Non-ductile reinforced concrete frame  Seismic fragility curves  Seismic performance level  Vulnerability assessment,None,1,1
13391,"Typical steel moment-resisting frames (MRF) of six-storey buildings in Vancouver and Montreal were designed for three different provisions of the National Building Code of Canada (1960s, 1980s, and 2010). Numerical models were developed in OpenSees to understand the seismic performance of the structures. These models accounted for strength and stiffness degradation through appropriate representations of the beam-column connection behaviours, which were calibrated against experimental results available in the literature. The behaviour of the buildings was evaluated through pushover and nonlinear time history analyses. The pushover analysis results showed that the 1960s and 2010 steel MRFs of both cities exhibited strong-column-weak-beam failure mode. The 1980s steel MRFs of both cities showed soft-storey mechanism. Fragility curves were developed for the steel MRFs based on the seismic demands evaluated using nonlinear time history analyses, which can be used for regional seismic impact assessment studies in the future. © 2015, National Research Council of Canada, All Rights Reserved.","Seismic fragility of steel moment-resisting frames in vancouver and montreal designed in the 1960s, 1980s, and 2010",2015,Seismic fragility analysis  Steel moment-resisting frames,Building codes  Earthquake resistance  Seismology  Steel beams and girders  Structural analysis  Beam - column connection  National Building Code of Canada  Nonlinear time history analysis  Seismic fragility analysis  Seismic Performance  Steel moment resisting frame  Strength and stiffness  Strong column weak beam  Structural frames  building code  column  failure analysis  hazard assessment  historical record  numerical model  seismic response  steel structure  British Columbia  Canada  Montreal  Quebec [Canada]  Vancouver [British Columbia],1,1
13449,"Unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings are the most common building typology in the rural and urban areas of Northeast India. These URM buildings suffered substantial damage during earthquakes. In this context, the paper makes an effort to assess the vulnerability of URM buildings of this region through fragility analysis. Four representative URM buildings, consisting of single- and double-storey, have been selected from a group of buildings in the Northeastern part of India based on a suitable statistical parameter to reflect the commonly constructed building typology. Following the equivalent frame modelling approach, each building has been modelled with varying material properties, and thus, a total of 60 building models have been developed. Non-linear static analysis is performed for all the buildings to obtain the probability distribution function (pdf) of the damage states based on the capacity curve parameters. Inelastic displacement demands have been calculated for all the buildings based on the expressions given in FEMA 440 along with the response spectrum of Indian seismic code, IS 1893 Part I. Fragility curves are then derived from the complementary cumulative distribution function (cdf) of displacement demand and pdf of damage states. It is seen that there is a very high probability of suffering major to complete damage for URM buildings subjected to a peak ground acceleration of 0.18 g. Furthermore, derived fragility curves give reasonable predictions of observed post-earthquake building damage and can be used for the earthquake risk assessment of the same building typology of this Northeastern region of India. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.",Seismic vulnerability assessment of low-rise unreinforced masonry buildings in Northeast India considering variability of material properties,2021,Capacity curve  Damage states  Fragility curves  Seismic demand  URM building  Vulnerability assessment,None,1,1

13478,"Wave action during storm surge is a common cause of building damage and therefore a critical consideration when estimating structural vulnerability and mapping flood risk. Traditional depth-damage curves, however, relate building vulnerability solely to inundation depth and therefore neglect an important damage mechanism. Similarly, flood mapping studies typically emphasize expected inundation rather than wave conditions. In this study, we consider the impact of wave effects on vulnerability estimation and flood mapping using a pair of hydrodynamic models (ADCIRC + SWAN and BOUSS1D) to simulate inland storm surge flooding. The models are used to simulate flooding in a heavily impacted coastal community (Ortley Beach, New Jersey) during Hurricane Sandy (2012) and to estimate inland hazard parameters characterizing inundation, wave and velocity effects. To quantify structural vulnerability, fragility curves are developed by statistically relating the simulated hazard parameters to surveyed building damage. The results indicate that dynamic hazard characteristics such as significant wave height are the dominant predictors of severe structural damage. The flood simulation is also used to map the variation of surge and wave effects in the community. Comparing this analysis to flood zones delineated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map reveals severe wave action and building damage in a significant portion of the community deemed least exposed to flood impact. It is suspected that this misrepresentation of risk resulted from overconfidence in the performance of the community’s frontal dune under severe surge and wave actions. © 2017, The Author(s).",Simulating storm surge waves for structural vulnerability estimation and flood hazard mapping,2017,FEMA  FIRM  Flood mapping  Storm surge  Structural vulnerability  Waves,flood damage  flooding  hazard assessment  hydrodynamics  mapping method  modeling  significant wave height  storm surge  vulnerability  wave action  New Jersey  Ortley Beach  United States,1,1
13482,"Seismic fragility of a 5-storey regular shear wall building was derived through nonlinear dynamic analysis and the effect of site specific record selection and direction of applied load were investigated. Two sets of twenty synthetic earthquake records compatible with western and eastern Canadian seismicity are applied to the structural model. Fragility curves of the building were developed having spectral acceleration at the fundamental period of the structure and peak ground acceleration as seismic intensity measures. The results indicated that fragility curves are less sensitive to record selection when spectral acceleration is chosen as the seismic intensity measure, as this parameter provides a normalized format of hazard intensity. On the other hand, when peak ground acceleration is chosen as seismic intensity indicator, significant change is observed in fragility curves derived for sites with different seismicity characteristics. Numerical simulation of the building was further analyzed under western seismic records applied at an angle of 45 degree and the results of dynamic analysis and fragility curves are compared to the case that records are applied parallel to one of the principle directions. Based on the result, applying bidirectional load would cause a delay in entering nonlinear range of behaviour for the structure and therefore is not a conservative approach at lower levels of seismic intensity. © 6th International Conference on Engineering Mechanics and Materials 2017.

13524,"Flood risk management generally relies on economic assessments performed by using flood loss models of different complexity, ranging from simple univariable models to more complex multivariable models. The latter account for a large number of hazard, exposure and vulnerability factors, being potentially more robust when extensive input information is available. We collected a comprehensive data set related to three recent major flood events in northern Italy (Adda 2002, Bacchiglione 2010 and Secchia 2014), including flood hazard features (depth, velocity and duration), building characteristics (size, type, quality, economic value) and reported losses. The objective of this study is to compare the performances of expert-based and empirical (both uni- and multivariable) damage models for estimating the potential economic costs of flood events to residential buildings. The performances of four literature flood damage models of different natures and complexities are compared with those of univariable, bivariable and multivariable models trained and tested by using empirical records from Italy. The uni- and bivariable models are developed by using linear, logarithmic and square root regression, whereas multivariable models are based on two machine-learning techniques: random forest and artificial neural networks. Results provide important insights about the choice of the damage modelling approach for operational disaster risk management. Our findings suggest that multivariable models have better potential for producing reliable damage estimates when extensive ancillary data for flood event characterisation are available, while univariable models can be adequate if data are scarce. The analysis also highlights that expert-based synthetic models are likely better suited for transferability to other areas compared to empirically based flood damage models. © Author(s) 2019.

13529,"In this study, the effect of local site conditions (site class and site amplifications) and structural variability are investigated on fragility functions of typical building structures. The study area is chosen as Eastern Turkey. The fragility functions are developed using site-specific uniform hazard spectrum (UHS). The site-specific UHS is obtained based on simulated ground motions. The implementation of ground motion simulation into seismic hazard assessment has the advantage of investigating detailed local site effects. The typical residential buildings in Erzincan are represented by equivalent single degree of freedom systems (ESDOFs). Predictive equations are accomplished for structural seismic demands of ESDOFs to derive fragility functions in a straightforward manner. To study the sensitivity of fragility curves to site class, two sites on soft and stiff soil are taken into account. Two alternative site amplification functions known as generic and theoretical site amplifications are examined for these two sites. The reinforced concrete frames located on soft soil display larger fragilities than those on stiff soil. Theoretical site amplification mostly leads to larger fragilities than generic site amplification more evidently for reinforced concrete buildings. Additionally, structural variability of ESDOFs is generally observed to increase the fragility especially for rigid structural models. © 2018 Techno-Press, Ltd.",The effect of structural variability and local site conditions on building fragility functions,2018,Fragility functions  Ground motion simulation  Site effects,Concrete buildings  Degrees of freedom (mechanics)  Hazards  Reinforced concrete  Soils  Fragility function  Ground-motion simulation  Reinforced concrete frames  Seismic hazard assessment  Single degree of freedom systems  Site amplification functions  Site effects  Uniform hazard spectrums  Earthquake effects,1,1
13533,"The present paper presents an integrated model for the ex-ante evaluation of flood damages based on “stage damages curve” as a decision support tool for public and private authorities in the sustainable management of risk areas. The proposed model aims to estimate the damage both at a micro-scale and on an extended area. In particular, the dynamics of flooding in flood areas and their effects on the degree of vulnerability of the different types of buildings are considered. The proposed model, already experimented in different territorial contexts, has been applied to the case of the Senigallia flood, which took place in 2014. The first results show that the approach based on damage curves applied to different types of exposed goods at a micro-scale can reliably estimate the damages to buildings. In contrast, the ex-ante estimation of indirect damages is still uncertain due to the difficulty of evaluating, according to reliable criteria, unique assets such as intangibles and cultural and environmental assets. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.",The ex-ante evaluation of flood damages for a sustainable risk management,2019,Ex-ante evaluation  Flood damages  Integrated model  Stage damages curves,Decision support systems  Dynamics  Flood damage  Risk management  Damage curves  Decision support tools  Ex ante evaluation  Flood areas  Integrated modeling  Micro-scale  Risk areas  Sustainable management  Sustainable development,1,1
13544,"The increased availability of post-tsunami damage data over the past decade has led to a growing inventory of empirical vulnerability functions that model the damage response of buildings to tsunamis. At present, these functions are highly varied with respect to the building typologies and damage states that they represent, making it difficult to apply them effectively in tsunami vulnerability and loss assessments. This paper provides a detailed review of the methods that have been used to develop empirical vulnerability functions and identifies the key factors that are contributing to the variation seen in existing functions. Categorisation and direct comparison of existing functions show that the variation in previous work is due to significant differences in the accuracy of the hazard assessment techniques that are used, inconsistent and poorly defined damage state and building typology classification systems, the use of error-prone and incorrectly applied statistical methods and the use of post-event data that is not representative of the building damage occurring in study areas. As a result of these findings, recommendations for future work include: (1) using more accurate hazard assessment methods; (2) applying more consistent damage state classification methodologies; (3) implementing more precise building typology classification systems; and (4) ensuring that the tsunami-impacted buildings used to generate vulnerability functions are representative of the full damage and hazard range occurring in impacted areas. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",The use of empirical vulnerability functions to assess the response of buildings to tsunami impact: Comparative review and summary of best practice,2015,Building vulnerability  Catastrophe modelling  Fragility curve  Probabilistic  Tsunami damage  Vulnerability function,building  catastrophic event  comparative study  damage  empirical analysis  hazard assessment  probability  tsunami  vulnerability,1,1
13552,"Earthquakes, despite being a mostly natural phenomenon, may also be induced by a wide range of anthropogenic activities such as mining, fluid injection and extraction, hydraulic fracturing and geothermal reservoir processes. In recent years, the occurrence of induced and triggered seismicity and its potential impact on the built environment have heightened both public concern and regulatory scrutiny, motivating the need for an integrated risk management framework. Non-standard monitoring approaches provide valuable tools for mitigating the risk associated with earthquakes. These solutions include the use of advanced sensors and the implementation of performance-based rapid response systems for infrastructure, as well as monitoring the structural response of buildings and infrastructure in real time. Such technical solutions can be further used for validating damage forecasts determined by probabilistic approaches. The goal of this study is to establish a performance-driven monitoring system for induced seismicity. For this purpose, it is necessary to integrate analytical fragility curves in real time. These fragility curves can be derived by simplified vulnerability models that require input obtained from advanced exposure-monitoring techniques. Considering the case of induced seismicity, this also requires the expected damage to refer to non-structural components. Hence, the derived fragility curves are based on the non-structural damage criteria of typical residences. Therefore, a new approach is presented for defining analytical fragility curves of traditional or historic masonry structures, which can be found in large numbers near the geothermal platforms considered in this work. © 2018, The Author(s).",Toward performance-driven seismic risk monitoring for geothermal platforms: development of ad hoc fragility curves,2018,Fragility curve  Induced seismicity  Non-standard monitoring  Non-structural components  On-site monitoring system,Earthquakes  Geothermal fields  Induced Seismicity  Real time systems  Risk management  Structural analysis  Anthropogenic activity  Fragility curves  Integrated risk management  Non-structural components  Non-structural damage  On-site monitoring system  Probabilistic approaches  Vulnerability models  Monitoring  geothermal system  induced seismicity  monitoring system  vulnerability,1,1
13557,"The presence of capillary pressure in unsaturated soils may, under certain circumstances, significantly affect the stability of a slope and the safety of a structure standing in the vicinity of its crest. More specifically, the change in saturation induced by a rainfall event may directly influence the value of apparent soil cohesion potentially resulting in excessive permanent slope displacements and subsequent structural damages for the structure standing on it. Under these considerations, this study aims at the vulnerability assessment of typical reinforced concrete (RC) buildings on precarious slopes subjected to rainfall induced landslide hazard. The proposed methodology is based on a two-step numerical analysis procedure. First, the permanent absolute and differential ground displacement time histories at the assumed building location within the landslide zone are evaluated performing coupled mechanical-flow analysis of a generic initially unsaturated natural slope configuration considering the employment of different rainfall events of increased intensity at the surface of the slope model. Different soil properties of the surface layer are considered to represent silty and soft clayey soil material. Appropriate analytical relationships between the rainfall intensity and its duration and the computed permanent displacements are extracted. Then, a series of nonlinear static time history analyses are performed for reference low and mid-rise, low-code RC bare and infilled frame buildings located next to the slope's crest to assess their fragility. The buildings’ response assessed using appropriate engineering demand parameters (EDPs) to account for both the global flexural and local shear demand are statistically correlated with predefined damage limit states to construct the fragility functions. To facilitate the applicability of the proposed methodology within a quantitative landslide risk assessment framework, vulnerability curves are finally developed to quantify the expected direct losses in normalised cost terms. © 2021",Towards the vulnerability assessment of low-code RC frame buildings at precarious slopes subjected to rainfall induced landslide hazard,2021,Coupled slope mechanical-flow analysis  Fragility curves  Rainfall induced landslide hazard  Reinforced concrete buildings  Slope displacement  Structural damage,None,0,1
13562,"From the last large seismic movements generated in the Pacific Ocean, it has been demonstrated that tsunamis have a high potential of destruction of buildings on the coasts. In that sense, although along the Pacific Colombian coast several earthquakes that have generated tsunami were reported during the last century, there are no local data to quantify the physical damage that future events could produce on nearby cities. For the purpose of establishing tools to increase the risk management capabilities along the Colombian-Ecuadorian Pacific Coast, this paper summarizes a research aimed to describe a new integrated methodology to obtain fragility curves for local buildings at risk of a tsunami. This task was accomplished using computational nonlinear structural analysis, combined with a Monte Carlo statistical algorithm to obtain numerical probabilistic fragility curves. The structural capacity of buildings was obtained from nonlinear structural simulations using the finite element method, to calculate later the damage of each building. Two different damage models to estimate the probability of damage were tested in order to evaluate the one that better represents the structural behavior of buildings, in which the tsunami was considered in the structural model as forces scattered to different heights, thus representing different flow depths. As a result, a methodology was developed to calculate theoretical probabilistic fragility curves for the typical structures found in the Colombian Pacific coast, although this methodology could be expanded to any structural system located in any region around the world. As an illustrative example, the methodology proposed in this research was applied to a typical reinforced concrete building, obtained from a previous work in which all the Tumaco city buildings were characterized according to their structural features. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Tsunami analytical fragility curves for the Colombian Pacific coast: A reinforced concrete building example,2019,Colombian Pacific coast  Damage models  Fragility curves  Risk  Structural capacity  Tsunamis,Concrete buildings  Reinforced concrete  Risk management  Risks  Damage model  Fragility curves  Integrated methodology  Management capabilities  Nonlinear structural analysis  Pacific coasts  Structural capacities  Structural simulations  Tsunamis  analytical framework  building  concrete structure  damage  reinforced concrete  risk assessment  structural analysis  structural response  tsunami  Colombia  Pacific Coast [Colombia]  Pacific Coast [South America],1,1
13564,"The extensive loss of human lives and building damage sustained during past tsunamis drove development of the first tsunami risk assessment in Israel. Although past tsunamis have occurred along the eastern Mediterranean coasts, no data is available for empirical hazard and risk analysis. Thus, our assessment focused on a simulated tsunami generated by an Mw 8.2 earthquake along the eastern Cypriot Arc (about 200 km NW of Haifa) in Bat Galim, the most vulnerable neighborhood in the city of Haifa, situated along the Mediterranean coast in northern Israel. This tsunami event represents the worst-case scenario threatening Bat Galim. Exposure data were taken from the National Archives of the Survey of Israel and was verified with a field survey. Two approaches were taken to derive the most appropriate vulnerability models for the study: first, already published Damage Criteria (DC) were developed based on information from past tsunami events around the world; second, damage functions were applied using the Hazus Tsunami Model (HTM), a multi-parameter loss estimation tool built using detailed engineering knowledge. Risk was considered the product of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. Following several parametric studies and sensitivity tests, we produced loss assessment results from the two most realistic model outcomes and arrived at conclusions meaningful for tsunami preparedness in northern Israel. Most importantly, we note that the loss of life far surpasses building damage. Increasing community preparedness is the simplest and most cost-effective way to significantly reduce the risk of casualties during a tsunami. We also note that upgrading the seismic design of existing structures according to required standards in Israel will decrease vulnerability to tsunamis and expand possibilities for vertical evacuation. We discuss the accuracy and reliability of our analysis and demonstrate that a simple DC approach is useful for preliminary investigation in cases of limited data. The HTM however, requires detailed preparation and data inputs but produces more realistic loss estimates. These insights may aid others during future implementation of tsunami loss modeling in threatened coastal communities.","Tsunami loss assessment based on Hazus approach - The Bat Galim, Israel, case study",2021,Building vulnerability  Fragility curves  HAZUS  Mediterranean coast  Risk  Tsunami loss,VULNERABILITY  HAZARD  BUILDINGS  RISK  SEISMOTECTONICS  DEFORMATION  DEBRIS  IMPACT  FAULT  FIELD,1,1
13599,"The use of fragility curves for the assessment of seismic losses is in increasing demand, both for pre-earthquake disaster planning as well as post-earthquake recovery and retrofitting programs. Fragility curves; important components of accurate risk assessment are functions that describe the probability of failure, conditioned on the full range of loads to which a system might be exposed. In general fragility curves provide estimates for the probabilities of a structure reaching/ exceeding limiting deformation at given levels of ground shaking or it is a plot of the computed probability (deflection) Vs. Ground motion parameter. The scope of the proposed research is to develop fragility curves as a tool to develop suitable measures that can help in estimating the losses for the structures, similar to the case study building and thus to develop the same as an important tool in earthquake engineering mainly for urban risk reduction. The objective of the proposed study is the reliability assessment of the case study building to earthquake loadings through the development of fragility curves. The vulnerability of the structure is expressed with the development of fragility curves, which provides the probability of exceeding a prescribed level of damage for a wide range of ground motion intensities. Primary task is to identify a case study structure for which fragility curves are not developed yet and which could effectively represent the structural viability of present and future buildings. It is based on a concept that similar type of structures (structural typology) will have same probability of a given damage state for given earthquake intensity. Hence effective methods to develop fragility curves for representative buildings are very vital in earthquake engineering. We propose to develop fragility curves for a building with flat-slabs and shear wall system which effectively represents recent high rise buildings particularly in GCC countries. © Research India Publications.",Vulnerability assessment using fragility curves,2017,Earthquake engineering  Earthquake engineering  Flat slab structures  Fragility curves  Reliability analysis  Shear wall system,None,1,1

12505,"In this paper, a novel predictive model for the seismic vulnerability assessment of old Italian minor historical centres is presented. The proposed methodology is based on the use of eight seismic parameters, which can be easily extracted from the CARTIS form, a new tool for collecting building inventories at the regional scale, promoted by the Italian Civil Protection. The proposed method takes inspiration from a 14 parameters-based empirical method calibrated by the authors after the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake and validated also on the base of the damage scenarios of the 2016 Central Italy earthquake. However, with respect to the original method, the applied procedure is properly modified in order to provide the same results even if the type amd the number of input information is different. In the first part of the paper, the CARTIS form is presented. Then the proposed methodology is shown and the eight seismic parameters used for its application are discussed. Finally, in order to show the feasibility of the method, it is applied to the case study of Grottazzolina, a small town located in the administrative region of Marche, in Italy, for which fragility curves are provided as a useful tool for predicting the damage scenarios that could potentially occur under different earthquake intensities.

12506,"The study focuses on the probabilistic seismic risk assessment of earthquake prone old urban centers. This issue becomes even more complex if the considered area is a highly populated, cultural or commercial center. Hence it is an important task to estimate regional earthquake losses and to develop strategies for earthquake mitigation through seismic risk prioritization among such vulnerable populated old urban areas. For this purpose, a sub-district with six neighborhoods in Beyoglu, Istanbul has been selected as the study area, which is located in a high-seismicity region. This is one of the most attractive cultural places in the city as well as a commercial center with a high population. Building stock is dense and composed of many old and deficient buildings located within close vicinity of active faults. For risk assessment, site-specific hazard curves are obtained first. Then reinforced concrete and masonry buildings in the region are classified by using the results of a recent walk down survey data and fragility curve sets that reflect local structural characteristics of the buildings in the area are attained to each class. In the last step, probabilistic seismic risk assessment approach is utilized to obtain the estimated damage state distributions at the considered neighborhoods for a 50-year time interval. The results reveal the urgency in order to take precautions to mitigate earthquake losses in vulnerable old urban centers. This study is deemed to propose a potential approach by carrying out site-specific hazard, vulnerability and risk assessments as an assistance to risk mitigation efforts. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",A case study for probabilistic seismic risk assessment of earthquake-prone old urban centers,2021,Fragility curves  Istanbul  Old urban center  Probabilistic approach  Risk assessment  Seismic hazard,None,0,1
12509,"A recently introduced structural steel braced frame known as the strongback system (SBS) is a hybrid of a conventional bracing system and an essentially elastic vertical truss. This elastic backbone is designed to distribute seismic demands uniformly over the height of the building and consequently prevent damage concentration. Recent studies on developing design procedures for SBSs revealed that prescriptive code-based methods are inadequate to estimate their seismic demands, and they cannot ensure to fulfill the performance objectives properly. Here, to properly evaluate the seismic behavior of a wide variety of the practical configurations of SBS, a comprehensive parametric study is carried out on elastic backbone configuration, rigidity, and height. To this end, a series of different SBS archetypes are designed using a direct performance-based method, and the fulfillment of the performance targets is probabilistically assessed. Their over-strength factors, ductility ratios, and collapse fragility curves are compared together and with the performance of structures using conventional system and design method. Results indicate that the archetypes with the brace intersection point of two-third of the length of the beam, namely X-2/3 configuration, have shown the largest ductility ratio and lowest collapse probability, while the archetypes with chevron configuration have shown the smallest ductility ratio and highest collapse probability. Further, by increasing the rigidity of the vertical backbone, ductility ratio and the median spectral acceleration at collapse level are improved, and SBS archetypes tended to have uniform story drift distribution patterns. Applying the direct performance-based method in six-story structures reduces the story drift ratios of SBS up to 30%. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",A comparative performance-based seismic assessment of strongback steel braced frames,2021,Collapse fragility curves  Elastic truss  Performance-based seismic design  Strongback system  Yield frequency spectra,Building materials  Ductility  Rigid structures  Rigidity  Seismic design  Seismology  Steel construction  Structural frames  Collapse fragility curve  Collapse probabilities  Ductility ratio  Elastic truss  Performance based method  Performance based seismic design  Seismic demands  Steel braced frames  Strongback system  Yield frequency spectrum  Trusses,0,1
12513,"Different sources of uncertainties contribute to the collapse and safety assessment of structures. In this paper, impact of construction quality (CQ) is considered in developing analytical collapse fragility curves for moment resisting steel frames. Furthermore, the interaction of this source of uncertainty with epistemic uncertainty inherent in modeling parameters, due to lack of knowledge and inaccuracy of predictor equations, is investigated. Beam strength, column strength, beam ductility, and column ductility meta-variables are defined as modeling parameters which are being suffered by informal uncertainty. Quadratic equations for the mean and the standard deviation of collapse fragility curves are derived by utilizing response surfaces, which are interpolated to analytically-derived values considering realizations for modeling variables and for various levels of construction quality. To the best of the authors' knowledge, interaction of modeling and CQ uncertainty in analytical collapse fragility curve has not been considered in previous investigations. A fuzzy rule-based method is applied to employ the effects of uncertainty due to CQ. Using Monte Carlo simulation for the modeling variables and the construction quality index, and subsequently computing response surface coefficients via a fuzzy inference system, and finally deriving collapse fragility curve parameters through response surfaces, result in collapse fragility curves of structures. In developing these curves, different sources of uncertainties are involved, ranging from lexical to informal and stochastic types. It is concluded that neglecting the effects of these sources leads to the underestimation of collapse fragility probability. This shows the importance of considering modeling and construction quality uncertainty effects on collapse fragility curves. It is shown that for a sample moment resisting steel frame collapse probability is increased 53% and 60% for 10% and 2% probability of exceedance in 50 years seismic hazard levels, respectively, while interaction of CQ and modeling uncertainties are considered in comparison with neglecting them. Otherwise, if only modeling uncertainty is involved, this increment is evaluated at 42% and 16%, respectively for the aforementioned probabilities of exceedance.",A comprehensive collapse fragility assessment of moment resisting steel frames considering various sources of uncertainties,2016,collapse fragility curves  uncertainty sources  fuzzy inference system  moment resisting steel structures  incremental dynamic analysis  response surface method,REINFORCED-CONCRETE BUILDINGS  FUZZY  PERFORMANCE  CURVES  RISK,0,1
12519,"In certain coastal areas across the globe, tsunamis pose a great threat to buildings, infrastructure and people's lives. The prevailing approaches for assessing building damage are based on probabilistic analysis. This paper introduces a new deterministic approach to assess large-scale building damage through quantifying lateral loading on structures induced by tsunami waves. A depth-averaged hydrodynamic model is adopted to simulate tsunami propagation and inundation and calculate the induced pressures and forces on structures. The model solves the 2D nonlinear shallow water equations (SWEs) using a finite volume shock-capturing numerical scheme and is implemented on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to achieve high-performance computing for large-scale applications. A new model component is included to calculate pressures and forces using the predicted flow variables, i.e. water depth and velocities. The resulting maximum tsunami forces are combined with a lateral force resisting system on each building to estimate damage states. This new approach is developed by taking advantages of a similar damage assessment method and the corresponding coefficients for quantifying earthquake impact on buildings, due to the similarity between the horizontal force systems induced by tsunami waves and earthquake motions. After being successfully validated against three experimental cases related to flow hydrodynamics, pressures and forces, the model is used to simulate a hypothetical 1000-year tsunami event in the City of Seaside, Oregon, USA. The resulting damage states are then classified for each of the urban buildings in the area, taking into account different building types. The predicted results are consistent with those obtained using alternative approaches, confirming the potential of the proposed approach for practical engineering applications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",A deterministic approach for assessing tsunami-induced building damage through quantification of hydrodynamic forces,2019,Building damage assessment  Deterministic methods  Hydrodynamic force  Lateral force resisting system  Tsunami modelling,Buildings  Computer graphics  Earthquakes  Equations of motion  Graphics processing unit  Hydrodynamics  Nonlinear equations  Program processors  Tsunamis  Building damage  Deterministic methods  High performance computing  Hydrodynamic forces  Large-scale applications  Lateral force resisting system  Non-linear shallow water equations  Practical engineering applications  Damage detection  building  damage  finite volume method  hydrodynamic force  loading  numerical model  quantitative analysis  shallow-water equation  tsunami  Oregon  United States,0,1
12529,"The effectiveness of various vibration control strategies has always been a debate among structural engineers. Seismic base isolation systems and passive dampers are recognized as two of the most economical devices which have passive mechanisms in reducing the structural vibration and responses. To this end, comprehensive biaxial shake table testings have been carried out on a building frame with and without a proposed base isolation system. The proposed device has a novel combined isolation mechanism at the structure's base. By different methods of testing, natural frequencies and viscous damping for the frame model with and without the proposed system were identified. Both structures were intensively tested under various earthquake motions, and various structural responses were recorded. The experimental results indicated that the newly proposed system is very effective in controlling the vibration of building structures and can be used to increase the seismic resilience metrics. As a complementary investigation, the incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) was conducted to develop the seismic fragility curves under both near-field and far-field strong ground motions (SGMs). The fragility estimations indicated that the proposed system has a higher collapse margin ratio (CMR) compared to conventional fixed-base frames. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",A hybrid seismic isolation system toward more resilient structures: Shaking table experiment and fragility analysis,2021,Base isolation  Collapse margin  Fragility curve  Hybrid control  Low-damage  Passive damper  Seismic resilience  Shaking table  Steel structure,Structural dynamics  Vibration control  Base isolation systems  Incremental dynamic analysis  Seismic base isolation  Seismic fragility curves  Seismic isolation systems  Shaking table experiment  Strong ground motion  Structural vibrations  Earthquakes,0,1
12530,"The current paper presents the development and seismic assessment of the Smart Hybrid Resilient building (SHR). This novel building is comprised of self-centering dampers in parallel with Pall friction dampers. The design methodology and equations are first introduced with aim of creating the seismic resilience feature in structures. The designed SHR systems have the capability to adjust and control the residual drift of each story (covers the disadvantage of Pall system) in addition to high energy-dissipating capacity (covers the downside of expensive shape memory alloy-based system). Based on FEMA P-58 recommendation, 0.2% and 0.5% drift ratios are considered as the economical residual drift limitations of specimens. Limiting the story residual drift to these thresholds makes the decision of repairing structure after earthquake occurrence more rational rather than rebuilding the new one. In order to the comprehensive assessment of SHR system performance and precision of design equations, some specimens with diverse heights and various consumed shape memory alloy materials are modeled in OpenSees. Afterwards, all the SHR specimens in comparison with purely Self-Center systems are subjected to quasi-static cyclic loading analysis and incremental dynamic analysis. Fragility curves are also used to evaluate the efficiency of seismic performance of the SHR system in a probabilistic framework.

12537,"Since the current process to achieve the collapse fragility curve in practical applications seems too complicated, also time-consuming to dominant by structure designers, the focus of this study is on introducing of a new approach for establishing collapse fragility curves which requires less analytical effort. To achieve this goal, state-based philosophy (SBP) has been taken into consideration. This theory benefits from some similarities in the nature of every failure process in solid mechanics regardless of its source. In this study these similarities are used intelligently in procedure of formulating new fragility function which has couple of unknown parameters. Next, it will be shown that these parameters can be attained from two different sources: the pushover curves of the structure, some selective damage data from incremental dynamic analysis analyses. Finally a complete form of new collapse fragility function which is called SBP fragility function proposed as a substitute for conventional collapse fragility function.

12544,"Predicting the seismic loss of a building is critical for its resilience. A prediction method for building seismic loss based on the building information model (BIM) and FEMA P-58 is proposed in this study. First, a component-level damage prediction algorithm is designed to establish the mapping from BIM components to the performance groups (PGs) in FEMA P-58, and to predict the component damage using the BIM-based time-history analysis (THA) and the fragility curves of PGs. Subsequently, an ontology-based model considering the deduction rules in the local unit-repair-cost database is created for obtaining exact measurement data of components in a BIM. Meanwhile, a component-level loss prediction algorithm is developed using the measurement data and the unit repair costs corresponding to damage states, by which the predicted seismic losses can agree with the actual situation of the specific region. Finally, a component-level visualization algorithm is designed to display the seismic damage and loss in a virtual reality (VR) environment. A six-story office building in Beijing is used as a pilot test to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.

12552,"In this study, a simplified procedure to predict the maximum inter-story drift demands of mid-rise framed buildings in terms of a spectral-shape-based ground motion intensity measure is proposed. For this aim, the maximum inter-story drift of steel and reinforced concrete (R/C) frames with 4, 6, 8 and 10 stories subjected to several narrow-band ground motions is estimated as a function of the spectral acceleration at first mode of vibration of the structure Sa(T1), which is commonly used in earthquake engineering and seismology, and with the recently developed parameter related to the structural response known as INp. It is observed that the spectral-shape-based intensity measure INp is the parameter best related with the structural response of the selected frames under narrow-band motions. Therefore, a new approach is used to propose equations to compute maximum inter-story drift demands and seismic uncertainty of mid-rise frames as a function of INp. The equations can be used for the rapid seismic assessment and to obtain structural fragility curves of the steel and R/C frame models. The fragility curves obtained with the simplified approach are compared to those obtained with traditional procedure to compute structural fragility.

12563,"The abundance of training data is not guaranteed in various supervised learning applications. One of these situations is the post-earthquake regional damage assessment of buildings. Querying the damage label of each building requires a thorough inspection by experts, and thus, is an expensive task. A practical approach is to sample the most informative buildings in a sequential learning scheme. Active learning methods recommend the most informative cases that are able to maximally reduce the generalization error. The information-theoretic measure of mutual information (MI), which maximizes the expected information gain over the input domain, can be used for informative sampling of a dataset in a pool-based scenario. However, the computational complexity of the standard MI algorithm prevents the utilization of this method on large datasets. A local kernels strategy was proposed to reduce the computational costs, but the adaptability of the kernels to the observed labels was not considered in the original formulation of this strategy. In this article, an adaptive local kernels methodology is developed that enables the conformability of the kernels to the observed output data while enhancing the computational complexity of the standard MI algorithm. The proposed algorithm is developed to work with a Gaussian process regression (GPR) method, where the kernel hyperparameters are updated after each label query using maximum likelihood estimation. In the sequential learning procedure, the updated hyperparameters can be used in the MI kernel matrices to improve the sample suggestion performance. The advantages of the proposed method are demonstrated in a simulation of the 2018 Anchorage, AK, earthquake. It is shown that while the proposed algorithm enables GPR to reach acceptable performance using fewer training data, the computational demand remains lower than the standard local kernels strategy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Adaptive local kernels formulation of mutual information with application to active post-seismic building damage inference,2021,Active learning  Earthquake damage estimation  Gaussian process regression  Mutual information  Regional damage assessment,Artificial intelligence  Computational complexity  Damage detection  Earthquakes  Gaussian distribution  Maximum likelihood estimation  Active Learning  Earthquake damage estimation  Gaussian process regression  Hyper-parameter  Information algorithms  Local kernel  Mutual informations  Regional damage assessment  Sequential learning  Training data  Gaussian noise (electronic),0,1
12566,"Bringing together state-of-the-art high-performance computing, remote sensing and spatial information sciences, we established a real-time tsunami inundation forecasting, damage estimation and mapping system to enhance disaster response.

12568,"A novel approach for structural system optimal design considering life cycle cost is developed. Specifically, a performance-based multi-objective design optimization framework for nonlinear/hysteretic multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) structural systems subject to evolutionary stochastic excitation is formulated. In the core of the stochastic structural analysis component of the proposed framework lies an efficient approximate dimension reduction technique based on the concepts of statistical linearization and of stochastic averaging for determining the non-stationary system response amplitude probability density functions (PDFs); thus, computationally intensive Monte Carlo simulations are circumvented. Note that the approach can readily handle stochastic excitations of arbitrary non-separable evolutionary power spectral density (EPSD) forms that exhibit strong variability in both the intensity and the frequency content. Further, approximate closed-form expressions are derived for the non-stationary inter-story drift ratio amplitude PDFs corresponding to each and every DOF. In this regard, considering appropriately defined damage measures structural system related fragility curves are determined at a low computational cost as well. Finally, the structural system design optimization problem is formulated as a multi-objective one to be solved by a genetic algorithm based approach.

12571,"Deterioration parameters that are commonly used to simulate nonlinear behavior of steel components were mainly calibrated based on the results from experiments on steel beams. Recently, the state of knowledge for deterioration behavior of steel columns has been improved by experimental and analytical studies on the wide-flange steel columns. These deteriorating characteristics are introduced as regression relationships in which the associated uncertainties are represented by the coefficient of variation (COV). Accounting for these uncertainties in estimating collapse fragility curves through the incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) and simulation-based reliability methods is impractical due to the large amount of required computational effort. In this study, two main goals are pursued. The first goal is comprehensive evaluation of the main, interaction, and quadratic effects of the modeling random variables on the collapse capacity of steel structures. The second goal is to propose an efficient approach to create response surface (RS), which in combination with the Monte Carlo (MC) sampling method will be used to incorporate modeling uncertainties into the collapse fragility. This efficiency will be achieved by employing screening design techniques to reduce the amount of analysis required to create a quadratic RS and also endurance time (ET) analysis as an efficient alternative nonlinear dynamic analysis method with less computational time to estimate the structural responses. In order to develop a reliable probabilistic model, the Bayesian model inference approach is applied to account for the uncertainties in the created model. The proposed procedure is performed with both IDA and ET methods on a prototype 5-story steel frame. Results indicate that collapse capacity is highly influenced by the strength modeling variables of beam as well as the ultimate rotation capacity of column components. In addition, ET method by a considerable reduction in the computational costs provides comparable responses with IDA in a probabilistic framework.",An efficient method for incorporating modeling uncertainties into collapse fragility of steel structures,2021,Collapse fragility  Response surface  Monte Carlo sampling  Design of experiments  Endurance time method  Bayesian inferential approach,INCREMENTAL DYNAMIC-ANALYSIS  SEISMIC PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT  ENDURANCE TIME METHOD  DESIGN  RISK  SENSITIVITY  PROBABILITY  BUILDINGS  STRENGTH  IMPACTS,0,1
12577,"The efficiency of post-quake emergency management depends heavily on the speed of seismic damage assessment software, which depends on the evaluation algorithm essentially. Traditional seismic damage assessment models based on sequence algorithms usually need tens of minutes to get visualized results. More efficient computing models for seismic damage assessment are demanded urgently. General parallel evaluation algorithm based on GPU computing framework was investigated by the authors, and an improved seismic damage assessment model for buildings was proposed in this paper. We designed a three-level parallel scheme to accelerate the computing and visualization. At the top level, the earthquake area is divided into smaller regions, such as cities or counties. At the middle level, fundamental geographic data for each region is split into layers by features. At the bottom level, buildings are grouped into several types, which can be processed by GPU cores simultaneously. The developed model can estimate and analyze the seismic damage of buildings and the spatial distribution of victims in earthquake region more rapidly than traditional models. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",An Improved Seismic Damage Assessment Model for Buildings Based on Parallel Algorithms,2019,assessment model  buildings  GPU  parallel algorithm  seismic damage,Bridge components  Buildings  Earthquakes  Environmental engineering  Graphics processing unit  Parallel algorithms  Risk management  Structural analysis  Assessment models  Emergency management  Evaluation algorithm  Parallel evaluation  Seismic damage  Seismic damage assessment  Sequence algorithms  Traditional models  Damage detection,0,1
12578,"Seismic damage assessment is an extraordinary opportunity to evaluate the reliability of vulnerability and risk methodologies applied to historic masonry buildings, giving the possibility of enhancing and optimising mitigation and retrofit strategies. Vulnerability index methodologies are flexible and powerful tools for assessing seismic vulnerability on the urban scale, providing a first screening of the critical issues present in masonry buildings and a possible priority list for the following retrofit operations. Such approaches account for the buildings' different structural characteristics, directly or indirectly influencing their seismic behaviour and measured through different weights and classes finally providing a vulnerability index. In this paper, we show the application of three well-known methodologies to Campi Alto di Norcia's medieval city in Valnerina (Italy) stroke by the earthquakes of 24 August and 30 October 2016. The methodologies' reliability is assessed, based on the observation of real seismic consequences and damages on the masonry buildings, and an optimised methodology is then proposed for the considered case study.","An Improved Seismic Vulnerability Assessment Approach for Historical Urban Centres: The Case Study of Campi Alto di Norcia, Italy",2021,vulnerability index method  damage scenarios  masonry buildings  seismic assessment  structural aggregates,None,0,1
12580,"In recent years, several locations in the United States have been experiencing a significant increase in seismicity that has been attributed to oil and gas production. As oil and natural gas production in the United States continues to increase, it is expected that the seismic hazard in these locations will continue to experience a corresponding upsurge. However, many urban structures in these locations are not designed to withstand these increasing levels of seismicity. Accordingly, it is crucial to develop methodologies that can help us quantify the seismic performance of these structures, establish their risk levels, and identify optimal retrofit strategies that will enhance the seismic resilience of these structures. In this context, structural health monitoring (SHM) plays an important role in understanding the seismic performance of structures. SHM can be used, in conjunction with finite element modelling, to provide a realistic representation of the structural performance during a seismic event. In this paper, a framework for seismic risk assessment of reinforced concrete buildings based on SHM is presented. The framework combines nonlinear finite element modeling and SHM data to establish the seismic fragility profile of the structure. The approach is illustrated on a multistory reinforced concrete structure located on the Oklahoma State University Campus. © 20th Congress of IABSE, New York City 2019: The Evolving Metropolis - Report.

12587,"This study investigates the building damage ratio based on damage survey data of the 2016 Kumamoto, Japan, earthquake. Most of building fragility curves in Japan were developed based on the actual damage data in the 1995 Kobe earthquake. However, already 24 years have passed after this event, and hence it is better to use recent earthquake data in Japan. In this study, the building damage in Uki City, Kumamoto prefecture, was analyzed based on the damage survey data by the local government. The damage ratios of buildings were investigated from the viewpoints of structural material and construction period. As the result, the damage ratio of wooden buildings was found to be larger than those of other structural materials (Reinforced Concrete (RC), Steel (S) and Light-gauge Steel (LS)), and it got higher as the construction period becomes older. The spatial distribution of damaged buildings was further investigated with their locations. The results were compared with the distribution of peak ground velocity values and the fragility curves of wooden buildings for four construction periods were developed.

12590,"Fragility curves have proved to be an efficient tool for the seismic vulnerability assessment of buildings made of stone masonry such as those located in historic districts of Eastern Canadian cities. However, most studies do not take into consideration the case of collapse in the out-of-plane direction. This failure mode may be critical for elements such as chimneys, firewalls, and front walls. This study focuses on the assessment of seismic vulnerability of stone masonry buildings sensitive to out-of-plane failure. A model of out-of-plane capacity showing the degree of damage in terms of displacements was developed as well as a calculation method for displacements in the out-of-plane direction taking into account the filter effect of the building in plane direction.

This is implemented on a medium height reinforced concrete building designed prior to the seismic ductility provisions being added to the ACI code. Focusing on medium height concrete buildings allows the research to be adjusted and applied to a wide range of occupancy types. Pushover analysis was carried out to verify the response of the building is as expected and the modeling is accurate for the shear wall and moment frame systems. This was followed by a non-linear time history analysis to collect column rotation information. Fragility curves are developed to obtain statistical damage ratios under different retrofit methods.

12602,"The Small Island Developing States are characterized by an unstable economy and low-lying, densely populated cities, resulting in a high vulnerability to natural hazards. Flooding affects more people than any other hazard. To limit the consequences of these hazards, adequate risk assessments are indispensable. Satisfactory input data for these assessments are hard to acquire, especially in developing countries. Therefore, in this study, a methodology was developed and evaluated to test the sensitivity of a flood model towards its input data in order to determine a minimum set of indispensable data. In a first step, a flood damage assessment model was created for the case study of Annotto Bay, Jamaica. This model generates a damage map for the region based on the flood extent map of the 2001 inundations caused by Tropical Storm Michelle. Three damages were taken into account: building, road and crop damage. Twelve scenarios were generated, each with a different combination of input data, testing one of the three damage calculations for its sensitivity. One main conclusion was that population density, in combination with an average number of people per household, is a good parameter in determining the building damage when exact building locations are unknown. Furthermore, the importance of roads for an accurate visual result was demonstrated. © 2016 Author(s).",Analyzing the sensitivity of a flood risk assessment model towards its input data,2016,None,developing world  flood damage  hazard assessment  risk assessment  sensitivity analysis  tropical cyclone event  Jamaica,0,1
12606,"Detection and characterization of territorial elements exposed to flood is a key component for flood risk analysis. Land-use description works well for small scales of representation but it becomes too coarse while increasing the scale. ""Single-element"" characterization is usually achieved through surveys, which become prohibitive as the amount of elements to be characterized increases. Mapping schemes represent a compromise between level of description and efforts for data collection. The basic idea is to determine the statistical distribution of building characteristics inside a homogeneous class starting from a sample area and to apply this distribution to the whole area, realizing a statistical extrapolation. An innovative approach was developed, merging the mapping scheme methodologies developed by the Global Earthquake Model [1] and Blanco-Vogt and Schanze [2], in which homogeneous classes are not development areas but building clusters. The approach was applied to the buildings in the Bisagno River floodplain, Genoa (Italy). Buildings were classified according to a building taxonomy. Once the percentage of basement presence was assigned to each class by surveying a limited subset of the exposed assets, a series of possible basement distributions was simulated to calculate the corresponding damage distributions for a real flood event. The total average damage obtained is very close to the refund claims, with a percentage error lower than 2%. © 2016 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",Application of an Earth-Observation-based building exposure mapping tool for flood damage assessment,2016,None,None,0,1
12611,"This paper presents a system reliability-based framework for collapse fragility assessment of steel braced moment-resisting frames (BMRFs). The conditional failure of intermediate events is calculated, considering two important features in the design of BMRFs: (i) different failure scenarios (FSs) with multiple sequences of components failure formation and (ii) structural reliability analysis based on the failure propagation from components to system. The system collapse reliability-based assessment of BMRFs is developed with an efficient algorithm using the Monte Carlo simulation procedure incorporated into a nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis program. An appropriate nonlinear FE model of such systems is demonstrated, and the probability of various predefined components' failure over the most likely FSs in the presence of both epistemic and inherent uncertainties is calculated. Then, a system-simulated reliability index (SSRI) is computed by lower and upper bounds in the probability of BMRF system collapse. Finally, fragility curves based on the SSRI is compared with the ones from incremental dynamic analysis, and later, the outcomes from multiple FSs are compared with the codified main collapse criterion. For the BMRFs analyzed herein, it is shown that the existing allowable story drift for the collapse limit state is conservative, and a new criterion is appraised.

12617,"Explosive population and economic development in the city has forced engineer to design and build more vertical buildings. In order to be resilient in earthquake prone region, these tall buildings have to achieve a specific level of performance under earthquake loading. A comprehensive methodology for assessing the seismic performance is required which can be attained by developing structural fragility function of the structure. Fragility curves is a probabilistic function relating damage level (engineering demand parameter) with intensity measure, i.e. spectral acceleration. This paper investigates the seismic performance of moment resisting frame as compared to frame-wall system of structures. The structural response of fully deterministic structural models was, then, analyzed employing nonlinear pushover analysis yielding capacity spectrums. For each capacity spectrum in every building system, the damage states were defined, whereas average inter-story drift values for each damage state were converted into corresponding amount of spectral acceleration leading to the development of fragility curves.

12618,"The seismic assessment of existing school buildings is of paramount importance to protect the lives of occupants and manage post-earthquake response and recovery. The collapse of a primary school during the 2002 Molise earthquake in Southern Italy increased the awareness of the need to better understand the potential vulnerability of the existing Italian school building stock. To this end, a recent research project entitled Progetto Scuole, whose main objective was to assess the seismic risk of a number of representative school buildings, was carried out at the Eucentre Foundation, in collaboration with the University School for Advanced Studies IUSS, in Pavia, Italy. The results of this project and of the subsequent research conducted by the authors are discussed in this paper, starting with the compilation of a school building database, focusing on the structural typology, the geometrical configuration and the time of construction. Three schools, representative of the Italian school building stock, were then analysed in detail through advanced numerical models developed using information collected during in-situ inspections and calibrated with the results of ambient vibration measurements. Two site locations were chosen to perform probabilistic seismic hazard analysis and select hazard-consistent ground motion record sets adopting the seismicity model used for the calculation of the Italian national seismic hazard map currently in place. Expected annual loss was used as a performance parameter to quantify the seismic vulnerability of the school buildings. Furthermore, the results of the detailed loss estimation were compared with the outcome of the seismic risk classification guidelines, recently introduced in Italy, applied to these same buildings. Finally, this paper presents a preliminary extension of the results to estimate the seismic risk of school buildings of the same typologies if located throughout the Italian territory.",Assessing seismic risk in typical Italian school buildings: From in-situ survey to loss estimation,2020,School buildings  Loss estimation  Seismic assessment  Vulnerability  Retrofit,DAMAGE ASSESSMENT  FRAGILITY CURVES  MODEL,0,1
12621,"With 6.5 million households in the United States located in areas prone to storm surge, assessing the vulnerability of structures and residential communities to coastal flooding is an important concern. Of particular interest is understanding how the performance of structures during surge events is influenced by flood conditions, coastal defenses, and building design at both the house and community level. This study presents such a vulnerability analysis by investigating the impact of coastal flooding from Hurricane Sandy (2012) on 95 km of developed coastline across New Jersey and New York. Exterior structural damage observed from a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) aerial survey of the study area is related to (1) a hindcast simulation of flood inundation and wave action, (2) a classification of coastal defenses and storm-induced erosion, and (3) minimum building design elevations specified in FEMA’s flood hazard mapping. Findings indicate that the hardest hit communities experienced significant dune erosion, which coincided with severe flood and wave exposure. Furthermore, structures were considerably more susceptible to flood impact if Sandy’s flood level exceeded FEMA’s 100-year Base Flood Elevation dictating building design. These results are quantified by developing fragility curves relating both house and community-level performance to the considered vulnerability parameters. Findings from this study can be used to inform decision making for improving coastal resilience. © 2018 Hatzikyriakou and Lin.",Assessing the vulnerability of structures and residential communities to storm surge: An analysis of flood impact during hurricane sandy,2018,Base Flood Elevation  Community  Dune  Federal Emergency Management Agency  Flood  Hurricane Sandy  Storm surge  Structural vulnerability,None,0,1
12625,"Slow-moving landslides are a natural hazard which affects wide areas in the world and often are cause of significant damage to structures and infrastructures. Analysis of landslide evolution and of their interaction with existing man-made structures plays a key role in risk prevention and mitigation activities. To this purpose, a considerable interest towards innovative approaches has grown among the scientific community and land management institutions. In this work, Synthetic Aperture Radar data acquired by C-band and X-band sensors, combined with numerical analyses, have been successfully applied as a tool to detect spatial and temporal landslide-induced effects, in terms of deformations and structural behavior of a building affected by ground instability. Such approach has been applied to Moio della Civitella urban settlement (Salerno province, Italy), whose whole territory is interested by several slow-moving landslides. In detail, performance of a masonry building aggregate and the efficacy of restoration works have been investigated through an integrated assessment of displacement time-series pre- and post-repair intervention, and structural analysis performed with numerical code. Historical DInSAR data have permitted firstly the interpretation of building displacement time-series corresponding to pre- and post-works configurations; subsequently, the analysis of interpolated interferometric products has allowed to define gradient maps of vertical and horizontal displacements and to identify part of aggregate which can suffer a greater susceptibility to damage as a consequence of deformation gradients. Finally, the comparison of satellite and numerical data showed a substantial agreement with local failures and damage surveyed, thus confirming the capability of DInSAR technique to investigate building performance where no in situ displacement measurements were available.",Assessment of building behavior in slow-moving landslide-affected areas through DInSAR data and structural analysis,2019,Slow-moving landslides  Building damage  Displacement monitoring  DInSAR,VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT  DAMAGE ASSESSMENT  DEFORMATION  INTERFEROMETRY  MAPS,0,1
12629,"A methodology is developed for first-order assessment of the seismic risk involving seismic hazard, local building inventory, and evaluation of respective vulnerability. Central to the vulnerability analysis is the concept of fragility functions used to determine the probability of exceedance of a specified damage state, where the nonlinear structural behaviour is defined by capacity curves. A new set of continuous hazard-compatible fragility functions is proposed for rapid risk assessment on urban and regional scales in interactive spreadsheet application. To demonstrate the method, it was applied in a dense urban environment of downtown Quebec City, Canada, for damage assessment of low-rise wood light frame and unreinforced brick masonry buildings. Earthquake scenario with M6.2 and distance 10 km from the centroid of the study area was developed from deaggregation of the seismic hazard defined by the current National Building Code of Canada-NBCC 2010. The ground shaking was represented with a simplified site-specific response spectrum, fully defined with spectral accelerations at 0.3 and 1.0 s. The results show that as much as 61% of the considered buildings would sustain certain degree of damage. The influence of epistemic uncertainties in the ground motion prediction and the site-class on damage estimation is evaluated. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

12631,"Seismic vulnerability evaluations of buildings and critical infrastructure in densely populated cities strongly rely on fragility curves to estimate the probability of reaching or exceeding a given state of damage. Currently, however, the predicting capabilities of these models is limited. This paper presents a critical study of the accuracy of fragility curves for buildings, urban bridges, tunnels, overpasses, main roads, avenues and metro stations, aiming at establishing its advantages and shortcomings, when using them in seismic vulnerability and resilience assessments. Data gathered from one of the most damage areas during the 7.1 Mw September Mexico-Puebla 2017 earthquake was used in this study. Measured peak ground accelerations, PGA, and permanent ground deformations, PGD, along with appropriate fragility curves were used to establish the probability of having minor, moderate, large damage or collapse of buildings and critical infrastructure components. The damage on the study area documented during field reconnaissance was compared to that which would have been predicted using the fragility curves. Although in some cases, there was a good agreement between predicted and observed damage, overall it was clearly identified the need for developing fragility models that account for soil-structure interaction, and specific structural and ground conditions, to ensure a more reliable risk characterization of the City building stock and infrastructure during an earthquake. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Assessment of fragility models based on the Sept 19th, 2017 earthquake observed damage",2019,Mexico city  Seismic fragility curves  Seismic vulnerability,Critical infrastructures  Curves (road)  Earthquakes  Soil structure interactions  Subway stations  Fragility curves  Ground conditions  Mexico City  Peak ground acceleration  Permanent ground deformation  Risk characterization  Seismic fragility curves  Seismic vulnerability  Damage detection  critical analysis  earthquake damage  earthquake event  ground conditions  peak acceleration  risk assessment  soil-structure interaction  structural response  vulnerability  Federal District [Mexico]  Mexico City  Mexico [North America],0,1
12651,"Unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings that are characterized by brittle, heterogeneous, and anisotropic responses have complex nonlinear dynamic behavior and high vulnerability under seismic loading. While masonry confined by tie-columns and lintel beams can achieve better ductility and stability, the wall openings induce stress concentration around the corners and diminish the strength. Furthermore, the interacting in-plane and out-of-plane responses of masonry walls could significantly affect the post-cracking behavior and increase the collapse risk. To attain reliable seismic design of confined masonry buildings with openings, the collapse fragility under bi-directional seismic loading shall be addressed and thoroughly investigated in this study. Advanced discrete finite element models (DFEM) with coupled damage-plasticity traction-separation law, which can simulate complex nonlinear dynamic behavior such as disintegration and progressive collapse, were developed for the masonry structures and validated against experimental results. Four one-storey residential masonry buildings: (1) unconfined (UCM), (2) confined by tie-columns at four building corners (CM-I), (3) confined by toothed tie-columns (CM-II), and (4) confined by toothed tie-columns and lintel beams (CM-III) were considered. A series of incremental dynamic analyses (IDA) with 15 bi-directional ground motions and fragility analyses were performed to investigate the dynamic characteristics, base shear, hysteresis behavior, failure mechanism, collapse probability, and exceedance probability for different drift limits were studied in-depth. CM-II with toothed tie-columns had the lowest collapse probability and fragility at different drift limit states. The introduction of lintel beams to CM-III lead to an increase of the storey-drift-based fragility compared to CM-II, as a result of the increased maximum base shear of CM-III with higher post-damage stiffness. The lintel beams also inflicted short-column effects on the tie-columns. Nevertheless, the lintel beams could delay the out-of-plane collapse of the masonry walls by shortening the effective wall arching length. In some cases, the CM-III could achieve better performances than CM-II even in terms of storey drifts. The response variations of CM-III to the changing of the non-intensity related ground motion parameters are also lower than CM-II. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Bi-directional collapse fragility assessment by DFEM of unreinforced masonry buildings with openings and different confinement configurations,2021,bi-directional response  confined masonry  discrete finite element modelling  fragility curves  incremental dynamic analysis  openings  toothed-tie column,Disintegration  Failure (mechanical)  Masonry construction  Masonry materials  Probability  Retaining walls  Seismic design  Seismology  Structural dynamics  Bi-directional ground motions  Complex nonlinear dynamics  Dynamic characteristics  Exceedance probability  Ground motion parameters  Incremental dynamic analysis  Traction-separation law  Unreinforced masonry building  Walls (structural partitions),0,1
12654,"Passive control systems, such as buckling restrained braces (BRBs), have emerged as an efficient tool for the seismic response control of new and existing structures by providing strength and stiffness to buildings, in addition to high and stable energy dissipation capacity. Systems equipped with BRBs have been widely investigated in literature, however, only deterministic description of the BRBs' properties is usually considered. These properties are provided by the manufacturer and are successively validated by qualification control tests. The acceptance criteria specified by codal standards allows for some variation in the response of a single BRB by introducing a tolerance limit. Therefore, the 'real' properties of these devices could differ from the design values. This difference can affect the seismic response and potentially lead to an undesired seismic performance at the global level. This paper provides some preliminary insights on the influence of the BRBs' uncertainty on the seismic response of a retrofitted RC frame. For the case-study, a benchmark two-dimensional RC frame is considered. A single retrofit condition is analyzed and the BRBs' uncertainty is defined according to the tolerance limits of devices' quality control tests. Cloud analysis and probabilistic seismic demand models are used to develop fragility functions for four different damage states. Fragility curves are defined for the bare and retrofitted frame while considering both the design and the 'real' values of the BRBs properties. The preliminary results show that the BRBs' uncertainty could lead to an increase of the vulnerability up to 26.80% for the considered case-study. © 13th International Conference on Applications of Statistics and Probability in Civil Engineering, ICASP 2019.

12658,"Objectives: The building collapse is the main cause of casualties and economic losses in all kinds of disasters. Accurate assessment of the collapse of buildings is an important basis for disaster rescue and government decision-making, and plays an important role in the proper placement of the victims, the protection of the lives and property of the victims. Therefore, the rapid assessment of building collapse after disaster is a research hotspot in the field of remote sensing and civil engineering. The main objectives of this study was to apply the deep learning technology to automatically identify and assess building collapse and structural damage with on-site images. Methods: The building collapse assessment method used in this paper is ResNet (residual network). A ResNet-50 architecture was implemented in TensorFlow, which consists of 5 stages each with a convolution and identity block, 3 convolution layers in each convolution block and 3 convolution layers in each identity block. According to the building damage assessment standard developed by the China Earthquake Administration, the evaluation output of this model is adjusted to three types: Completely collapsed, semi-collapsed, and non-collapse. In the data augmentation process, geometry transformation and blur processing were used to simulate different shooting environments, to reduce the overfitting of the classifier model by enhancing the training image. Through data expansion, the number of training data has been increased by at least 10 times on the basis of PEER Hub ImageNet Challenge open dataset. In the process of transfer learning, the gradient descent algorithm was used to adjust and optimize the parameters of the neural network. The results of this method were evaluated by using accuracy and Kappa coefficient.Results: Finally, in the building collapse assessment experiment, the classification accuracy of the assessment model reached 77.23% and the Kappa coefficient was 0.65; in the structural damage assessment experiment, the classification accuracy of the assessment model reached 77% and the Kappa coefficient was 0.693.The proposed collapse classification successfully attains a relatively high rate for true-positives.Overall, this method performed well. This method shows great promise in supporting on-site decision-making for the rapid accurate assessment of building collapse after disaster.Conclusions: A novel automatic classification method for post-disaster building collapse evaluation is proposed, which meets the building damage evaluation standard.

12661,"Sudden-onset natural and man-made disasters represent a threat to the safety of human life and property. Rapid and accurate building damage assessment using bitemporal high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images can quickly and safely provide us with spatial distribution information and statistics of the damage degree to assist with humanitarian assistance and disaster response. For building damage assessment, strong feature representation and semantic consistency are the keys to obtaining a high accuracy. However, the conventional object-based image analysis (OBIA) framework using a patch-based convolutional neural network (CNN) can guarantee semantic consistency, but with weak feature representation, while the Siamese fully convolutional network approach has strong feature representation capabilities but is semantically inconsistent. In this paper, we propose a deep object-based semantic change detection framework, called ChangeOS, for building damage assessment. To seamlessly integrate OBIA and deep learning, we adopt a deep object localization network to generate accurate building objects, in place of the superpixel segmentation commonly used in the conventional OBIA framework. Furthermore, the deep object localization network and deep damage classification network are integrated into a unified semantic change detection network for end-to-end building damage assessment. This also provides deep object features that can supply an object prior to the deep damage classification network for more consistent semantic feature representation. Object-based post-processing is adopted to further guarantee the semantic consistency of each object. The experimental results obtained on a global scale dataset including 19 natural disaster events and two local scale datasets including the Beirut port explosion event and the Bata military barracks explosion event show that ChangeOS is superior to the currently published methods in speed and accuracy, and has a superior generalization ability for man-made disasters.",Building damage assessment for rapid disaster response with a deep object-based semantic change detection framework: From natural disasters to man-made disasters,2021,Building damage assessment  Change detection  Disaster response  Deep learning  Remote sensing  OBIA,None,0,1

12678,"A new methodology, Robust Simulation, has been developed for seismic risk assessment of geographically-distributed groups of buildings or other assets (portfolios) based on simulations that follow coherent epistemic tracks through the logic trees that are used to manage epistemic uncertainty. The ensembles of outputs preserve and display the uncertainty that results from the use of multiple models of seismicity, ground motion attenuation and building damage, presenting a more transparent and comprehensive view of risk. In this paper, a residential portfolio in California is modeled with ground motion simulations that conform to the USGS National Seismic Hazard Mapping Project [Petersen et al., 2014], with three different damage models-HAZUS [Kircher et al., 1997], Code-Oriented Damage Assessment, or CODA [Graf & Lee, 2009] and Wood Frame Single Family Dwelling [Wesson et al., 2004]. We compare the ensemble of solutions obtained through Robust Simulation with those found using conventional portfolio seismic risk methods (e.g., a single ""mean"" solution from a conventional catastrophe model) to reveal the importance of considering epistemic uncertainty. © Copyright (2018 by Earthquake Engineering Research Institute All rights reserved.",Catastrophe loss modeling through robust simulation,2018,None,Disasters  Earthquake effects  Earthquake engineering  Engineering geology  Historic preservation  Housing  Risk assessment  Uncertainty analysis  Catastrophe model  Damage assessments  Distributed groups  Epistemic uncertainties  Ground-motion attenuations  Ground-motion simulation  Robust simulations  Seismic risk assessment  Damage detection,0,1
12680,"Coastal settlements worldwide have suffered significant damage and loss to tsunami hazards in the last few decades. This period coincides with socio-economic changes that have heightened spatio-temporal risk through increased coastal development and infrastructure. In this study, we apply a spatio-temporal loss model to quantify the changes in direct economic losses to residential buildings from tsunami hazards over a 20-year period in Omaha Beach, New Zealand. The approach reconstructed temporal urban settlement patterns (1992, 1996, 2006 and 2012) for an area potentially exposed to regional source tsunami inundation hazard. Synthetic depth-damage functions for specific building classes were applied to estimate temporal damage and loss from tsunami inundation exposure at each building location. Temporal loss estimates were reported for a range of risk metrics, including probable maximum loss, loss exceedance and average annual loss. The results showed that an increase in the number of buildings and changes to building design (i.e., storeys, floor area, foundations) influenced the increasing risk to direct economic loss over the study period. These increases were driven by conversion from rural to urban land use since 1996. The spatio-temporal method presented in this study can be adapted to analyse changing risk patterns and trends for coastal settlements to inform future tsunami mitigation measures and manage direct economic losses.","Changes in Tsunami Risk to Residential Buildings at Omaha Beach, New Zealand",2019,tsunami hazard  coastal development  building attributes  synthetic vulnerability functions  direct economic losses  spatio-temporal risk changes,FLOOD DAMAGE ESTIMATION  FRAGILITY CURVES  VULNERABILITY  CHALLENGES  MODEL,0,1
12682,"Floods are the most devastating natural hazards in the United States, and these events lead to significant economic consequences. Estimation of damages and losses at different parts of the floodplain can be used to identify the vulnerable areas susceptible to flood. Floodplain maps combined with damage assessment could identify high-flood-risk areas and present a platform to develop guidelines and zoning resolutions for proper land use, building new infrastructures, and placing and retracting residential areas. In this study, a risk-based methodology is proposed to quantitatively assess damages. For this purpose, a geographic information system 04016016-based approach is used as an alternative to more complex software packages. The system is called a flood-damage estimator (FDE) and utilizes empirical synthetic depth-damage functions, land-use data, digital elevation model (DEM), raster maps (for featuring the characteristics of the properties at flood risk areas), and floodplain extent for the region in order to estimate flood damage. The results from this model are compared with the results of flood hazard analysis module in the FEMA HAZard United States (HAZUS) software. This model uses different characteristics, such as ground elevation and storm surge elevations to estimate flood damages and losses. In both models, a 100-year floodplain proposed by the FEMA flood insurance studies (FISs) of 2007 and 2013, as well as floodplain developed by the gridded surface subsurface hydrologic analysis (GSSHA)-distributed hydrologic model, are used to determine the flood water depth at different locations. This hydrologic model provides input from simultaneous consideration of inland and coastal flooding to the damage estimation model. The proposed methodology is applied to Manhattan. The results show the significant value of combining GIS-based models with damage-risk analysis to provide a flexible and simple platform for damage estimation as an alternative to the HAZUS model. Flood-risk maps created based on the damage estimation are of great use and importance in proper planning for land use and setting priorities for allocation of financial resources in recovery and reconstruction plans. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Coastal flood damage estimator: An alternative to FEMA's HAZUS platform,2016,Coastal flood  FEMA flood insurance study (FIS)  Flood damage  Flood-risk maps  Geographic information system (GIS)  Gridded surface subsurface hydrologic analysis (GSSHA)  HAZard United States (HAZUS),Banks (bodies of water)  Flood damage  Flood insurance  Geographic information systems  Hazards  Information systems  Information use  Land use  Maps  Risk analysis  Risk assessment  Risk perception  Surveying  Coastal floods  Digital elevation model  Distributed hydrologic model  Economic consequences  FEMA flood insurance study (FIS)  Flood risk maps  Hydrologic analysis  Hydrologic modeling  Damage detection  digital elevation model  flood damage  GIS  hazard assessment  hydrological modeling  land use  raster  risk assessment  United States,0,1
12687,"Study of collapse-resisting properties of structures has attracted widespread attention because of frequently occurring earthquakes and extreme events (e.g. blast) around the world. The developments in computational methods have enabled researchers to numerically simulate the collapse of structures under different kinds of loadings and provide reliable assessments of the collapse performance of structures. The dynamic nature of structural collapse requires a direct integration algorithm to solve the equations of motion of the numerical simulation model. A major concern in such simulations is the computational efficiency, which stems from the need to use a small time step size in both implicit algorithm and explicit algorithm. In this paper, modeling techniques to simulate typical failure mechanisms in reinforced concrete frame structures combined with the application of the recently developed explicit, unconditionally stable, parametrically dissipative KR-alpha integration method to investigate collapse simulation are presented. A fiber beam-column element is used to model the frame members, where the material nonlinearities, especially material softening, are simulated by a plastic damage model combined with a failure criterion. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the proposed collapse simulation technique. The results indicate that the proposed technique provides an accurate result and has exceptional computational efficiency.

12695,"Recent seismic events produced considerable socio-economic losses. An important step for the reduction and mitigation of seismic risk in urban areas with a high population density is the assessment of global vulnerability of clustered buildings. The proposed work aims at appraising the seismic vulnerability of building aggregates within the historical center of Arsita, damaged by the L'Aquila earthquake (2009 April 6th), through a multi-level approach deriving from the application of different estimation procedures. In particular, the seismic vulnerability quantification has been done by comparing three distinct methods, namely the macroseismic approach according to the EMS-98 scale, the Vulnus methodology, developed by the University of Padua, and the mechanical approach derived from using the 3Muri software. The expected damage has been estimated in terms of fragility curves, respectively, for the entire buildings compound and the individual structural units located in the corner and intermediate positions, in order to evaluate the beneficial or detrimental aggregate effect on the seismic behavior of individual constructions examined. © Copyright © 2019 Chieffo and Formisano.",Comparative Seismic Assessment Methods for Masonry Building Aggregates: A Case Study,2019,fragility curves  macroseismic method  masonry aggregates  mechanical method  non-linear analysis  vulnerability assessment  Vulnus method,None,0,1
12696,"After the 2010 Maule earthquake, Chilean authorities now require the implementation of base isolation systems in new public hospital build-ings. However, in Chile the typical seismic force-resisting system of non-isolated hospitals is made up of reinforced concrete shear walls, whereas that of isolated buildings is made up of reinforced concrete frames. Since the former is much stiffer than the latter, there is then a question on the actual effectiveness of base isolation in reducing the seismic demands on new hospitals with respect to that on conventional hospitals, particularly the interstory drift demand under relatively low levels of ground shaking. Motivated by this context, this study evaluates the main results of a comparative analysis of the seismic performance of isolated and non-isolated hospitals considering the typical structural system in each case. Representative structural layouts were defined for both types of hospital buildings based on the Chilean state of the practice. Further, possible influence of the number of stories was considered. Member sizes and isolation system properties were determined in accordance to the current Chilean seismic design codes. The structural models were subjected to nonlinear time history analyses under two simultaneous horizontal components of ground motions selected from the Chilean database of earthquake records. The seismic response was evaluated through fragility curves, which were developed from results given by incremental dynamic analysis. Several limit states associated with the isolation systems, structural elements and nonstructural components of hospitals were considered. Results are compared with empirical observations on the effects of earthquakes on the Chilean building inventory, and the suitability of limit state thresholds defined in the literature is discussed. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Comparative Seismic Fragility Analysis of Conventional and Base Isolated Hospital Buildings Having Different Structural Systems,2020,2010 Chile earthquake  base isolation  Fragility analysis  hospital buildings  incremental dynamic analysis,Concrete construction  Earthquakes  Reinforced concrete  Seismic design  Seismic response  Shear walls  Structural analysis  Base isolation systems  Incremental dynamic analysis  Non-structural components  Nonlinear time history analysis  Reinforced concrete frames  Reinforced concrete shear walls  Seismic fragility analysis  State of the practice  Hospitals,0,1
12697,"Superelastic viscous damper is a passive hybrid control device that combines shape memory alloy cables and a viscoelastic damper to mitigate dynamic response of structures subjected to multi-level seismic hazards. In the hybrid device, shape memory alloy cables that exhibit a nonlinear but elastic response are used mainly as re-centering unit, while the viscoelastic damper composed of high-damped butyl rubber compounds is employed to augment the equivalent viscous damping provided by the device. This study evaluates the effectiveness of superelastic viscous dampers in mitigating seismic response of steel frame structures through a probabilistic framework. First, a nine-story steel frame building is designed and modeled with and without superelastic viscous dampers, and extensive nonlinear response-history analyses are conducted. Then, probabilistic demand models are developed for selected engineering demand parameters. To quantitatively compare the performance of the designed buildings, seismic fragility curves and mean annual frequency of exceeding different performance levels are developed. In particular, the structural performance is evaluated using both peak inter-story drift and residual drift responses. Results indicate that superelastic viscous dampers can significantly improve structural performance; thus, it has the potential to lower the post-earthquake losses, as the better structural performance leads to less loss in relocation, rental, and economic loss. © The Author(s) 2018.",Comparative seismic fragility estimates of steel moment frame buildings with or without superelastic viscous dampers,2018,Fragility curves  high-damped butyl rubber  shape memory alloy  structural control,Cables  Losses  Rubber  Seismic response  Shape memory effect  Steel construction  Structural dynamics  Structural frames  Viscoelasticity  Butyl rubber  Engineering demand parameters  Equivalent viscous damping  Fragility curves  Nonlinear response history analysis  Probabilistic framework  Seismic fragility curves  Structural control  Structural analysis,0,1
12698,"The serious consequences of the last tsunamis that occurred in India in 2004 and in Japan in 2011 have attracted the attention of engineers and specialists in order to develop tools to calculate, to verify and to assess the vulnerability of buildings against this devastating disaster. The objective of the present work is to establish a comparative study of the behavior of metallic structures and the ones of reinforced concrete under the effect of the forces generated by the tsunami waves. For this purpose, a simplified modeling of tsunamic forces has been established on the basis of experimental models expressing the intensity of these forces as a function of time. Then, the time history methods and the Pushover analysis have been combined in order to establish the capacity curves. Then, the vulnerability criteria of each one of the studied structures have been determined under the effect of the tsunamic solicitations. This will evaluate the performance of both materials based on the different degrees of damage recorded. Thanks to the simplified modeling of the tsunami forces proposed in this comparative study, it has been possible to perform the time history analysis of the two types of structures. The result obtained can be used for the benefit of the concerned officials in the design and programming of the development plans of the highly exposed coastal cities and to establish a judicious choice of the types of materials adapted to this kind of disaster.

12699,"A loss and damage assessment was performed for the buildings of Lorca, Spain, considering an earthquake hazard scenario with similar characteristics to those of a real event which occurred on May 11th, 2011, in terms of epicentre, depth and magnitude while also considering the local soil response. This low-to moderate earthquake caused severe damage and disruption in the region and especially on the city. A building by building resolution database was developed and used for damage and loss assessment. The portfolio of buildings was characterized by means of indexes capturing information from a structural point of view such as age, main construction materials, number of stories, and building class as well as others related to age and vulnerability classes. A replacement cost approach was selected for the analysis in order to calculate the direct losses incurred by the event. Seismic hazard and vulnerability were modelled in a probabilistic way, considering their inherent uncertainties which were also taken into account in the damage and loss calculation process. Losses have been expressed in terms of the mean damage ratio of each dwelling and since the analysis has been performed on a geographical information system platform, the distribution of the damage and its categories was mapped for the entire urban centre. The simulated damages and losses were compared with the observed ones reported by the local authorities and institutions that inspected the city after the event. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Comparing observed damages and losses with modelled ones using a probabilistic approach: The Lorca 2011 case,2016,CAPRA  Comparison of losses  Model calibration and validation  Probabilistic seismic hazard analysis  Probabilistic seismic risk assessment,None,0,1
12700,"The main aim of this study is to assess the seismic behavior of various knee braced steel frames using nonlinear static and dynamic analyses. For this, structures with four different types of knee braces at heights of 5, 10, 15 and 20 stories are designed through ETABS and then are three-dimensionally modeled via PERFORM 3D. Firstly, various seismic parameters including response modification factor, ductility factor, deflection amplification factor and overstrength factor of the structures are compared via implementing the pushover analysis. Secondly, target models are subjected to five far-fault and five near-fault records. Fragility curves as well as curves obtained from the incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) are then compared, so as to determine the best type of bracing in terms of seismic performance. Benefiting results of non-linear static analyses, top knee, x-knee, chevron knee and double knee braced frames have the best seismic performance, respectively. Likewise, using IDA results in the far-fault area, x-knee, top knee, chevron knee and double-knee braced frames demonstrate the best performance, respectively. In addition, in near-field area at the height of 5 stories, the best performance is correspondingly attributed to x-knee, top-knee, chevron knee and double knee braces, respectively.

12704,"In this study, manual and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) surveys of physical damage to structures in Ortley Beach, New Jersey, following Hurricane Sandy are used to assess the vulnerability of residential structures to storm surge. First, using photographs from the manual survey, the performance of building components prone to surge damage (foundations, exterior walls, and wall siding) is assessed according to failure mechanism, construction type, and material. General observations include widespread failure of closed foundations, significant vulnerability of exterior walls to surge loads and waterborne debris impact, and the extensive loss of vinyl lap siding. The effect of the built environment is also investigated, revealing that the study area consists of two regions: one heavily damaged due to the failure of coastal dunes and another partially protected by large oceanfront structures acting as artificial breakwaters. The performance of individual structures is likewise found to strongly influence the performance of nearby buildings, either by shielding inland structures from surge loads or by generating damaging waterborne debris. Next, a statistical analysis of various vulnerability parameters characterizing structures and the built environment reveals that the distance of buildings from the coast is the most significant damage predictor, with additional factors such as house age and elevation off the ground also affecting component performance. Vulnerability curves and vulnerability surfaces giving the probability of component failure as functions of these significant vulnerability parameters are then developed across different surge environments, component types, and failure mechanisms, providing a quantification of the observed damage features. Fragility curves are also developed to depict the severity of waterborne debris impact. Finally, using airborne and mobile LiDAR surveys, a method for rapidly assessing foundation failure by detecting changes in a structure's location is proposed and validated for Ortley Beach. Applying this method to other New Jersey communities experiencing a similar surge (Seaside Heights and Normandy Beach), overall coastal performance is found to largely reflect the failure mode of the community's dunes. This study presents a framework for rigorously understanding storm surge impact through improved survey methods, assessment procedures, and statistical analyses.

12716,"The hydrodynamic effects of flooding during extreme storm events are the leading cause of structural damage to impacted properties and due to their complexity, it is difficult to accurately estimate structural damage and flood vulnerability. We propose a robust structural damage assessment model that considers the dynamic behavior of flooding coupled with the structural and regional characteristics of buildings by using of a pair hydrodynamic model i.e., the advanced circulation (ADCIRC) and two-dimensional unsteady flow (TUFLOW). Fine-scale inland flooding scenarios were developed to simulate heavily impacted areas of coastal New Jersey in the United States (US) based on the historical storm Hurricane Sandy (2012). The models were calibrated and validated using multiple sets of observed data as well as using several performance metrics. The corresponding Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and R-squared (R2) values were found to be in the range of 0.426–0.81 and 0.56–0.91, respectively, during the ADCIRC calibration process. A spatial comparison with the observed inundation data revealed that the correlation coefficient and root mean square error (RMSE) for the inland flood modelling by TUFLOW were 0.79 and 0.71, respectively, with a 96.49% coefficient of similarity. A structural damage model was developed by combining the hydrodynamic components of flooding with several structural characteristics. In a comparison of the observed and model-simulated damage counts, the results indicate the conservative nature of the damage-prediction model with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 40.26 and RMSE of 58.67.

12732,"This paper proposes a dynamic structural health monitoring and damage detection method to assess the structural integrity and safety of an RC framed building with masonry infills. The effectiveness of the method is verified by numerical analyses that were performed on a RC moment-resisting frame structure investigated by Paultre et al. and applied on an existing RC framed building with masonry infill walls, which provide a strong contribution to the dynamic response and seismic performance of the building. Different damage states are simulated through the nonlinear static (pushover) analysis developed by the FE model of the building, and this analysis considers both the bare framed structure and the infilled structure to appraise the damage to the infill walls. The identification and location of the damage is estimated using the modal properties of the damaged building at various steps of the nonlinear analysis. The results highlight the different evolutions of the damage in the bare and infilled frames and the possibility of detection via dynamic monitoring. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Damage assessment of an existing RC infilled structure by numerical simulation of the dynamic response,2019,Damage detection  Dynamic identification  Masonry infill walls  RC framed buildings,Dynamic response  Infill drilling  Masonry materials  Nonlinear analysis  Numerical methods  Structural frames  Structural health monitoring  Walls (structural partitions)  Damage assessments  Different evolutions  Dynamic identification  Dynamic monitoring  Framed buildings  Masonry infills  Moment resisting frames  Seismic Performance  Damage detection,0,1
12760,"Seismic risk mitigation at national scale requires the vulnerability assessment of the built stock, which is generally based on the definition of appropriate fragility curves by means of different methods. A first type of methods uses an empirical approach with calibration from observed damage. A second group of methods uses mechanical models suitable to describe the structural behavior; however, because an in-depth geometric and structural characterization of the buildings is very time-consuming at the territorial level, these models must remain “as simple as possible” to limit the number of input parameters. The aim of this work is to estimate the fragility of the Italian masonry buildings stock grouped in macro-typologies ISTAT (National Institute of Statistics), i.e. defined by construction age and number of stories; this is essential for deriving damage scenarios at territorial scale based solely on ISTAT information. Vulnus Vb 4.0 (2009), a software developed at the University of Padova, was found to be very useful for this purpose as it provides fragility curves of masonry buildings assessing the in-plane (IP) failure, the principal out-of-plane (OOP) mechanisms and the main typological-structural characteristics; judgments on the quality of information are also used to provide an upper and lower fragility limit. More than 500 buildings were examined with this software, appropriately chosen to guarantee a good statistical representation of the built stock. The information for each building was retrieved directly from the related projects and, in the case of missing information, reference was made to design manuals and codes, and to specific literature. Finally, the fragility results were processed to provide a mean fragility curve (representing the trigger of an IP - OOP mechanism) and a range of possible dispersion for each ISTAT macro-typology. These results can also be used to calibrate macro-seismic models of vulnerability in the literature, if the will is to represent this mechanical fragility in a more distributed way, i.e. with more damage states.

12765,"In seismic analysis of building, infill wall is usually modelled as non-structural elements and, hence, are not taken into account in analytical models. In general, engineers and scientists model these widely used structural system of masonry infilled reinforced concrete frame by considering the infill wall as load applied to the open confining frame. The presence of masonry infills, however, may significantly alter both the stiffness and the strength of the overall structural frame system. This present study aims to evaluate seismic performance of this type of building by developing fragility functions of the structure. Masonry wall was modelled as diagonal strut within the concrete frame. The masonry constituents and its composite properties were determined for the model. Then, the structure was subjected to incremental static lateral loading while adaptive pushover analysis was utilized to predict the response of the structure. As the damage states were defined from the spectral capacity curves, the fragility functions were developed for the structure. Effect of masonry wall included in the analysis was then compared to the results of open frame. The result of the eigen value analysis shows, the period for modelling a structure with an infill wall is smaller compared to modelling a structure without infill wall (open frame). This shows that the existence of infill wall elements in modelling increases the value of structural stiffness so that it reduces the period of the structure. Whereas, the results of the fragility curve in both structural modelling show that at some level of damage, the probability of damage for modelling structures with infill walls is smaller when compared to open frame. Realistic and rational results is presented in this work which show that modelling masonry wall with compression strut is beneficial. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Determining fragility of urban low-to-mid rise masonry infilled building,2019,None,Infill drilling  Masonry construction  Reinforced concrete  Retaining walls  Seismology  Stiffness  Structural analysis  Struts  Composite properties  Compression struts  Non-structural elements  Push-over analysis  Reinforced concrete frames  Seismic Performance  Structural modelling  Structural stiffness  Walls (structural partitions),0,1
12770,"Seismic isolation technique is increasingly used both for the design of new buildings and for the seismic retrofit of existing buildings. Nevertheless, so far, little attention has been paid on the collapse capacity of these structures, mainly because it requires refined nonlinear models and careful consideration of different sources of uncertainties. To fill this gap, a set of collapse fragility functions for existing reinforced concrete-frame buildings, designed for gravity loads only and then retrofitted with different isolation systems (including rubber-based and friction-based isolation systems), are derived in this study. For completeness, buildings with low and high seismic resistance are also considered. Collapse fragility functions are derived through incremental dynamic analysis, considering different collapse conditions both for isolation system and superstructure. For each case study building, mean and dispersion values are obtained considering both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties, due to record-to record and model variability, respectively.

12776,"The present work proposes a fuzzy-random fragility assessment framework for evaluating 2D reinforced concrete moment frame buildings in the presence of various sources of uncertainty, most notably aleatory and epistemic. Such uncertainties exert a powerful influence on the nonlinear behavior of structural systems and consequently affect the seismic response of these structures. For this reason, a number of effective techniques including Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) simulation, fuzzy set theory, and a well-known α-cut approach have been used to quantify the median of the collapse fragility curve as the fuzzy-random response. As a major step in the α-cut approach, metaheuristic evolutionary algorithms including modified genetic algorithm (MGA), and a novel global optimization algorithm inspired by Mouth Brooding Fish (MBF) in nature have been adopted to explore the maximum and minimum of such median in each membership degree, α. The results demonstrate that the merit of new MBF algorithm is its greater efficiency in specifying the α-cut boundaries compared with MGA. Herein, for the sake of more simplicity and efficiency, a new equation is proposed for the prediction of the median of collapse fragility curve of the case-study building, using the gene expression programming (GEP) methodology. This median is formulated in terms of several effective parameters such as steel modulus of elasticity Es, steel yield stress fy, and concrete strength f′ c, which regarded as the input fuzzy-random variables. The performance and validity of the GEP model are further tested using several criteria. The results indicate that analyzing the proposed GEP model in terms of fuzzy-random variables thru the MBF algorithm significantly improves efficiency and reduces computational time by 75%. © 2020",Developing the seismic fragility analysis with fuzzy random variables using Mouth Brooding Fish algorithm,2020,Fuzzy sets  Genetic expression programming  Modified genetic algorithm  Mouth Brooding Fish algorithm  Seismic fragility analysis  Uncertainty,Computation theory  Efficiency  Fish  Fuzzy set theory  Fuzzy sets  Gene expression  Genetic algorithms  Global optimization  Random variables  Reinforced concrete  Seismic response  Uncertainty analysis  Yield stress  Gene expression programming  Genetic Expression Programming  Global optimization algorithm  Latin hypercube sampling  Modified genetic algorithms  Seismic fragility analysis  Sources of uncertainty  Uncertainty  Computational efficiency,0,1
12796,"In this study, strong ground motion record (SGMR) selection based on Eta (eta) as a spectral shape indicator has been investigated as applied to steel braced frame structures. A probabilistic seismic hazard disaggregation analysis for the definition of the target Epsilon (epsilon) and the target Eta (eta) values at different hazard levels is presented, taking into account appropriately selected SGMR's. Fragility curves are developed for different limit states corresponding to three representative models of typical steel braced frames having significant irregularities in plan, by means of a weighted damage index. The results show that spectral shape indicators have an important effect on the predicted median structural capacities, and also that the parameter eta is a more robust predictor of damage than searching for records with appropriate epsilon values.","Development of fragility curves by incorporating new spectral shape indicators and a weighted damage index: case study of steel braced frames in the city of Mashhad, Iran",2017,vulnerability  spectral shape indicator  incremental dynamic analysis  damage index  hazard disaggregation  record selection,SEISMIC COLLAPSE ASSESSMENT  INTENSITY MEASURE  BUILDINGS  MODEL,0,1
12799,"A single intensity measure (IM) is commonly used to develop fragility curves for structures subjected to mainshock-aftershock (MS-AS) scenarios. This study aims to propose a framework to develop MS-AS fragility surfaces by characterizing the MS-AS sequences with two IMs. To do this, the well-known Park & Ang damage index, which increases monotonically with the ground motion duration, is adopted to represent the accumulative structural damage during sequential excitations. The MS-AS accumulative damage of structures is thus represented by the combination of the initial damage caused by MS and the incremental damage caused by AS. Based on total probability theorem, the process of assessing MS-AS fragility is consequently divided into two parts, namely the MS fragility assessment and the AS fragility assessment, respectively, where the cases of dynamic instability are considered. The proposed framework is illustrated using a typical four-story reinforced concrete frame building. The peak ground velocity values of both MS and AS are taken as the representative IMs for the MS-AS sequences. The fragility results for MS only and MS-AS sequences are compared to scrutinize the effects of AS on structural damage. It is found that the MS-AS sequence can cause significantly larger exceedance probabilities of limit states compared to the MS only. The MS-AS sequence also leads to a reduction of the MS-AS fragility median conditioned on a given AS intensity. Such reduction increases with the increase of the AS intensity. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Development of fragility surfaces for reinforced concrete buildings under mainshock-aftershock sequences,2021,damage accumulation  fragility surface  mainshock-aftershock sequence  RC frame  total probability theorem,Concrete buildings  Concrete construction  Damage detection  Earthquakes  Structural analysis  Accumulative damage  Aftershock sequence  Dynamic instability  Exceedance probability  Fragility assessment  Peak ground velocity  Reinforced concrete frame buildings  Total probabilities  Reinforced concrete,0,1
12805,"Concrete buildings reinforced by plain bars are one of the special types of old structures generally built before the 1970s. According to the experiences of earthquakes and experimental tests, the dominant damage mode in these structures includes a deep crack at the intersection of the beam with the joint panel zone. In this study, seismic fragility curves of existing concrete buildings reinforced by plain bars were investigated by means of incremental dynamic analysis and by consideration of soil-type effects and construction quality effects. A relatively simple and efficient non-linear model based on the experimental behaviour of exterior and interior joints of the represented building is used to simulate pre- and post-elastic behaviour of the joints which fail under bar slippage mode. Two record sets were considered corresponding to the soil types C and D of the NEHRP provision. The results indicated that the seismic vulnerability of the represented building increases at all damage states as the type of soil changes from C to D. On average, the median capacity of the building is decreased by about 30% for the moderate limit state as the type of soil changes from C to D. Also, the normal distribution function with median data is the best distribution function for seismic fragility assessment of the represented building. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Development of seismic fragility curves for the existing RC building with plain bars,2020,beam-column joint  existing RC buildings  Fragility curve  incremental dynamic analysis  plain bars,Concrete buildings  Damage detection  Distribution functions  Normal distribution  Seismology  Soils  Construction quality  Elastic behaviour  Experimental test  Incremental dynamic analysis  Non-linear model  Seismic fragility  Seismic fragility curves  Seismic vulnerability  Reinforced concrete,0,1

The assessment of likely negative consequences is based on pre-populated databases of seismic, building inventory and vulnerability parameters. To further accelerate the computation for near real-time analyses, implicit building fragility curves were developed as functions of the magnitude and the intensity of the seismic shaking defined with a single intensity measure, input spectral acceleration at 1.0 s implicitly considering the epicentral distance and local soil conditions. Damage probabilities were compared with those obtained with the standard fragility functions explicitly considering epicentral distances and local site classes in addition to the earthquake magnitudes and respective intensity of the seismic shaking. Different seismic scenarios were considered first for 53 building classes common in Eastern Canada, and then a reduced number of 24 combined building classes was proposed. Comparison of results indicate that the damage predictions with implicit fragility functions for short (M ≤ 5.5) and medium strong motion duration (5.5 &lt; M ≤ 7.5) show low variation with distance and soil class, with average error of less than 3.6%. © 2018 by the authors.

Iran is one of the most seismically active countries in the world. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and analyze the extent of earthquake vulnerability in relation to demographic, environmental, and physical criteria. An earthquake risk assessment (ERA) map was created by using a Fuzzy-Analytic Hierarchy Process coupled with an Artificial Neural Networks (FAHP-ANN) model generating five vulnerability classes. Combining the application of a FAHP-ANN with a geographic information system (GIS) enabled to assign weights to the layers of the earthquake vulnerability criteria. The model was applied to Sanandaj City in Iran, located in the seismically active Sanandaj-Sirjan zone which is frequently affected by devastating earthquakes. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model was implemented in the IDRISI software and 250 points were validated for grades 0 and 1. The validation process revealed that the proposed model can produce an earthquake probability map with an accuracy of 95%. A comparison of the results attained by using a FAHP, AHP and MLP model shows that the hybrid FAHP-ANN model proved flexible and reliable when generating the ERA map. The FAHP-ANN model accurately identified the highest earthquake vulnerability in densely populated areas with dilapidated building infrastructure.

12837,"Although aftershocks have the potential to cause severe damage to buildings and threaten life safety, their effect in seismic risk analysis is not explicitly accounted for in modern building design codes, nor in emerging methodologies such as performance-based seismic design. The ultimate objective of this study is to systematically integrate aftershock hazard into performance-based earthquake engineering (PBEE) through analytical studies with structural degradation models derived from publicly available experimental data. In this paper, the first step is made by introducing a procedure to compute the probability of a mainshock-damaged woodframe building entering different damage states as a result of aftershock. Aftershock fragilities are developed by performing incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) using a sequence of mainshock-aftershock ground motions. To compute the seismic response of the damaged building, IDA is performed using a sequence of mainshocks of different intensity levels combined with random aftershocks. The variation in aftershock fragilities for each of the damage states for several different mainshock intensities is presented. The effect of the mainshock damage is to alter the fragilities and is quantified for the building investigated. It is observed that the fragility curves for collapse risk have a similar shape for the mainshock-aftershock sequences for different levels of mainshock. As well as that there was an unexpected result that, if the building model survives the mainshock, the additional collapse risk because of aftershocks may not be as critical as originally thought for engineered woodframe construction. The effect of aftershocks on damage states appears to be more significant, relatively speaking, than on collapse of low-rise woodframe buildings, indicating that including aftershock hazard on performance-based seismic design will be significant. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Effect of mainshock-aftershock sequences on woodframe building damage fragilities,2015,Aftershock fragilities  Collapse fragilities  Incremental dynamic analysis  Performance-based seismic design  Structural degradation models  Woodframe building,Architectural design  Hazards  Risk analysis  Risk assessment  Seismic design  Seismic response  Aftershock fragilities  Collapse fragilities  Incremental dynamic analysis  Performance based seismic design  Structural degradation  Woodframe buildings  Earthquakes,0,1
12838,"This study aims at determining the effect of masonry as an infill on the vulnerability of reinforced concrete frame buildings by using fragility assessment. Refined linear and nonlinear structural models were developed, from data collected through professional surveys, using the PERFORM-3D platform. Nonlinear–static and dynamic–analyses were carried out, for fifteen ground motions, to examine the plastic behavior of the models. Subsequently, the vulnerability was assessed using fragility relationships. The fragility parameters were determined by employing the Maximum Likelihood Method (MLM). The results indicated a decrease in the probability of exceedance for specific damage states of the structures with respect to seismic intensity for masonry infill frames. From fragility curves, it is concluded that although the use of masonry as an infill temporarily enhances the capacity of Reinforced Concrete (RC) Frame buildings as the probability of exceedance for masonry infilled RC frames is significantly reduced due to the increase in the overall stiffness of the structure. © 2021 Korea Institute for Structural Maintenance and Inspection.",Effect of masonry infill on analytical fragility response of RC frame school buildings in high seismic zone,2021,fragility curves  maximum likelihood method  Nonlinear analysis  vulnerability,None,0,1
12875,"Over the past 40 years, approximately 1/3 of the existing empirical fragility curves estimated the ground motion intensity at the needed locations from GMPEs. These studies typically ignored the error in the GMPE. This study develops a Bayesian methodology in order to explicitly model this source of uncertainty and assess its importance on the shape of the fragility curves. The methodology is used to construct empirical fragility curves for the least vulnerable Italian buildings using 7,439 data from the 1980 Irpinia database aggregated in 41 municipalities. Overall, the results do not show a systematic notable impact on the fragility curves for all examined damage states. Nonetheless, the shape of the fragility curves corresponding to the most extreme damage level (i.e., collapse) is substantially influenced by the explicit modelling of the uncertainty in ground motion intensity. © 2018 11th National Conference on Earthquake Engineering 2018, NCEE 2018: Integrating Science, Engineering, and Policy.

12884,"Fragility functions define the probability of meeting or exceeding some damage measure (DM) for a given level of engineering demand (e.g.,base shear) or hazard intensity measure (IM; e.g.,wind speed, and peak ground acceleration). Empirical fragility functions specifically refer to fragility functions that are developed from posthazard damage assessments, and, as such, they define the performance of structures or systems as they exist in use and under true natural hazard loading. This paper describes major sources of epistemic uncertainty in empirical fragility functions for building performance under natural hazard loading, and develops and demonstrates methods for quantifying these uncertainties using Monte Carlo simulation methods. Uncertainties are demonstrated using a dataset of 1,241 residential structures damaged in the May 22, 2011, Joplin, Missouri, tornado. Uncertainties in the intensity measure (wind speed) estimates were the largest contributors to the overall uncertainty in the empirical fragility functions. With a sufficient number of samples, uncertainties because of potential misclassification of the observed damage levels and sampling error were relatively small. The methods for quantifying uncertainty in empirical fragility functions are demonstrated using tornado damage observations, but are applicable to any other natural hazard as well.

12974,"Probabilistic assessment of seismic damage for an individual building or a building stock in terms of fragility curves generally requires utilization of ground motion records either seismologically consistent with the probable hazard for the area studied or chosen arbitrarily without considering the seismological characteristics, but covering a range of intensity levels. In both alternatives, the analyst should select several records to be able to perform the probabilistic studies accurately. This condition might not be always satisfied for regions where there are limited number of seismologically consistent records available or for cases when there are less number of records available for high intensity levels. To compensate for this, regional-specific stochastically simulated ground motions could be utilized. This study evaluates the suitability of simulated records in development of fragility curves for low- to mid-rise reinforced concrete moment-resisting frames sampled from existing buildings of Duzce, Turkey. The simulated records have been generated by using regional seismicity parameters of Duzce and employing stochastic finite-fault methodology. From the set of simulated records, a subset of 100 ground motion records have been selected to cover a wide range of ASI* values where ASI* is the modified version of ASI with 0.1-2.5 s range. To test the performance of the simulated records, a set of 'real' records compatible with the seismological characteristics of the region was selected from NGA-West2 ground motion database of PEER as well. Nonlinear time history analyses on multi-degree-of-freedom systems have been performed and fragility curves based on ASI*, PGV and HI have been developed.

12977,"In the conventional performance-based earthquake engineering framework, fragility curves are mapped to a function of story drift ratio or spectral acceleration corresponding to the first mode. Based on the fragility curves, the probability of structural healthy status can be estimated. Practically, it is difficult to measure story drift and expensive to develop an automative measuring system. Therefore, this paper strives to develop fragility curves by using wavelet-based refined damage-sensitive feature (rDSF), considering higher mode contributions. These fragility curves can be obtained from absolute acceleration responses recorded at each story of buildings. As irregularities have important and significant effects on behaviour and seismic performance of Moment Resisting Frames (MRFs) especially in the field of structural health monitoring, in the next step, we extend the fragility curves for irregular MRFs. To this end, an efficient and more precise rDSF using Morlet and cmorfb-fc wavelets are extended to map fragility curves. The correlation coefficient between rDSF and maximum story drift ratio is evaluated as a criterion to determine the effects of irregularity. The 6-story steel benchmark MRF was manufactured to consider a stiffness reduction irregularity caused by the deference in story height and ductility of beam-column members. To assemble rDSFs, acceleration responses recorded both from the regular and irregular MRFs were analyzed by using incremental dynamic analysis, subjected to different ground motion sets. Moreover, a system identification method is used to identify the natural frequencies of each MRF. Based on the acquired results, it can be concluded that the MRFs including higher first story and weak columns-strong beams changes with a higher probability of damages lead to damage occurrence at lower seismic intensities and also lower maximum story drift ratios as compared with those of reference MRF. Moreover, the results show that the fragility curves estimated by wavelets-based rDSF, especially by using cmorfb-fc wavelet-based rDSF, due to lower probability of damages (varied between 27% and 81% for different damage states) have more efficiency than the fragility curves derived from Morlet wavelet-based DSF, considering only the first mode, for all the MRFs of interest. Furthermore, global fragility curves lead to a total assessment of the MRFs, while for a more accurate damage diagnosis, the rDSF-base fragility curves computed for each story can be used. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Fragility curves for seismic damage assessment in regular and irregular MRFs using improved wavelet-based damage index,2021,Cmorfb-fc mother wavelet  Damage index  Fragility curve  Maximum story drift ratio  Regular and irregular MRFs  System identification method,Curve fitting  Earthquake engineering  Probability  Religious buildings  Seismology  Structural frames  Structural health monitoring  Acceleration response  Cmorfb-fc mother wavelet  Damage index  Damage-sensitive features  Drift ratio  Fragility curves  Maximum story drift ratio  Moment resisting frames  Regular and irregular moment resisting frame  System identification methods  Damage detection,0,1
12992,"Effects of different structural configurations, member orientations and standoff distances on blast-induced failure of steel frame buildings are investigated through development of fragility curves. Three steel frame buildings with different geometric configurations - square plan with rectangular shape in elevation, square plan with pyramidal shape in elevation, and semicircular plan with equal area at each floor level - are analyzed under blast load. The steel frame buildings are modeled, analyzed, and designed for dead load (DL), live load (LL) and seismic load (SL) for the National Capital Region (NCR), India. Force-controlled static nonlinear pushover analyses are performed to develop the fragility curves for the buildings under blast load. Different orientations of the columns (I-section) are considered to investigate the effect on building fragility under blast load. The results indicate significant effects of the structural configurations and column orientations on the blast resistance of the building.

13070,"This paper presents a study to statistically characterize the joint earthquake-snow hazard and subsequently develop maximum interstory drift fragility curves for a series of archetype engineered light-frame wood structures. Of particular focus are structures built in moderate-seismic, heavy-snow regions. For these light-frame structures, the additional seismic mass due to the presence of roof snow may be significant. Although load standards such as ASCE 7 provide guidance on combining design loads when considering life safety (e.g., flexural and shear limit states), guidance is not yet available for other performance levels (limit states with specified nonexceedance probabilities), performance (rather than safety) based limit states or damage indicators (e.g., maximum interstory drift), and hazard levels other than those implied in life safety design (e.g., 2%/50 years). All of these are expected to become more relevant as performance-based design procedures continue to evolve and gain acceptance. Using Boston and Stampede Pass, Washington, as study sites, snow loads and earthquake loads were modeled as stochastic processes and simulation was used to construct the joint snow-earthquake hazard contours from which the joint snow-earthquake hazard at different hazard levels could be characterized. One approach is proposed for the selection of appropriate companion load coincidence factors considering multiple hazards for use in performance-based design. Finally, peak interstory drift distributions and the seismic fragility curves at different joint hazard levels were developed for a set of archetype wood-frame structures. The results show that the current strength-based design procedures are not risk-consistent for these types of structures. As an alternative, recently developed displacement-based design procedures may provide a more risk-consistent design methodology. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Joint Earthquake-Snow Hazard Characterization and Fragility Analysis of Wood-Frame Structures,2016,Design  Earthquake  Fragility  Hazard  Performance-based design  Risk  Snow  Structural safety and reliability  Wood structures,Design  Earthquakes  Geophysics  Hazards  Random processes  Risks  Safety engineering  Seismology  Snow  Stochastic systems  Structural dynamics  Structural frames  Structures (built objects)  Wood  Wooden buildings  Coincidence factors  Displacement-based designs  Fragility  Performance based design  Seismic fragility curves  Structural safety  Wood structure  Wood-frame structures  Earthquake engineering  Earth Movement  Hazards  Reliability  Risk Assessment  Structural Design,0,1
13121,"Severe hurricanes in coastal areas have caused enormous human and economic losses. Furthermore, the intensity and frequency of future hurricanes may increase due to the potential impact of climate change. Due to common underlying climatological causes, interrelations may exist between successive hurricane events. This paper proposes a novel approach for modeling the temporal correlation in hurricane frequency and develops an analytical method that reflects this correlation to estimate the statistical properties of cumulative hurricane damage. The method provides a closed-form solution to the mean and variance of hurricane damage, and can be used to assess the impacts of temporal correlation and nonstationarity in hurricane events quantitatively. The applicability of the method is demonstrated through a case study of Miami-Dade County, Florida, in which it is found that the nonstationarity in hurricane events increases the mean value of hurricane damage over a future period of 100 years, while the temporal correlation increases its variance. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Modeling the Temporal Correlation in Hurricane Frequency for Damage Assessment of Residential Structures Subjected to Climate Change,2017,Climate change  Damage assessment  Hurricane  Nonstationarity  Residential buildings  Structural reliability  Structural safety and reliability  Temporal correlation,Climate change  Damage detection  Housing  Losses  Damage assessments  Non-stationarities  Residential building  Structural reliability  Structural safety  Temporal correlations  Hurricanes,0,1
13130,"Seismic damage of the structures normally begins at material level, develops at section, member, storey and structure levels, and finally ends at the global structural failure state. In order to study the damage evolution law of the structure, the deformation equivalent principle and generalized force-deformation relation are proposed. Thus, the multi-level seismic damage model is developed and shows consistent mechanical characteristic for every structural level. The multi-level seismic damage performance standard is proposed based on the general damage behavior of each structural level and generalized force-deformation relation. Furthermore, the limit damage value and critical performance indicators are defined. A normalized parameter is introduced to adjust the corresponding relation between the multi-level seismic damage model and performance. On the basis of extensive experimental data and numerical simulation results, the above relationships of each limit state are analyzed and the normalized parameters are obtained by numerical regression method. By the proposed multi-level damage model combined with performance standard, the calculated damage evolutions can correctly show the entire damage process and damage state for each structural level, which is a theoretical basis to reveal the inherent law of structural seismic damage performance. ©, 2015, Editorial Office of China Civil Engineering Journal.

In this procedure, Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) method has been employed to generate 30 random SATMD-structure systems and nonlinear incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) has been conducted under 20 earthquakes to determine the structural responses, where failure probabilities in each intensity level have been evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method.

The failure criteria considered are maximum inter-story drift ratio as a safety criterion, maximum absolute acceleration as a convenience criterion and TMD stroke length. The relationship between intensity measure and responses of the structure was assumed to follow the power-law model, and a regression analysis was used to estimate its properties. A nonlinear eight-story shear building subjected to near-fault earthquakes was used for the numerical studies. Fragility curves using multiple and single failure functions for an uncontrolled structure and a structure equipped with optimal TMDs were developed. Numerical analysis showed that using multiple failure functions led to increasing the fragility when compared with using the single failure function for both the uncontrolled and controlled structures. However, TMDs slightly reduced the seismic fragility and have the capability to improve the reliability of the structure. Also, it was found that the fragility was significantly influenced by the values of the capacity thresholds of both the acceleration of the structure and TMD stroke length, which should be selected by considering the target performance and application of the structure and control device. © 2021, Institute of Engineering Mechanics, China Earthquake Administration.",Multiple failure function based fragility curves for structures equipped with TMD,2021,fragility curves  multiple failure function  passive control  tuned mass dampers,Outages  Structural optimization  Controlled structures  Fragility curves  Intensity measure  Inter-story drift ratios  Multiple failures  Near-fault earthquake  Performance and applications  Seismic fragility  Failure (mechanical),0,1

The implemented retrofitting techniques were adding RC shear walls (SW) and steel bracing systems. Simulation and analysis procedures were performed in a nonlinear platform. Models are designed based on ACI 318-14 and ANSI/AISC 360-10 for concrete and steel, respectively. Non-linear time history analysis (NL-THA), non-linear static analysis (NL-SA) and collapse margin ratio are carried out to evaluate the performance of existing and retrofitted structures. Incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) curves are then generated and used to develop the seismic fragility curves. Three different strong ground motions are used in the analyses by referring to the UBC 1997 requirement. The IDA curves are compared based on five performance levels; operational phase (OP), immediate occupancy (IO), damage control (DC), life safety (LS), and collapse prevention (CP). The fragility curves and the calculated CMRs indicated that the shear wall and steel bracing systems both provide good seismic improvement and are able to achieve strengthening solution targets for an existing building system; however, the performance of RC-SW system under seismic excitation was much better.

13202,"Reinforced concrete (RC) structures often remain stable under fire, but exhibit damage and residual deformations which require repairs. While repair operations and building downtime are expensive, current fire design approaches do not consider post-event resilience. The first step to enable predicting the resilience of RC structures under fire is to develop capabilities to model the damage of these structures after various fire exposures. This paper focuses on the prediction of the residual (post-fire) deformations of RC columns within a code-designed five-story RC frame building. Computational modeling approaches to capture the fire behavior of the columns are investigated. The models range from isolated columns with linear springs at the boundaries to full building model coupling beam and shell elements, with intermediate approaches. The analyses highlight the critical nonlinear role of the thermal expansion-contraction of the surrounding beams and slabs on the column deformations. Large transversal residual deformations develop particularly in perimeter columns, combined with residual shortening. This invalidates models based on isolated column or 2D frame. A parametric study of the residual deformations of RC columns is then conducted, with due consideration of the 3D restraints and interactions, to investigate the effects of different design parameters and fire scenarios on the residual deformations after a fire event. The results of the parametric study indicate that fire load density and opening factor significantly influence the residual deformations of RC columns, compared to the thermal conductivity of concrete and live loads.

The uncertain tsunami source characteristics are represented by multiple source inversion models and their stochastic variations that are generated using the spectral analysis and synthesis method. By conducting Monte Carlo tsunami simulation, stochastic inundation depth maps can be developed, which are subsequently integrated with tsunami fragility curves to develop stochastic tsunami risk maps. The stochastic tsunami risk maps display spatial variability of tsunami damage probabilities for a building portfolio, reflecting not only possible tsunami scenarios but also uncertain tsunami resistance of buildings. The numerical results indicate that both stochastic tsunami risk maps and risk curves are affected by the local terrain features, proximity to major tsunami sources, and building characteristics (material type and story number). Consideration of different reference tsunami source models in probabilistic tsunami risk assessment are identified as one of the critical contributors to the overall uncertainty of the tsunami risk predictions.

13248,"Because property damage and loss of life owing to floods have increased in many countries in recent years, accurate assessment of flood risk is urgently needed for effective flood management. Improving the assessment of flood risk requires considering the impact of dam operation for flood control because dams and reservoirs play important roles in the assessment of flood hazards and associated damage. However, the impact of dam operation on flood hazards and associated damage was not considered well in previous assessments of flood risk. This paper focused on the quantitative assessment of flood hazard and risk, including the effectiveness of dam operation for flood prevention. The grid-based approach integrating the following was applied for analysis: (i) a hydrological-hydraulic model, (ii) a method considering the dam operation for flood control, and (iii) an assessment of flood damage. To assess the risk, flood characteristics were computed using the rainfall-runoff-inundation hydrological-hydraulic model, and flood damage was estimated by integrating the flood characteristics, flood damage curves, exposure characteristics, and property values. The risk was assessed by focusing on flood damage to residential buildings and assets and agricultural sectors for the largest recent floods and flood events with different return periods. This study considered the Bago River Basin of Myanmar. Results show that the dam operation for flood control in the study area reduces the flood inundation area by approximately 10% and flood damage to buildings, assets, and agriculture by approximately 40%, 60%, and 10%, respectively.",Quantitative assessment of flood risk with evaluation of the effectiveness of dam operation for flood control: A case of the Bago River Basin of Myanmar,2020,Quantitative risk assessment  Household damage  Rice-crop damage  Flood control measures  Myanmar,INUNDATION RRI MODEL  HAZARD ASSESSMENT  CLIMATE-CHANGE  ESTABLISHMENT  AGRICULTURE  IMPACTS,0,1
13263,"In the case of huge tsunamis, such as the 2004 Great Indian Ocean Tsunami and 2011 Great East Japan Tsunami, the damage caused by ground scour is serious. Therefore, it is important to improve prediction models for the topographical change of huge tsunamis. For general models that predict topographical change, the flow velocity distribution of a flood region is calculated by a numerical model based on a nonlinear long wave theory, and the distribution of bed-load rates is calculated using this velocity distribution and an equation for evaluating bed-load rates. This bed-load rate equation usually has a coefficient that can be decided using verification simulations. For the purpose, Ribberink's formula has high reproducibility within an oscillating flow and was chosen by the authors. Ribberink's formula needs a bed-load transport coefficient that requires sufficient verification simulations, as it consumes plenty of time and money to decide its value. Therefore, the authors generated diagrams that can define the suitable bed-load coefficient simply using the data acquired from hydraulic experiments on a movable bed. Subsequently, for the verification purpose of the model, the authors performed reproduced simulations of topography changes caused by the 2011 Great East Japan Tsunami at some coasts in Northern Japan using suitable coefficients acquired from the generated diagrams. The results of the simulations were in an acceptable range. The authors presented the preliminary generated diagrams of the same methodology but with insubstantial experimental data at the time at the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE), (2018 and 2019). However, in this paper, an adequate amount of data was added to the developed diagrams based on many hydraulic experiments to further raise their reliability and their application extent. Furthermore, by reproducing the tsunami simulation on the Sendai Natori coast of Japan, the authors determined that the impact of total bed-load transport was much bigger than that of suspension loads. Besides, the simulation outputs revealed that the mitigation effect of the cemented sand and gravel (CSG) banks and artificial refuge hills reduced tsunami damage on Japan's Hamamatsu coast. Since a lot of buildings and structures in the inundation area can be destroyed by tsunamis, building destruction design was presented in this paper through an economy and simplified state. Using the proposed tsunami simulation model, we acquired the inundation depth at any specific time and location within the inundated area. Because the inundation breadth due to a huge tsunami can extend kilometers toward the inland area, the evaluation of building destruction is an important measure to consider. Therefore, the authors in this paper presented useful threshold diagrams to evaluate building destruction with an easy and cost-efficient state. The threshold diagrams of width of a pillar for buildings or width of concrete block walls not breaking to each inundation height were developed using the data of damages due to the 2011 Great East Japan Tsunami.",Rational Evaluation Methods of Topographical Change and Building Destruction in the Inundation Area by a Huge Tsunami,2020,tsunami inundation simulation  topography change due to a huge tsunami  wall  pillar resistance against tsunami  CSG dike,FRAGILITY CURVES,0,1
13270,"The definition of relationships between damage and losses is a crucial aspect for the prediction of seismic effects and the development of reliable models to define risk maps, loss scenarios and mitigation strategies. The paper focuses on the analysis of post-earthquake empirical data to define relationships between buildings' damage expressed as usability rating or as global damage state and the associated costs for repair (i.e. direct costs) or for population assistance (i.e. a part of total indirect costs). The analysis refers to the data collected on residential buildings damaged by 2009 L'Aquila earthquake. For different usability rating or damage states, the paper presents the costs expressed in terms of percentage with respect to the reference unit cost of a new building (%C-r and %C-a for repair and population assistance costs, respectively). In particular, the costs analysis refers to undamaged, lightly or severely damaged buildings classified according to usability rating (i.e. A, B-C or E according to Italian classification) or to five different global Damage States (DSs). DSs comply with European Macroseismic Scale (EMS-98) and derive from literature available matrices properly defined to convert empirical damage to structural and non-structural components into building global damage. The %C-r probability density functions and relevant statistics derive from the analysis of actual data of post-earthquake reconstruction process, while, to determine those related to %C-a, a deep analysis of population assistance types, person/month assistance cost for each assistance form, and a methodology to associate such costs to each building are herein presented and discussed. Finally, the paper presents a relationship calibrated on empirical data to directly correlate repair costs on a building with assistance costs to their occupants. The relationships between empirical damage and direct and indirect costs herein presented are of paramount importance because they allow reliable loss scenarios to be defined by simply using literature fragility curves (defined according to empirical or mechanical approaches) aimed at evaluating the probability of exceeding different usability rating or damage states of existing buildings.",Relationships between empirical damage and direct/indirect costs for the assessment of seismic loss scenarios,,Repair costs  Population assistance costs  Direct and indirect costs  Empirical damage  Usability rating  Damage states  Post-earthquake reconstruction process  Loss scenarios,REPAIR COSTS  RC BUILDINGS  RISK-ASSESSMENT  VULNERABILITY  FRAGILITY  DERIVATION  CURVES,0,1
13271,In the present study two popular approaches for the seismic fragility evaluation of RC buildings are considered. First approach is based on series of time history analysis and a power law representing probabilistic seismic demand model. Second approach is based on Incremental Dynamics Analysis to determine the median collapse intensity measure. The two methods are formulated with different assumptions and methodologies for evaluations. The fragility curves and reliability indices are developed for a typical four storeyed frame by both the approaches and a comparison study is performed.

13282,"Since 1990, natural hazards have led to over 1.6 million fatalities globally, and economic losses are estimated at an average of around USD260-310 billion per year. The scientific and policy communities recognise the need to reduce these risks. As a result, the last decade has seen a rapid development of global models for assessing risk from natural hazards at the global scale. In this paper, we review the scientific literature on natural hazard risk assessments at the global scale, and we specifically examine whether and how they have examined future projections of hazard, exposure, and/or vulnerability. In doing so, we examine similarities and differences between the approaches taken across the different hazards, and we identify potential ways in which different hazard communities can learn from each other. For example, there are a number of global risk studies focusing on hydrological, climatological, and meteorological hazards that have included future projections and disaster risk reduction measures (in the case of floods), whereas fewer exist in the peer-reviewed literature for global studies related to geological hazards. On the other hand, studies of earthquake and tsunami risk are now using stochastic modelling approaches to allow for a fully probabilistic assessment of risk, which could benefit the modelling of risk from other hazards. Finally, we discuss opportunities for learning from methods and approaches being developed and applied to assess natural hazard risks at more continental or regional scales. Through this paper, we hope to encourage further dialogue on knowledge sharing between disciplines and communities working on different hazards and risk and at different spatial scales.",Review article: Natural hazard risk assessments at the global scale,2020,None,EXTREME SEA LEVELS  CLIMATE-CHANGE  DISASTER RISK  FLOOD RISK  PROBABILISTIC ASSESSMENT  INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT  FRAGILITY CURVES  BUILDING DAMAGE  DROUGHT RISK  EXPOSURE,0,1
13287,"This paper provides a risk-based assessment of the sustainability of structural design alternatives in hazard-prone regions. Little systematic research has been done to assess the economic, social, and environmental cost of sustainable construction in relation to hazard resilience or the impacts of hazard-resilient design on system sustainability. However, some studies have suggested that green construction practices might compromise the objective of the design of hazard resistance of a building, whereas others have highlighted that the impacts of natural hazard damage are unsustainable, given the costs of reconstruction and threats to public safety, among other consequences. This paper extends the performance-based engineering paradigm beyond traditional metrics of structural performance to quantify such sustainability metrics as monetary cost, embodied energy, emissions, casualties, and downtime. The upfront environmental and economic costs of sustainable design alternatives are then compared with hazard-induced risks, considering uncertainties stemming from the hazard, damage assessment, or sustainability analysis. The sustainability analysis is illustrated for both bridges and buildings sited in seismically prone regions, revealing the potential trade-off in upfront costs and lifetime sustainability attributable to hazard exposure. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Risk-Based Assessment of Sustainability and Hazard Resistance of Structural Design,2016,Bridges  Buildings  Environmental impacts  Fragility  Lifecycle analysis  Risk assessment  Seismic  Sustainable structures,Bridges  Buildings  Cost benefit analysis  Cost engineering  Costs  Damage detection  Design  Ecodesign  Economic and social effects  Environmental impact  Hazards  Life cycle  Risk analysis  Risk assessment  Structural analysis  Structural design  Uncertainty analysis  Fragility  Life cycle analysis  Performance-based engineering  Risk-based assessments  Seismic  Sustainability analysis  Sustainable construction  Sustainable structure  Sustainable development,0,1
13297,"The article addresses the seismic vulnerability assessment of a typology of unreinforced masonry buildings constructed in Lisbon between the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries. The main architectural and structural features of these buildings are presented. This supported the identification of the main uncertainties affecting their seismic performance and the definition of classes of buildings representative of the typology. The seismic assessment includes the generation of fragility curves that combine the in-plane and out-of-plane response following different criteria and methods of analyses. The results put in evidence the seismic vulnerability of this class of buildings. Considering the earthquake-resistant code for Lisbon with a return period of 475 years, about 50% probability of having heavy damage and about 30% probability of collapse were estimated. The structural intervention on these buildings is urgent in order to reduce losses due to future earthquakes.

Incremental dynamic analysis-based fragility curves are developed to cover various uncertainties involved in performance evaluation. Among different methods, regression analysis has been used to estimate fragility curve parameters. Torsion imbalanced building model from SMART 2008 project has been studied. Seismic performance is investigated by developing fragility curves for various damage states along global orthogonal directions. To see the damages at local level, fragility curves are also been developed for specified control points. From the study it has been observed that, for torsion imbalance buildings, shear wall is very effective in reducing the probability of damage, in distributing similar effect along orthogonal directions.

13348,"Fragility analysis was conducted for reinforced concrete frame buildings in Canada designed based on the 1965 National Building Code of Canada as representative of pre-1975 era of seismic design practice. Two-, five-, and ten-storey buildings were designed for Vancouver and Ottawa, representing buildings in high and medium seismic regions. They were modelled for inelastic response time history analysis, with respective inelastic hysteretic models for flexure and shear. Software PERFORM-3D was used to conduct incremental dynamic analysis under incrementally increasing earthquake intensity. Probabilistic analysis of the results of incremental dynamic analysis led to the development of fragility functions, which can be used as seismic vulnerability assessment tools. The results are compared with those generated for frame buildings designed on the basis of the 2010 NBCC. The comparison indicates that the probabilities of exceeding performance levels are significantly higher for older buildings relative to recently built fully ductile and moderately ductile buildings, respectively. © 2018, Canadian Science Publishing.

13352,"Nowadays, performance-based seismic design is the focus of earthquake engineering research, in which the seismic performance of a structure is mainly evaluated based on seismic fragility. However, the role of Engineering Demand Parameters (EDPs) on the seismic fragility analysis of Steel Reinforced Concrete (SRC) frame structures remains unclear. This paper presents results on the effects of EDPs on the seismic behavior of a plan-asymmetric SRC building. For this purpose, a nonlinear finite element model of the SRC frame structure was numerically developed using the OpenSees software. This finite element model was then validated using experimental results. The peak interstory drift ratios, as well as the component-based and material-based damage indices, were accordingly employed as EDPs. This study additionally shows seismic fragility curves for an SRC frame structure. The achieved results for the mentioned EDPs were both compared and analyzed. The findings indicated that the EDPs play a role in the seismic fragility analysis for the SRC frame structures. The fragility curves based on a damage index could display the probability of exceeding the ultimate limit states subjected to different seismic intensities, and also showed a similar manner with those based on peak interstory drift ratios. It can be concluded that for an SRC frame structure, the results of seismic fragility analysis using the component-based damage index proved to be more cost-effective and reliable. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Seismic fragility analysis of steel reinforced concrete frame structures based on different engineering demand parameters,2018,OpenSees  Seismic damage index  Seismic fragility analysis  Steel Reinforced Concrete (SRC) frame structures,Composite structures  Cost effectiveness  Damage detection  Finite element method  Reinforced concrete  Seismology  Structural analysis  Structural frames  Engineering demand parameters  Non-linear finite element model  Opensees  Performance based seismic design  Seismic damage indices  Seismic fragility analysis  Steel reinforced concrete  Steel reinforced concrete frame (SRC)  Seismic design,0,1
13356,"In Italy, the recent regulatory and legislative developments relevant to the seismic risk mitigation of the existing building stock aim to propose tax deductions and simple but reliable approaches for the quantitative evaluation of the beneficial impacts of seismic retrofitting. Nevertheless, currently policy makers need tools and models able to assess the seismic risk and the cost/benefit of the strengthening interventions at regional/national level in order to plan future mitigation policies and be aware of the effectiveness of measures taken. To this aim, this article proposes a heuristic vulnerability model for large-scale applications. Starting from macroseismic approaches widely used in Europe, fragility and vulnerability curves for masonry and RC buildings are calibrated using a specific procedure based on the new Italian ‘guidelines for the seismic risk classification of constructions’ approved in January 2020, namely the so-called ‘Sisma Bonus.’ According to the construction material, building type and number of floors, the developed curves are defined in terms of vulnerability and height classes. The derived vulnerability model can be used in exposure models which rely on poor census data. Finally, it is compared with existing vulnerability models and the comparisons are analysed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Seismic fragility and vulnerability curves for the Italian residential building stock,2021,Buildings  concrete structures  damage assessment  decision support systems  masonry  reliability & risk analysis  residential  risk management  seismic engineering,Building materials  Depreciation  Population statistics  Risk assessment  Taxation  Large-scale applications  Mitigation policies  Quantitative evaluation  Residential building stocks  Seismic fragility  Seismic retrofitting  Seismic risk mitigation  Vulnerability models  Seismology,0,1
13370,"Fragility curve evaluation using ground motions compatible with conditional spectra allows for ground motion selection with good consistency with the hazard. However, this evaluation requires selecting ground motions from a database, which is not straightforward. Moreover, it relies on a fragility curve fitting procedure, which may fail to give a solution. Lastly, it estimates the statistical uncertainty of the curve based on simple bootstrap resampling. This paper proposes a novel framework for estimating fragility curves with two major improvements. First, the proposed fragility curve fitting procedure is not iterative and does not require an initial estimation of the curve parameters, unlike the existing curve fitting procedure. Second, the statistical uncertainty of fragility curves is estimated based on the Fisher’s information matrix, which is a rigorous alternative to bootstrap resampling. Moreover, stochastic ground motions compatible with the conditional spectra are generated and used as excitations. This is a practical alternative, as it does not require a ground motion database for scenario-specific selection. Results obtained with the developed framework are compared to results based on existing procedures in a case study of in-structure components in an industrial building. We analyze cases in which our curve fitting procedure gives a solution more reliably than the existing. Moreover, the developed procedure for estimating the uncertainty of fragility curves leads, in this case study, to better estimations for the statistical uncertainty of the fragility curves. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Seismic Fragility Curve Assessment Based on Synthetic Ground Motions with Conditional Spectra,2020,conditional spectra  curve fitting  Seismic fragility curve  statistical uncertainty  synthetic ground motions,Fisher information matrix  Office buildings  Sampling  Seismology  Stochastic systems  Uncertainty analysis  Bootstrap resampling  Industrial buildings  Information matrix  Initial estimation  Seismic fragility curves  Statistical uncertainty  Structure component  Synthetic ground motions  Curve fitting  ground motion  hazard assessment  interpolation  probability  reliability analysis  seismic hazard  uncertainty analysis,0,1
13372,"Performance of reinforced concrete frame buildings depends on seismic hazard of the region and vulnerability of the structure. Performance-based evaluation of buildings may be conducted through fragility curves developed for different levels of performance. Reinforced concrete frame buildings with 2, 5, and 10-stories, designed as moderately ductile buildings for Ottawa in Eastern Canada and fully ductile buildings for Vancouver in Western Canada were used to generate seismic fragility curves. The buildings were analyzed using PERFORM-3D software to assess seismic vulnerabilities. Incremental dynamic analysis was employed to generate fragility curves. Two sets of earthquake records compatible with uniform hazard spectra of 2010 NBCC were selected, where each set contained 20 records for each city.

13377,"4- and 8-storey reinforced-concrete frame buildings are analyzed under the suites of the near-fault pulse-like, and the corresponding spectrally equivalent far-fault ground-motion records. Seismic fragility curves for the slight, moderate, extensive, and complete damage states are developed, and the damage probability matrices, and the mean loss ratios corresponding to the Design Basis Earthquake and the Maximum Considered Earthquake hazard levels are compared, for the investigated buildings and sets of ground-motion records. It is observed that the spectrally equivalent far-fault ground-motion records result in comparable estimates of the fragility curve parameters, as that of the near-fault pulse-like ground-motion records. As a result, the derived damage probability matrices and mean loss ratios using two suites of ground-motion records differ only marginally (of the order of ~10%) for the investigated levels of seismic hazard, thus, implying the potential for application of the spectrally equivalent ground-motion records, for seismic fragility and risk assessment at the near-fault sites. © 2020 Techno-Press, Ltd.",Seismic fragility curves using pulse-like and spectrally equivalent ground-motion records,2020,Damage probability matrix  Ground-motion  Nonlinear response  Reinforced-concrete frame buildings  Seismic fragility  Seismic risk,Damage detection  Faulting  Hazards  Reinforced concrete  Risk assessment  Seismic design  Damage probability matrices  Fragility curves  Maximum considered earthquakes  Pulse-like ground motions  Reinforced concrete frame buildings  Seismic fragility  Seismic fragility curves  Seismic hazards  Earthquake effects,0,1
13384,"Existing research to predict seismic fragility of Reinforced Concrete Containment (RCC) buildings does not take into account the impact of its inelastic bidirectional interaction arising from bidirectional horizontal ground motions. Hence, this study attempts to present a reliable and feasible method for fragility of the RCC subject to bidirectional ground motions. Three bidirectional load histories due to inelastic bidirectional interaction are firstly introduced to determine displacement-based failure limits for this structure. Nine bidirectional earthquake Intensity Measures (IMs) are developed to perform the bidirectional Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA). For the selection of an optimum method for fragility under bidirectional earthquake excitations, three fragility analysis methods are conducted and their results are compared. Results show that the maximum likelihood method yields better fragility results than the other two methods. The safety factor method for fragility cannot get the aleatory randomness properly.

13397,"The construction of underground structures in Lisbon’s downtown, alongside with the fluctuation of the ground water level, generates settlement-induced damages to old heritage Pombalino masonry buildings. Assessing the potential damage caused by soil settlements to masonry structures is essential for adequate evaluation of their seismic performance and the definition of retrofit solutions. The seismic assessment procedures need to take into account the settlement induced damage and the non-linear behaviour of the masonry materials. This paper seizes a rare opportunity to join, in the same analysis, real settlement profiles imposed to well-characterized historical building typology, known as Pombalino, with the evaluation of their seismic performance simulated with advanced numerical models. Lisbon’s downtown settlements were measured for seven years. From these settlement measures, two settlements’ profiles and two settlements’ rate were identified. This paper presents the results of a study developed on a representative Pombalino building where these settlement profiles were applied to assess their impact on the initial damage and on the seismic performance of the building. The expected level of damage for a given ground motion intensity was estimated through the employment of numerical modelling and nonlinear static analysis, which has shown that damages induced by settlements can reduce significantly the global seismic performance of the building. The level of damage of the building at a global level and local level was studied. For the latter, the damage on structural elements is defined by the mean of the drift parameter, while for the former, the damages levels are defined directly in the pushover curve. This study assessed quantitatively the effect of the differential settlement on the seismic performance of Pombalino buildings and their fragility curves. The results showed the seismic action intensity needed to reach the collapse of the structure is roughly half for longitudinal configuration with the curved profile and nearly 1/5 for transversal shape with the linear profile, when compared to the building without differential settlements. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Seismic performance and fragility curves of historical residential buildings in Lisbon downtown affected by settlements,2020,Damage analyses  Drift  Fragility curves  Nonlinear static analyses  Pombalino buildings  Seismic performance  Settlements,Buildings  Groundwater  Masonry materials  Numerical models  Petroleum reservoir evaluation  Seismic waves  Seismology  Underground structures  Water levels  Ground motion intensities  Historical buildings  Non-linear static analysis  Nonlinear behaviours  Pombalino buildings  Residential building  Seismic Performance  Structural elements  Damage detection  collapse  construction  ground motion  masonry  seismic retrofit  underground construction  Lisboa [Portugal]  Lisbon  Portugal,0,1

13489,"This paper presents a comprehensive review of methods to assess building vulnerability for hurricane catastrophe models. The review identified five main types of assessment approaches judging by the underlying methodology: past-loss data, enhanced damage data, heuristic, physics, and simulation. The applicability of past-loss data-only vulnerability methods proved insufficient for the diversity of situations insurance companies faced. Therefore, modelers complemented this method with engineering and meteorology expert knowledge; these are the enhanced-data models. Expert opinion and subjective probabilities drive the heuristic models; these were short lived in the United States, but are still used when data are scarce. Component-based methods were developed as a more realistic alternative to enhanced-data models by assessing vulnerability within an engineering framework complemented with expert opinion. Simulation models enhanced the physical models with a probabilistic simulation of the wind-structure interaction and more realistic assessment of the hazard. This paper also reviews some influential postdisaster studies utilized for validation. In addition, this paper presents a temporal and spatial map showing linkages between models.

13535,"In the framework of seismic risk analyses at large scale, among the available methods for the vulnerability assessment the empirical and expert elicitation based ones still represent one of most widely used options. In fact, despite some drawbacks, they benefit of a direct correlation to the actual seismic behaviour of buildings and they are easy to handle also on huge stocks of buildings. Within this context, the paper illustrates a macroseismic vulnerability model for unreinforced masonry existing buildings that starts from the original proposal of Lagomarsino and Giovinazzi (Bull Earthquake Eng 4(4):445–463, 2006) and has further developed in recent years. The method may be classified as heuristic, in the sense that: (a) it is based on the expertise that is implicit in the European Macroseismic Scale (EMS98), with fuzzy assumptions on the binomial damage distribution; (b) it is calibrated on the observed damage in Italy, available in the database Da.D.O. developed by the Italian Department of Civil Protection (DPC). This approach guarantees a fairly well fitting with actual damage but, at the same time, ensures physically consistent results for both low and high values of the seismic intensity (for which observed data are incomplete or lacking). Moreover, the method provides a coherent distribution between the different damage levels. The valuable data in Da.D.O. allowed significant improvements of the method than its original version. The model has been recently applied in the context of ReLUIS project, funded by the DPC to support the development of Italian Risk Maps. To this aim, the vulnerability model has been applied for deriving fragility curves. This step requires to introduce a correlation law between the Macroseismic Intensity (adopted for the calibration of the model from a wide set of real damage data) and the Peak Ground Acceleration (at present, one of most used instrumental intensity measures); this conversion further increases the potential of the macroseismic method. As presented in the paper, the first applications of the model have produced plausible and consistent results at national scale, both in terms of damage scenarios and total risk (economic loss, consequences to people). © 2021, The Author(s).",The heuristic vulnerability model: fragility curves for masonry buildings,2021,Calibration by observed damage  Fragility curves  Macroseismic vulnerability model  Mean damage grade  Vulnerability index,Distributed database systems  Losses  Maps  Masonry materials  Risk analysis  Risk assessment  Risk perception  Seismology  Damage distribution  Expert elicitation  Intensity measure  Macroseismic intensity  Peak ground acceleration  Unreinforced masonry  Vulnerability assessments  Vulnerability models  Heuristic methods  detection method  masonry  peak acceleration  vulnerability  Italy  Matthiola,0,1
13536,"The March 2015 extraordinary hydrometeomlogical event in the Andes cordillera caused severe floods in the southern Atacama Desert. One of the most affected cities was CopiapO (northern Chile) located downstream of the junction between the CopiapO river and its ephemeral tributary Quebrada Paipote. This work analyses the features of this catastrophic flood and relates them with the identified impacts. A large volume of water mixed with fine sediments overflowed the tributary channel generating a flood that affected 72% of the urban area. The rheological (velocity, density and flow regime) and sedimentary features of the flow reveal the occurrence of massive mudflows that infilled the space available inside the buildings, buried the streets with a sandy mud deposit of more than 30 cm medium thickness and collapsed the sewer network. The post-event survey carried out by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning (MINVU) was used for the development of fragility curves that allows modelling the probability of damage. Results indicate that the greatest probability of building damage is generated by the accumulation of sediments instead of by the flow depth. On the other hand, once the very fine grain sediments of the top of the deposit dried up, it increased the concentration of post-event suspension particulate matter, causing a health issue. This work highlights the need to understand mudflow processes and their consequences in arid environments to improve urban planning and mitigate future damages since their impacts strongly affect infrastructures and communities.",The March 2015 catastrophic flood event and its impacts in the city of Copiapo (southern Atacama Desert).

Initially, a probabilistic tornado hazard analysis was performed in order to develop tornado hazard curves at select locations across the United States. This analysis resulted in the annual probability of experiencing a tornado of any strength at the specific locations, which varied as a function of location-specific occurrence rates. Five different residential wood-frame building archetypes were designed at each of the locations based on current residential building code and/or practice. Fragilities for the roof sheathing and truss to wall top-plate connections were developed for each archetype. Because fragilities are independent of location, they were then convolved with the tornado hazard curves to compute annual failure probabilities for select roof components. This represents the first time absolute risk of roof failure due to tornadoes has been computed since the tornado hazard curve is convolved with the fragility curves. These probabilities quantify failure probabilities of residential wood-frame roofs to tornado winds. While this value is quite small for an individual home, applying this method to an individual city block or neighborhood can quantify a location's vulnerability to tornado wind damage. The Florida state building code is applied to other locations in the United States, fragilities are developed and convolved, and failure probabilities for these modified buildings are computed. The comparison of failure probabilities between local building code and the stricter Florida residential building code allowed for a quantitative assessment of strengthened construction practices for structures subjected to tornadic wind loads. Results indicate that stricter building codes may be beneficial in areas with a high annual tornado risk, such as Tornado Alley. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Tornado Risk Analysis for Residential Wood-Frame Roof Damage across the United States,2016,Convolution  Fragility  Hazard analysis  Residential structures  Tornado  Wood structures,Buildings  Codes (symbols)  Convolution  Hazards  Housing  Location  Probability  Risk analysis  Risk assessment  Roofs  Tornadoes  Wood  Wooden buildings  Annual failure probability  Annual probabilities  Construction practice  Fragility  Hazard analysis  Quantitative assessments  Residential structures  Wood structure  Building codes  Damage  Probability  Risk Assessment  Roofing  USA,0,1
13565,"This work describes the seismic vulnerability assessment of a railway masonry arch bridge. Its conservation state is initially investigated by means of a thorough field and laboratory test campaign, comprising destructive and non-destructive tests. Two different methods are used to evaluate the bridge seismic vulnerability. The first method adopts a deterministic approach and corresponds to a single non-linear static analysis, performed as described in the Eurocodes. The second method employs a probabilistic approach and considers the variability of the involved mechanical parameters (structure geometry and properties of the building materials) and seismic parameters (intensity of the action and site conditions). This method associates the probabilistic values of ground acceleration exceedance to the estimated seismic vulnerability. This is shown by means of fragility curves, which allow to take into consideration the uncertainty of the various components involved in the definition of the seismic vulnerability and display the seismic damage scenarios. Currently no code requires to perform this calculation procedure. In addition, this work compares the values of masonry mechanical properties specified in the Eurocodes with those obtained in an extensive investigation campaign involving more than one hundred masonry bridges. Compressive strength and longitudinal elasticity modulus are the relevant mechanical parameters investigated. The outcomes of this research can contribute to the development of a more efficient maintenance system of the masonry bridges belonging to the railway network. This has an important role when it comes to establishing the priority order of assets intervention. © 2018 The Author",Two methodological approaches to assess the seismic vulnerability of masonry bridges,2019,Bridge maintenance and conservation  Finite element analysis  Masonry mechanical parameters  Non-linear static analysis  Railway masonry arch bridge  Seismic fragility,Arches  Codes (standards)  Compressive strength  Finite element method  Masonry bridges  Masonry construction  Masonry materials  Nondestructive examination  Railroads  Seismology  Static analysis  Structural analysis  Bridge maintenance  Masonry arch bridges  Mechanical parameters  Non-linear static analysis  Seismic fragility  Arch bridges,0,1

12507,"The simplified mechanical method POST (PushOver on Shear Type models) for seismic vulnerability assessment of RC buildings is used in this study to derive damage scenarios for a database of 7597 RC buildings subjected to the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake. POST allows the evaluation of fragility curves through the determination of the non-linear static response of RC buildings in closed form, assuming the hypothesis of shear type behaviour, and considering the influence of infill panels both in the derivation of structural response and in assessment of building damage, which is defined according to the European Macroseismic Scale EMS-98. The aim of the present study is to provide a much more significant and reliable validation of the methodology, thanks to a much wider database compared to previous studies, and based on a different application of the methodology, i.e. at building class-level instead of single building-level. To this aim, the main geometrical-typological characteristics of the analysed buildings (number of storeys, age of construction, building area) have been statistically characterized based on data collected from post-earthquake AeDES survey forms, considering both the variability of each single parameter and the correlation that exists between one parameter and the other. This also allows to analyse the effectiveness of the adopted analytical procedure in predicting the general trends of observed damage with these parameters, showing a good agreement between observed and predicted trends. The overall predicted damage scenarios are compared with the corresponding observed ones, collected from AeDES survey forms, highlighting, again, a good agreement. Finally, the assumed mechanical interpretation of damage classification of EMS-98 is validated through the comparison between the distributions of damage to vertical structures and infill panels and the corresponding observed post-earthquake damage data.",A class-oriented mechanical approach for seismic damage assessment of RC buildings subjected to the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake,2018,2009 L'Aquila earthquake  RC buildings  Mechanical  Seismic fragility  Damage States  Post-earthquake,REINFORCED-CONCRETE FRAMES  VULNERABILITY  STRENGTH,0,1
12511,"In a cross-disciplinary study, we carried out an extensive literature review to increase understanding of vulnerability indicators used in the disciplines of earthquake and flood vulnerability assessments. We provide insights into potential improvements in both fields by identifying and comparing quantitative vulnerability indicators grouped into physical and social categories. Next, a selection of index and curve-based vulnerability models that use these indicators are described, comparing several characteristics such as temporal and spatial aspects. Earthquake vulnerability methods traditionally have a strong focus on object-based physical attributes used in vulnerability curve-based models, while flood vulnerability studies focus more on indicators applied to aggregated land-use classes in curve-based models. In assessing the differences and similarities between indicators used in earthquake and flood vulnerability models, we only include models that separately assess either of the two hazard types. Flood vulnerability studies could be improved using approaches from earthquake studies, such as developing object-based physical vulnerability curve assessments and incorporating time-of-the-day-based building occupation patterns. Likewise, earthquake assessments could learn from flood studies by refining their selection of social vulnerability indicators.

However, research efforts are often hampered by a lack of full-scale datasets. This is particularly the case for earthquake damage assessment research, where acquisition of scans is restricted by scarcity of access to post-earthquake sites. To solve this problem, we have developed a procedure for compiling digital specimens in both pre- and post-event states and for generating synthetic data equivalent to which would result from laser scanning in the field. The procedure is validated by comparing the physical and synthetic scans of a damaged beam. Interpretation of the beam damage from the synthetic data demonstrates the feasibility of using this procedure to replace physical specimens with digital models for experimentation and for other civil engineering applications. © 2015 ASCE.",A computational procedure for generating specimens of BIM and point cloud data for building change detection,2015,BIM  Change detection  Computational procedure  Damage assessment  Laser scanning,Architectural design  Digital storage  Earthquakes  Laser applications  Remote sensing  Semantics  Automated construction  Building change detection  Change detection  Civil engineering applications  Computational procedures  Construction progress tracking  Damage assessments  Laser scanning  Damage detection,0,1
12515,"Recent unprecedented events have highlighted that the existing approach to managing flood risk is inadequate for complex urban systems because of its overreliance on simplistic methods at coarse-resolution large scales, lack of model physicality using loose hydrologic-hydraulic coupling, and absence of urban water infrastructure at large scales. Distributed models are a potential alternative as they can capture the complex nature of these events through simultaneous tracking of hydrologic and hydrodynamic processes. However, their application to large-scale flood mapping and forecasting remains challenging without compromising on spatiotemporal resolution, spatial scale, model accuracy, and local-scale hydrodynamics. Therefore, it is essential to develop techniques that can address these issues in urban systems while maximizing computational efficiency and maintaining accuracy at large scales. This study presents a physically based but computationally efficient approach for large-scale (area &gt; 103 km2) flood modeling of extreme events using a distributed model called Interconnected Channel and Pond Routing. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with a hyperresolution-fixed-mesh model at 60-m resolution. Application of the proposed approach reduces the number of computational elements by 80% and the simulation time for Hurricane Harvey by approximately 4.5 times when compared to the fixed-resolution model. The results show that the proposed approach can simulate the flood stages and depths across multiple gages with a high accuracy (R2 &gt; 0.8). Comparison with Federal Emergency Management Agency building damage assessment data shows a correlation greater than 95% in predicting spatially distributed flooded locations. Finally, the proposed approach can estimate flood stages directly from rainfall for ungaged streams. ©2019. American Geophysical Union.

12516,"In recent years, many studies were been carried out in order to understanding and later mitigate the seismic risk. Several important projects have been funded, different methodologies have been developed; in particular, for emergencies management several application have been carried out with good results. On the contrary, mitigation and prevention of seismic risk could be more efficient by setting a careful assessment, maintenance and retrofitting of the built. In this sense, it to be noted that the seismic capacities of existing RC buildings have shown a key role in recent seismic events (e.g. Southern Italy 1980, Turkey 1999, L'Aquila 2009, Lorca, 2011, Emilia plan 2012). In particular, old RC buildings have often shown a poor and brittle behavior. Moreover, the low seismic performances of these buildings are the main reason of significant earthquake losses (in terms of economic, social and political activities) that can been considered generally as a direct consequence of physical damages on the buildings. About these important topics, it is the opinion of the authors, that quantitative models of fragility, referring to the most common types of buildings, have a key role in the evaluation process of risk and should been continuously improved. Therefore, in the seismic risk studies, a fundamental step is the development and use of fragility curves representative of the behavior of existing RC buildings. A significant number of proposals are currently available in the scientific literature. In this study, a critical review of existing different procedures for RC with Moment Resisting Frames (MRF) has carried out in order to highlight advantages and weakness of each proposal. A great variability in terms of geometrical, mechanical and structural characterization, structural modeling, method of analysis, scale of damage, parameters of seismic intensity and statistical procedure has been highlighted, and finally an optimal procedure of fragility analysis has been outlined.",A critical review of fragility curves for existing RC buildings,2016,Damage levels  Existing RC buildings  Fragility curves  Seismic risk mitigation  Structural performance,Buildings  Computational methods  Concrete buildings  Earthquakes  Risk assessment  Seismology  Structural frames  Damage level  Fragility curves  RC buildings  Seismic risk mitigation  Structural performance  Structural analysis,0,1

The damage prediction model was implemented in commercial finite element software ABAQUS by using the user material subroutine. Then, parameters used in the damage model of building structural steel base metal, heat affected zone and weld metal were calibrated respectively through monotonic loading tests and ultra low cyclic loading tests of notched coupon specimens, in addition, the damage evolution laws at the center of notched specimen under different loading conditions were compared. It can be observed from the comparison that crack always initiates in the center of specimens, which is consisted with the test results. Finally, the damage model were applied to investigate the damage evolution of beam to column welded joints under ultra low cyclic loading history.

12520,"The aim of this paper is that the precise description of damage behavior is crucial to well catch the mechanical behavior of structures in the dynamic numerical simulation, and address the issue on the coupled plastic-damage constitutive model for circular steel tubes of reticulated shells under severe earthquake. Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) constitutive model established by Lemaitre is reviewed at the beginning. Then, an improved damage model for circular steel tubes of reticulated shells is developed based on Lemaitre's model by replacing the original damage evolution law with a new one suitable for circular steel tubes. In addition, we introduce the stress update process. In this procedure, the well-known operator split strategy, which leads to the standard elastic predictor/return mapping algorithm, is adopted to solve the evolution problem of the improved model. Exploiting user-defined material subroutine, the implementation of the model is achieved within software ANSYS using BEAM189 element. Finally, the dynamic response of reticulated shells under severe earthquake are numerically simulated with the proposed model and with the conventional Prandtl-Reuss model, respectively. The comparison results show that the consideration of material damage accumulation, on the one hand, may change the failure mode of reticulated shells from dynamic instability to strength failure; on the other, may reduce the dynamic ultimate load obviously.

12521,"Flood risk analysis is more complex in urban areas than that in rural areas because of their closely packed buildings, different kinds of land uses, and large number of flood control works and drainage systems. The purpose of this paper is to propose a practical framework for flood risk analysis and benefit assessment of flood control measures in urban areas. Based on the concept of disaster risk triangle (hazard, vulnerability and exposure), a comprehensive analysis method and a general procedure were proposed for urban flood risk analysis. Urban Flood Simulation Model (UFSM) and Urban Flood Damage Assessment Model (UFDAM) were integrated to estimate the flood risk in the Pudong flood protection area (Shanghai, China). S-shaped functions were adopted to represent flood return period and damage (R-D) curves. The study results show that flood control works could significantly reduce the flood risk within the 66-year flood return period and the flood risk was reduced by 15.59%. However, the flood risk was only reduced by 7.06% when the flood return period exceeded 66-years. Hence, it is difficult to meet the increasing demands for flood control solely relying on structural measures. The R-D function is suitable to describe the changes of flood control capacity. This frame work can assess the flood risk reduction due to flood control measures, and provide crucial information for strategy development and planning adaptation. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",A framework for flood risk analysis and benefit assessment of flood control measures in Urban Areas,2016,EAD (expected annual damage)  Flood control measures  Flood risk analysis  R-D function  UFDAM  UFSM,adaptive management  computer simulation  cost-benefit analysis  disaster management  drainage network  flood control  flood damage  flood frequency  numerical model  planning method  risk assessment  urban area  China  disaster  exposure  model  risk assessment  risk reduction  urban area  city  flooding  prevention and control  procedures  risk assessment  China  Shanghai  China  Cities  Disasters  Floods  Risk Assessment,0,1
12522,"A simplified risk assessment framework specifically developed for built immovable cultural heritage assets is proposed. The framework addresses all the components in a risk analysis and can be used as a screening procedure for the preliminary assessment of a large number of assets with limited resources. Furthermore, the framework can also be used to identify cultural heritage assets that require a more refined and resource demanding risk evaluation. The proposed risk analysis framework falls into the category of qualitative methods and is based on an existing approach developed for the vulnerability assessment of critical infrastructures. The qualitative risk analysis of the proposed methodology is based on a set of structured assessment flowcharts that address the main components of a risk analysis: the likelihood of the hazard, the vulnerability of the asset to the hazard, the consequences of the hazard, the loss of value of the asset and the capacity to recover from the event. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed methodology, an application example is also presented for the case of seismic risk. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

12524,"Various duration definitions have been proposed to describe the effective strong motion duration based on a single component of ground motions. However, multi-component accelerograms are usually selected as the seismic excitations to evaluate the seismic performance of important infrastructures. Duration definitions able to consider the duration contributions from all components of ground motions are still lacking. In this paper, a general integrated duration definition for multi-component seismic excitations is proposed based on the existing concept of strong motion duration. According to the proposed definition, integrated bracketed duration, integrated uniform duration, and integrated significant duration are presented to measure durations for multi-component ground motions. Twenty as-recorded accelerograms with a broad range of durations are considered to investigate the correlation between integrated and single component durations. A series of nonlinear dynamic analyses are performed to quantify the influence of different integrated ground motion durations on several seismic demands (i.e. peak displacement, damage dissipation energy, and local damage index) of concrete gravity dam reservoir-foundation systems. In addition, the results also reveal the effects of vertical seismic excitations on the seismic response of concrete gravity dams and emphasize the necessity to consider vertical motions in seismic performance assessment of such infrastructures.

12527,"Seismic vulnerability assessment is a critical topic in disaster management. It is a complex uncertain spatial decision making problem due to lack of complete data, vagueness of experts' comments in addition to uncertainties in the numerical data/relations. This paper presents a new Geospatial Information System (GIS)-based multi-criterion decision-making (MCDM) method developed for predicting building damages prior to the occurrence of a potential earthquake scenario which considers different sources of uncertainty to make realistic assessments. The developed method suggests an approximate reasoning approach through using Fuzzy Sets theory (FST) and enhanced Dempster-Shafer theory (DST). FST handles the vagueness of the heuristic knowledge on 'importance weights of the selected criteria' and 'the relationship of the criteria with physical seismic vulnerability (PSV)'. The enhanced DST is used for fusion of the information by taking into account the reliability of the adopted criteria. The proposed method's applicability is tested on existing buildings of a municipality district of Tabriz, a historical and earthquake prone city in Iran.

12531,"Seismic hazard mitigation is becoming an important consideration in planning for disaster-resilient cities. Seismic hazard and urban vulnerability are the two major factors in the assessment of seismic risk. Peak ground acceleration (PGA) and peak ground displacement (PGD) are the two major measures of seismic hazards, and land-use and building patterns characterize urban vulnerability. A set of pseudodata is generated by an earthquake-engineering simulation model for the city of Taichung, Taiwan, using twenty-two significant historical seismic events. A seismic damage model is first statistically estimated, relating monetary building damages to seismic impacts (PGA and PGD) and building inventories (residential, commercial, industrial, government). This damage function is then incorporated into a seismic land-use optimization model to allocate future land uses to the available land while minimizing aggregate seismic damages. Solving the model under the twenty-two seismic events and under different regional growth scenarios generates robust site rankings, pointing to priority locations for future activities away from the most severe historical earthquakes. These rankings can help decision makers allocate future activities under the uncertainty of both regional development and seismic hazard. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",A land-use allocation optimization model to mitigate potential seismic damages,2015,earthquake simulation  land-use planning  optimization  seismic hazard  urban resilience,computer simulation  disaster management  earthquake damage  earthquake engineering  land use planning  optimization  seismic hazard  urban planning  vulnerability  Taichung  Taiwan,0,1
12533,"SP-BELA (Simplified Pushover Based Earthquake Loss Assessment) is a mechanic based fragility methodology adopted in large scale vulnerability assessment for the definition of seismic risk and damage scenario. The method has been developed for RC cast in place [1], RC pre cast [2] and low vulnerability masonry buildings [3]. SP-BELA identifies numerically the damage limit states by checking deformation and stress limit conditions on the structural elements of buildings. The capability of SP-BELA methodology to represent the seismic performance of Italian buildings has been improved through a calibration process recently completed. By using data collected from observed damage in the earthquakes occurred in Italy from 1976 (earthquake of Friuli) to 2009 (L'Aquila earthquake), calibration coefficients have been computed. They have been adopted in order to define fragility curves for five damage levels (those of EMS98 scale, [4]) and for five vulnerability classes. SP-BELA has been adopted to define seismic risk and damage scenario of Italian residential and school buildings. In order to provide a user friendly tool to support decision makers during emergency management, a platform with GIS functionality has been developed. When an earthquake occurs, the WebGIS platform can evaluate real time damage scenario and seismic risk maps. The platform allows to input data of an occurred earthquake. The tool allows to define ground shaking scenario in terms of magnitude, epicentre position, depth, fault mechanism and attenuation relationship. The fault can be defined by starting from an Italian database, the DISS database (Database of Individual Seismogenic Sources [5]) of INGV (National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology). Alternatively, a new user digitalized fault can be input. The platform allows also the evaluation of real-time damage scenarios with ShakeMap. Finally, it enables to visualize in tables and maps the seismic risk calculated for different return period and time windows.

12538,"This study examines the relation between maximum seismic displacements and residual displacements for reinforced concrete building structures. In order to achieve a reliable relationship between these critical structural parameters for the seismic performance of concrete buildings, an extensive parametric study is conducted by examining the nonlinear behavior of numerous planar framed structures. In this work, dynamic inelastic analyses are executed to investigate the seismic behavior of two sets of frames. The first group consists of four planar frames which have been designed for seismic and vertical loads according to modern structural codes while the second group also consists of four frames, which have been designed for vertical loads only, in order to examine older structures that have been designed using codes with inadequate seismic provisions. These two sets of buildings are subjected to various earthquakes with different amplitudes in order to develop a large structural response databank. On the basis of this wide-ranging parametric investigation, after an appropriate statistical analysis, simple empirical expressions are proposed for a straightforward and efficient evaluation of maximum seismic displacements of reinforced concrete buildings structures from their permanent deformation. Permanent displacements can be measured in-situ after strong ground motions as a post-earthquake assessment. It can be concluded that the measure of permanent deformation can be efficiently used to estimate the post-seismic performance level of reinforced concrete buildings.",A New Method to Evaluate the Post-Earthquake Performance and Safety of Reinforced Concrete Structural Frame Systems,2020,structural safety  post-seismic performance of reinforced concrete structures  residual deformation  maximum deformation,MAXIMUM SEISMIC DISPLACEMENTS  DUCTILITY DEMANDS  DAMAGE ASSESSMENT  DEFORMATION  BEHAVIOR,0,1

Based on this background, this paper discusses on the seismic vulnerability of masonry fortresses by means of an analysis methodology based on three different analytical procedures, according to an increased knowledge of the structure. As a relevant case study the Albornoz fortress, a 14th stone masonry construction located in central Italy, was selected. Initially, the strategy proposed to perform this task was aimed at testing and developing an expeditious and non-destructive procedure to evaluate both the seismic vulnerability and the main mechanical properties of the different masonry typologies. The macroscale structural behavior of the fortress was then evaluated through a nonlinear static analysis (pushover) and a more simple approach based on the kinematic theorems of the limit analysis. From this point of view, by comparing the capacity of the construction to withstand lateral loads with the expected demands resulting from seismic actions, these methods provided a highly effective means of verifying the safety of the masonry structure and its vulnerability to extensive damage and collapse. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",A numerical study on seismic damage of masonry fortresses,2018,Damage assessment  Fortified buildings  Historic masonry  Kinematic analysis  Masonry modelling  Nonlinear static analysis,Damage detection  Historic preservation  Kinematics  Masonry materials  Seismology  Static analysis  Damage assessments  Historic masonry  Kinematic Analysis  Masonry modelling  Non-linear static analysis  Structural analysis  building construction  collapse  masonry  mechanical property  methodology  monument  numerical method  structural analysis  vulnerability  Italy,0,1

12542,"Seismic shocks occur sometimes as a sequence, close in space and time, of destructive events of comparable intensity. In these cases, a significant portion of the damage to historical buildings can be related with the cumulated damage on structures that become progressively more vulnerable. This research investigates the specific increase of damage determined by a sequence of strong ground motions, focusing the interest on the out-of-plane response of 2 church masonry facades. The dynamic analyses were performed by a specific rigid body and spring model RBSM, which only accounts for out-of-plane damage mechanisms. Two idealized models of facade, each made of 2 different masonry bonds, have been studied by applying various sequences of recorded accelerograms. The results highlighted a complex relationship between the spectral content of the seismic shocks and the characteristics of the structures that change in the course of the loading sequence due to the development of damage. The Housner spectral intensity proved to be a reliable scalar measure of the ground motion destructiveness for these facades. Moreover, when considering a design-consistent accelerogram that causes a relevant damage pattern, ie, with a significant elongation of the effective first period of vibration, the numerical results indicated a possible spectral intensity threshold below which the occurrence of repeated seismic shocks, both before and after the reference design shock, can be considered as irrelevant. On the other hand, a catastrophic increase of damage should be expected when this threshold is overcome.",A numerical study on the cumulative out-of-plane damage to church masonry facades due to a sequence of strong ground motions,2017,cumulative damage assessment  dynamics  masonry  out-of-plane  repeated earthquakes  rigid body spring model,SEISMIC PERFORMANCE  REPEATED EARTHQUAKE  NONLINEAR RESPONSE  SDOF SYSTEMS  WALLS  BUILDINGS  BEHAVIOR  MODEL  STATE  VULNERABILITY,0,1
12546,"Probabilistic-based type of analysis seems to constitute a state-of-art approach for earthquake engineers. Such strategy is, in the analysis of potential retrofitting measures for a building (or typology), needed for the development of vulnerability or fragility curves. This information is recognized to be extremely valuable within the decision process, since it allows the evaluation of the collapse probability (or other defined limit state) of a given structure under a given intensity measure. The computational development integrated with the advent of proper working methodologies led to the increasing of research in the field. Nevertheless, the current numerical FE-based modelling approaches are still cumbersome for the dynamic analysis of the masonry behavior. In this scope, a novel stochastic methodology, based on the Latin Hypercube Sampling, using homogenization concepts for the masonry characterization and employing a discrete-FE based model is herein presented. Both running- and English-bond masonry textures are suitable to be studied, being the system uncertainty considered on parameters affecting the material, mechanical, geometrical and loading conditions. The approach has been implemented on an English-bond masonry mockup tested on a shaking table in LNEC. An incremental dynamic analysis has been performed and fragility curves derived. It has been shown that the strategy is effective, accurate and very attractive from a computation point of view. Copyright © 2019 COMPDYN Proceedings.

12548,"The current research focuses on a numerical and analytical study aimed at investigating the efficiency of a steel-based reinforcement system suitable for existing masonry walls. The application of such a retrofitting technique, which consists of glued thin steel grids applied on both faces of a masonry panel, is reversible, cheap and easy to be executed and appears to be suitable especially for buildings with concrete slab or inter-stories beams to which the steel elements could be anchored. The study is based on a reference experimental test carried out at the Politehnica University of Timisoara (Romania), within the European FP6 project PROHITECH. The reference test provided the application of a constant vertical compression and cyclic horizontal displacements to an unreinforced brick-cement mortar wall in full-scale (1500 x 1500 x 250 mm), to which was conferred a double-fixed constraint condition. Based on the experimental evidences, a reference numerical model has been implemented in ABAQUS, by adopting a plastic-damage material and a macro-element approach for the masonry modelling. Hence, in order to determine a design criterion of the studied system, a comparison with the analytical formulations available in the current Italian and European codes for the unreinforced configuration is presented in this study. Then, a wide parametric study on the investigated retrofitting technique has been carried out by varying thickness and spacing of steel grid elements, as well as the geometrical ratio of the panel (height/length). On the basis of the numerical results, a capacity formulation has been proposed, which takes into account the steel distribution in the masonry panel. The obtained outcomes revealed that the strength increase achievable by adopting the studied reinforcement system could be compared to the efficiency of a reinforced masonry wall of new construction and it is strongly influenced by the geometrical ratio of the wall, as well as the steel distribution.",A retrofitting technique using steel grids for existing masonry panels: a numerical and analytical study,2021,Masonry  Shear walls  Cyclic tests  Retrofitting system  FEM analyses  Steel,PLASTIC-DAMAGE MODEL  SEISMIC RESPONSE  CONTINUUM MODEL  WALLS  BEHAVIOR  SHEAR  GFRP,0,1
12550,"A prompt and overall understanding of building damages following a disaster is critical, as they are closely related to casualties. As an important active remote sensing technology, synthetic aperture radar can be a valuable tool for assessing building damages in disasters, owing to its large coverage, quick response, non-contact, and independence of weather and light capabilities. Various approaches have been proposed for SAR-based building damage assessment with the development of radar technology and interpretation techniques. While providing numerous choices, these multifarious approaches also make it burdensome to ponder the applicable approach in a specific case, and to reflect on potential fields for further research. Accordingly, this paper hierarchically classified and summarized these approaches to provide a structured understanding of the research status in this field, for assisting in approach decisions and promising field considerations. First, depending on the pre-event data availability, the numerous approaches were classified into change detections employing both pre- and post-event data, and assessments applying only post-event data. Then, determined by the data resolution level and acquisition mode, the plentiful change detection approaches were further distinguished into block-unit approaches analyzing intensity, coherence, or polarimetry features, and building-unit approaches that simply generalize the block-unit approaches, or that concretely explore the detailed individual building features. The post-event data-based assessments, with relatively fewer approaches, were further introduced as methods exploring polarimetry or/and texture features. In each classification category, the principle was first introduced to explain the basic concept and essence of the approaches. An approach review was then provided by organizing relevant studies in a logical or structured way, to facilitate a clear understanding of the overall research status. Favorable parameters in each category were also summarized for easy reference and application in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",A review on synthetic aperture radar-based building damage assessment in disasters,2020,Block-unit  Building damage assessment  Building-unit  Coherence  Intensity  Polarimetry  Synthetic aperture radar (SAR),Buildings  Coherent light  Damage detection  Disasters  Ellipsometry  Polarimeters  Remote sensing  Textures  Acquisition modes  Block-unit  Building damage  Building units  Data availability  Intensity  Remote sensing technology  Texture features  Synthetic aperture radar  damage  disaster management  hazard assessment  polarization  remote sensing  synthetic aperture radar,0,1
12551,"Estimating earthquake losses is an important issue for many private and public bodies. As a major stakeholder, insurers need realistic probable maximum loss (PML) values to foresee the possible losses they would face after a major earthquake and also to calculate optimal insurance premiums. Insurers generally use fragility curves to manage their portfolio by calculating overall PML values. There are, however, serious impacts of risk based PML estimation on earthquake insurance rates, and in this respect fragility curves, which represent regional losses rather than individual losses, could lead to suboptimal decisions. In this study, a rapid earthquake loss estimation methodology, which can be used even by the non-experts in earthquake engineering without conducting comprehensive structural analyses, is proposed for single-storey reinforced concrete industrial buildings based on parameters determined after investigating more than 80 industrial building projects in Turkey. 384 analytical structural loss estimation curves were obtained via the non-linear structural performance analysis method proposed in the 2007 Turkish Seismic Design Code. To provide a detailed evaluation of the proposed methodology’s performance, fragility curves representative of the structural types and the design levels of the buildings investigated were also developed. Finally, total insurance premiums corresponding to PML values of the inventory buildings were calculated, using the two aforementioned estimation methods and others previously published, by addressing issues such as reinsurance cost, capital cost and profit. Results reveal considerable differences in PML values and eventually earthquake insurance rates for the buildings investigated between the risk based structural loss estimation method and the existing methods, indicating possibilities for improved portfolio analysis and management tools. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",A risk based PML estimation method for single-storey reinforced concrete industrial buildings and its impact on earthquake insurance rates,2015,Earthquake insurance rate  Earthquake loss estimation  Earthquake PML  Non-linear structural analysis  Portfolio analysis  Probable maximum loss,Earthquake resistance  Earthquakes  Estimation  Insurance  Office buildings  Reinforced concrete  Risk assessment  Risk perception  Seismic design  Earthquake engineering  Earthquake insurance  Earthquake loss estimation  Industrial buildings  Linear structural analysis  Portfolio analysis  Seismic design code  Structural performance analysis  Structural analysis  building  earthquake damage  insurance system  performance assessment  reinforced concrete  risk assessment  seismic design  stakeholder  Turkey,0,1

In this paper, the approach of multi-source geographic data integration in flood risk assessment is developed for evaluating the impact on buildings of flood disaster under given flood frequency. First, the inundation model is employed to obtain flood risk maps, including both the inundation area and depth. Then, buildings information is extracted from Landsat-TM remote sensing images.

12556,"Cementitious materials, mainly in the form of concrete, belong to a class of macroscopically heterogeneous materials. The building technology of mass concrete structures enables large-sized coarse aggregate to be used. The maximum coarse aggregate size, in conjunction with the mechanical properties of the interfacial transition zone (ITZ), have great influences on the mesoscopic crack path and the macroscopic mechanical behavior of concrete. Herein this study, based on some pioneering work (Stroeven, 2000; Rossello and Elices, 2004, Rossello et al., 2006; Elices and Rocco, 2008), the effects of varying the maximum coarse aggregate size and the ITZ strength on the global mechanical properties of concrete in direct tension are theoretically modelled from a mesoscopic point of view. The particle size effect behavior of concrete is analyzed based on the proposed theoretical method, and some general conclusions can be drawn as: (1) The degree of tortuosity of the mesoscopic crack path in direct tension increases with increasing maximum coarse aggregate size and with decreasing ITZ strength; (2) The fracture energy and the tensile strength of concrete increase dramatically with increasing ITZ strength; (3) For normal strength concrete, the fracture energy and the tensile strength decrease with increasing maximum coarse aggregate size, while for relatively high strength concrete, the trends are the opposite; (4) The properties of ITZ could significantly affect the homogeneity of concrete. High quality ITZ could make the mechanical properties of concrete more homogeneous and get a relatively high strength concrete, consequently a short characteristic length and a high brittleness number are resulted; (5) For normal strength concrete, the characteristic length increases with increasing maximum coarse aggregate size, while for relatively high strength concrete, it is fairly insensitive to the maximum coarse aggregate size. It is hoped that this theoretical method may be helpful in the study of size effect and in the design of concrete and future cementitious materials.",A theoretical method to determine the tortuous crack length and the mechanical parameters of concrete in direct tension-A particle size effect analysis,2018,Size effect  Maximum coarseaggregate size  Interfacial transition zone (ITZ)  Fracture energy  Tensile strength  Characteristic length  Brittleness  Meso-mechanical analysis,ACOUSTIC-EMISSION TECHNIQUE  SELF COMPACTING CONCRETE  QUASI-BRITTLE STRUCTURES  HIGH-STRENGTH CONCRETE  COARSE AGGREGATE SIZE  FRACTURE PROCESS ZONE  PLASTIC-DAMAGE MODEL  HIGH-STRAIN RATES  FAILURE BEHAVIOR  CEMENT PASTE,0,1
12557,"This study focuses on developing a two-step procedure for estimating the seismic response of urban area through per building analysis. The objective of the procedure is to obtain maximum value of key parameters (such as inter-story drift) needed for damage assessment by analyzing the building models in different resolutions. The first step is generation and analysis of low-resolution building models using the software, Integrated Earthquake Simulation-Structure Response Analysis (IES-SRA). The second step is analysis of high resolution models (meshed with finite element beam and solid models) subjected to static and dynamic seismic loads. Parallel computing was implemented in all the tasks involved in the procedure to distribute the large computation cost related to preprocessing, analysis, and postprocessing tasks. Per building analysis allows for specifying specific structure types for a target area. Thus, the results of the procedure are expected to have already accounted for the local distribution of different structural materials. As a demonstrative example, we performed the procedure simulating a hypothetical earthquake with magnitude, Mw=7.2 in the target cities of Metro Manila. The maximum inter-story drift values obtained in both steps were gathered for postprocessing - which included analyzing the variability as well as predicting the damage states per structure type. © (2018) by Earthquake Engineering Research Institute All rights reserved.",A two-step procedure for estimation of seismic response of urban areas in the Philippines,2018,None,Computer software  Damage detection  Earthquake engineering  Engineering geology  Seismic response  Computation costs  Damage assessments  Different resolutions  Earthquake simulation  High-resolution models  Interstory drifts  Local distributions  Two-step procedure  Earthquakes,0,1
12558,"Reinforced concrete (RC) walls are extensively used to resist lateral forces in tall buildings as well as in the majority of medium to low-rise structures designed for protective purposes. In the framework of seismic performance-based design, where an adequate modeling of the lateral load versus lateral displacement relationship and a full understanding of the damage evolution are required, numerical models represent an effective tool to conduct nonlinear response analyses of such systems. For practical applications and for performing extensive nonlinear analyses, it would be desirable to have a robust yet simple numerical model that is capable of capturing the global and local characteristics of the response for different levels of damage. To this end, this paper presents a finite element-based model implemented in OpenSees [1] capable of simulating the in-plane nonlinear static and dynamic response of RC walls across a broad range of aspect ratios. The proposed model includes (i) the element technology, in which the state-of-the-art isoparametric elements are coupled with layered sections, and (ii) a novel plane-stress plastic-damage concrete material. A simple simulation-based method for determining the concrete material parameters is proposed. Model validation is conducted through a comprehensive comparison against experimental tests collected from the literature. Results show that the proposed numerical tool can be reliably used to simulate the nonlinear global and local response of RC walls spanning a broad range of aspect ratios (from 0.4 to 2.3). Moreover, model hysteresis damping is analytically analyzed to provide modelers with insight into the equivalent damping to employ when nonlinear and equivalent linear dynamic analyses are performed with the proposed model. Finally, an extensive parametric study comprising a total of 12,288 nonlinear simulations is developed to investigate the sensitivity of the numerically predicted response to changes in the concrete model parameters and gain insight into the factors that most affect the walls peak shear and dissipated energy.",A versatile numerical model for the nonlinear analysis of squat-to-tall reinforced-concrete shear walls,2021,Nonlinear RC shear walls  Squat-to-tall shear walls  Damage concrete material  Concrete parameters calibration  Sensitivity study,PLASTIC-DAMAGE MODEL  STRESS-STRAIN MODEL  ELEMENT  BEHAVIOR  STRENGTH,0,1

12560,"Cement mortar is a widely used construction material; its mechanical behaviour is affected by the proportion of its contents and external loads. Its health condition and damage evolution can be obtained by acoustic emission (AE) monitoring. In this study, uniaxial compression and AE synchronisation tests under different loading rates for cement mortar with different cement sand ratios are carried out. Considering that the specimen still has a certain bearing capacity after failure, the concept of critical damage was introduced to modify the statistical damage evolution equation, and the damage evolution equation was fitted by using AE energy data. Finally, a statistical damage constitutive model of cement mortar considering the compaction effect of cracks was developed, and the fitted results of the models were compared to experimental data. Results showed that the critical damage value of cement mortar is approximately 0.9, and the damage constitutive model under uniaxial compression can accurately describe the relationship between strength and deformation of cement mortar with different cement sand ratios and loading rates.

12561,"Historical churches, tall ancient masonry buildings, and bell towers are structures subjected to high risks due to their age, elevation, and small base-area-to-height ratio. In this paper, the results of an innovative monitoring technique for structural integrity assessment applied to a historical bell tower are reported. The emblematic case study of the monitoring of the Turin Cathedral bell tower (northwest Italy) is herein presented. First of all, the damage evolution in a portion of the structure localized in the lower levels of the tall masonry building is described by the evaluation of the cumulative number of acoustic emissions (AEs) and by different parameters able to predict the time dependence of the damage development, in addition to the 3D localization of the AE sources. The b-value analysis shows a decreasing trend down to values compatible with the growth of localized micro and macro-cracks in the portion of the structure close to the base of the tower. These results seem to be in good agreement with the static and dynamic analysis performed numerically by an accurate FEM (finite element model). Similar results were also obtained during the application of the AE monitoring to the wooden frame sustaining the bells in the tower cell. Finally, a statistical analysis based on the average values of the b-value are carried out at the scale of the monument and at the seismic regional scale. In particular, according to recent studies, a comparison between the b-value obtained by AE signal analysis and the regional activity is proposed in order to correlate the AE detected on the structure to the seismic activity, discriminating foreshock, and aftershock intervals in the analyzed time series. © 2020 by the authors.",Acoustic emission monitoring of the turin cathedral bell tower: Foreshock and aftershock discrimination,2020,AE damage assessment  Aftershock  B-value  Bell tower  Earthquake monitoring  Foreshock  Seismicity  ßt exponent  Structural monitoring,None,0,1
12562,"The seismotectonic conditions of the Iberian Peninsula trigger the occurrence of earthquakes with an occasional periodicity, but with intensities greater than VI on the European macroseismic scale (EMS). For this reason, local action protocols are required in order to efficiently organise the technical inspections that must be carried out on a massive scale after events such as the earthquakes experienced in the Spanish cities of Lorca (2011) and Melilla (2016). This paper proposes the development of a set of documents for the evaluation and diagnosis of the state of existing buildings and infrastructure regarding seismic activity in Andalusia. With special attention paid to residential typology, approximations have been carried out to the normative context, to general comparatives, to particular analyses of a case studies selection, and to complementary approaches. The results have led to the establishment of two specific protocols. Firstly, the short-term guideline enables the classification of damage and risk levels, and the determination of what immediate interventions should be carried out through the generation of a preliminary on-site report. This activity can be performed by architects and engineers with the help of a mobile-device application (APP IT-Sismo Andalucía). Additionally, a long-term protocol provides calculation procedures and constructive solutions for the improvement of the seismic behaviour of affected buildings. Specially designed tests demonstrate the validity of the protocols and illustrate the need for information and communication technologies (ICT) tools in the evaluation of architectonic technical aspects. © 2019 by the authors.","Action protocols for seismic evaluation of structures and damage restoration of residential buildings in Andalusia (Spain): ""IT-Sismo"" APP",2019,Automatic protocols  Damage assessment  In situ structural diagnosis  Mobile-device applications  Seismic restoration,None,0,1
12564,"Remote sensing data play an important role for the environmental monitoring because they allow to provide systematic information on very large areas and for a long period of time. Such information must be analyzed, validated and incorporated into proper modeling tools in order to become useful for performing risk assessment analysis. These approaches has been already applied in the field of natural hazard evaluation (i.e. for monitoring seismic, volcanic areas and landslides). However, not enough attention has been devoted to the development of validated methods for implementing quantitative analysis on civil structures. This work is dedicated to the comprehensive utilization of ERS/ENVISAT data store ESA SAR used to detect deformation trends and perform back-analysis of the investigated structures useful to calibrate the damage assessment models. After this preliminary analysis, SAR data of the new satellite mission (ie Cosmo SkyMed) were adopted to monitor the evolution of existent surface deformation processes and to detect new occurrence. The specific objective was to set up a data processing and data analysis chain tailored on a service that sustains the safe maintenance of the built-up environment, including critical construction such as public (schools, hospital, etc), strategic (dam, highways, etc) and also the cultural heritage sites.

12565,"The seismic response and strengthening of two complex monumental masonry churches located in Northern Italy have been investigated through an advanced macro-modelling FE-based approach. An extensive documentary research and several field surveys have provided a fundamental preliminary knowledge of the two churches. Detailed three-dimensional FE models with a damage plasticity behavior for masonry have been developed and non-linear dynamic analyses have been performed to simulate the damage distribution in the churches and to identify the most vulnerable macro-elements. The analyses have highlighted the effects of geometrical features and masonry coverings on the seismic behavior of the two churches. The examination of the results in terms of tensile damage contour plots, maximum normalized displacements and energy density dissipated by tensile damage has provided a thorough description of the seismic response of both the whole church and the different macro-elements. In this regard, the procedure utilized could be regarded as a general guideline to follow for a realistic insight into the seismic response and failure analysis of large complex masonry structures without box behavior. From the results obtained, a hypothetical strengthening intervention has been implemented in the numerical models of the two churches according to the Italian Code, in order to quantitatively estimate the vulnerability reduction. A decrease of both tensile damage and displacements has been observed for the critical elements of the two churches in the case of strengthened models. Moreover, the results have shown the importance of the presence of the nave masonry covering to increase the effectiveness of the strengthening intervention, preventing the out-of-plane mechanism of the nave walls.",Advanced numerical insights into failure analysis and strengthening of monumental masonry churches under seismic actions,2019,Historical masonry church  FE model  Failure analysis under seismic action  Non-linear dynamic analysis  Damage-plasticity modelling  Strengthening intervention,PLASTIC-DAMAGE MODEL  STRUCTURAL-ANALYSIS  2009 LAQUILA  EARTHQUAKE  BEHAVIOR  VULNERABILITY  PERFORMANCE  MECHANISMS  BUILDINGS,0,1

12569,"We present a method for determining an initial assessment of tsunami risk, with application for two coastal areas of Oman. Using open source GIS and seismic databases we carry out a tsunami risk assessment using a deterministic and probabilistic approach based on worst-case scenarios. A quick and effective method for estimating tsunami run-up without the use of complex modelling software is an important step in disaster risk reduction efforts as many government and emergency response organisations do not possess the expertise to carry out or interpret tsunami inundation numerical models. Estimates of probable maximum loss were calculated using a simple method of building identification and a revised building damage assessment technique. A series of tsunami risk maps were created for the coastal settlements of Muscat and Salalah, with the aim of improving tsunami response. We find Muscat to be at far greater risk of tsunami damage than Salalah; this is due in part to Muscat's proximity to potential tsunamigenic sources and the cities current level of urban infrastructure. Whilst much of the infrastructure in Salalah is currently at low risk from tsunami, development pressures could lead to increased risk within the region. It is hoped that the assessment of risk may go some way to a government led disaster risk reduction strategy being implemented in coastal Oman. The methods detailed provide a cheap and efficient means to quantify tsunami risk in many coastal Middle Eastern countries, of which several have poor disaster risk reduction strategies. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","An assessment of the tsunami risk in Muscat and Salalah, Oman, based on estimations of probable maximum loss",2016,Disaster risk reduction  Oman  Open source GIS  Risk assessment  Tsunami hazard,None,0,1

These product maps have a rather high accuracy as they are based on high precision preprocessing results in spectral consistency and geometric, which compared with traditional fused and registration methods by visual qualitative or quantitative analysis.

12576,"Numerous debris-flow inundation models have been applied retroactively to noteworthy events around the world. While such studies can be useful in identifying controlling factors, calibrating model parameters, and assessing future hazards in specific study areas, model parameters tailored to individual events can be difficult to apply regionally. The advancement of debris-flow modeling applications from post-event model validation of individual case studies to pre-event forecasting that can be implemented rapidly and at regional scales is critical considering the fatalities and extensive infrastructure damage caused by debris flows that inundated a developed fan in Montecito, California, following heavy rain on 9 January 2018. In this study, we evaluated the tradeoffs between model accuracy and simplicity in the context of the need for a framework that can be used in conjunction with initiation models and storm predictions for rapid, large-scale inundation hazard mapping as a component of post-fire debris-flow hazard assessments. We used numerical (FLO-2D) and empirical (LAHARZ) models to simulate debris flows from one of the drainages upstream of Montecito that was burned in the Thomas fire in December 2017 and compared model results with field observations and building damage assessments collected immediately following the event. Initial testing demonstrated that LAHARZ can simulate channelized flow but is not able to replicate flow bifurcations or avulsions, which are critical aspects of flows travelling over populated fans. FLO-2D simulations matched well with observed inundation area data, but variably under- and overpredicted inundation height, deposit depth, and velocity. We found that FLO-2D and LAHARZ had true positive rates of 0.84 and 0.6, respectively, and both models had similar false positive rates (0.3 and 0.35, respectively). Our model evaluation framework allowed us to compare model results with detailed field observations and will serve as a platform for more extensive model testing in the future. © 2019 Debris-Flow Hazards Mitigation: Mechanics, Monitoring, Modeling, and Assessment - Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Debris-Flow Hazards Mitigation.

12579,"Climate change is expected to have a severe impact on cultural heritage in the future. This study presents the methodology developed during the FP7 project Climate for Culture, of assessing the climate change impact on collection objects in cultural heritage buildings.

Future indoor climate data was assessed for possible risks of biological, mechanical, and chemical damage to painted wooden panels using the newly developed specific climate risk assessment.

12581,"Rapid socioeconomic development in earthquake-prone areas can cause rapid changes in seismic loss risks. These changes make it difficult to ensure that risk reduction strategies are realistic, practical and effective over time. To overcome this difficulty, ongoing changes in risk should be captured timely, definitively, and accurately and then specific and well-timed adjustments of the relevant strategies should be made. However, methods for rapidly characterizing such seismic disaster risks over a large area have not been sufficiently developed. By focusing on building loss risks, this paper presents the development of an integrated method that combines remote sensing data and local knowledge to resolve this problem. This method includes two key interdependent steps. (1) To extract the heights and footprint areas of a large number of buildings accurately and quickly from single high-resolution optical remote sensing images; (2) To estimate the floor areas, identify structural types, develop damage probability matrixes, and determine economic parameters for calculating monetary losses due to seismic damage to the buildings by reviewing building-relevant local knowledge based on these two parameters (i.e., the building heights and footprint areas). This method is demonstrated in the Tangshan area of China. Based on the integrated method, the total floor area of the residential and public office buildings in central Tangshan in 2009 was 3.99% lower than the corresponding area number obtained by a conventional earthquake loss estimation project. Our field-based verification indicated that the mean relative error of the method for estimating the floor areas of the assessed buildings was 2.99%. A simulation of the impacts of the 1976 Ms 7.8 Tangshan earthquake using this method indicated that the total damaged floor area of the residential and public office buildings and the associated direct monetary loses in the study area could have been 8.00 and 28.73 times greater, respectively, than in 1976 if this earthquake had recurred in 2009, which is a strong warning to the local people regarding the increasing challenges they may face.","An Integrated Method Combining Remote Sensing Data and Local Knowledge for the Large-Scale Estimation of Seismic Loss Risks to Buildings in the Context of Rapid Socioeconomic Growth: A Case Study in Tangshan, China",2015,None,HIGH-RESOLUTION SATELLITE  VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT  SOCIAL VULNERABILITY  DAMAGE ASSESSMENT  URBAN AREAS  EARTHQUAKE  INFORMATION  IMAGERY  INTENSITY  SAR,0,1
12583,"Determining the structural behavior of masonry structures is a challenge due to their lack of homogeneity. The seismic behavior of masonry structures is especially complex. The aim of this study was to examine the structural behavior of Zaganos Bastion using both experimental and numerical methods. The Operational Modal Analysis technique, including the Enhanced Frequency Domain Decomposition Method, and the Stochastic Subspace Identification Method were used to illustrate experimentally the dynamic characteristic of the bastion. A finite element model was developed using ANSYS software in order that the dynamic characteristics of the bastion, including natural frequencies and mode shapes, could be calculated numerically. Seismic analysis was carried out using the 1999 Kocaeli earthquake ground motion record to determine the linear and nonlinear seismic behavior of the bastion. The Turkish Earthquake Code and its general technical specifications were used to evaluate the seismic results. The results show that the maximum and minimum principal stresses exerted on the masonry components exceeded the code requirements at some points, but in general the requirements for the stresses were satisfied.",An Investigation of the Seismic Behaviour of an Ancient Masonry Bastion Using Non-Destructive and Numerical Methods,2017,Historical masonry structures  Bastion  Seismic earthquake response  Operational modal analysis  Turkish earthquake code,EXPERIMENTAL TESTS  DAMAGE ASSESSMENT  CASTLE  CHURCH  TOWER  VULNERABILITY  PERFORMANCE  RESISTANCE  BUILDINGS  GEOMETRY,0,1
12584,"Building interstory drift (ID), which is a measure of the relative displacement between two successive floors in a vibrating building, is a key response parameter utilized in both seismic design and post-earthquake damage assessments. To this point in time, there has been no accepted methodology or sensor technology for reliable and accurate direct measurements of building drift. Indirect measurement of drift, through signal processing and double integration of accelerometer data, is fraught with challenges, particularly when inelasticity-induced permanent drifts occur. In this paper, recent developments toward a new optically-based technique for measurement of both transient interstory drift (TID(t)) and residual interstory drift (RID) are described. The ability of a newly designed laser-based optical sensor system to directly measure interstory drift is demonstrated through experimental and model-based evaluations. This sensor technology has progressed to the point where practical application is feasible as an enabling (SHM)-H-2 technology.",An Optical Technique for Measuring Transient and Residual Interstory Drift as Seismic Structural Health Monitoring ((SHM)-H-2) Observables,2019,SHM  Seismic monitoring  Interstory drift  Damage detection  Optical sensor development  Structural damage,MEMS-BASED ACCELEROMETER  STRONG-MOTION DURATION  SENSOR  DESIGN,0,1
12586,"Seven steel-reinforced concrete (SRC) deep beams were tested to investigate the shear performance, including peak loads, failure modes, mid-span deflections, and cracking patterns. The parameters include the shear span-to-depth ratio and the dimensions of the steel skeleton. The digital image correlation (DIC) technique was utilized for real-time recording of the in-plane strain and deformation. The experiment results show that the failure modes of specimens could be concluded as two forms: diagonal compression failure and shear failure. The DIC technique was proved to be efficient for tracking the development of crack patterns and recording the failure modes. The corresponding numerical analyses based on experiments were carried out and demonstrated to be a reliable method to simulate the shear response. Furthermore, the most significant parameters and their interactions were identified by finite element models parameter analysis. The steel skeleton height and shear span-to-depth ratio were the main parameters affecting shear capacity. A design formula based on the strength superposition method was presented. The calculated results were basically in agreement with the test results, where the mean and coefficient of variation were 1.04 and 0.09, respectively.","Analysis for Shear Behavior of SRC Deep Beams Based on Tests, Digital Image Correlation Technique, and Finite Elemental Simulation",2021,None,PLASTIC-DAMAGE MODEL  STRENGTH PREDICTION  SEISMIC BEHAVIOR  TIE MODEL  CONCRETE  COLUMNS,0,1
12588,"The Cyclone Testing Station (CTS) and partners have conducted forensic damage assessments in Australia following severe windstorm events for over four decades. The information collected is used for building science research that provides the evidence base needed for improvements to building codes and development of damage mitigation solutions. The Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) operate Rapid Damage Assessment (RDA) teams in the aftermath of major disasters (e.g. cyclone and bushfire) to collect and disseminate information on extent of damage to buildings in impacted communities. These data enables focused and coordinated response in the immediate aftermath of an event and better planning for event recovery. This paper explores the use of QFES RDA datasets in analysing the damaging effects of severe windstorm events. Two case studies are discussed: a supercell that hit Brisbane on 27 November 2014 and Tropical Cyclone Debbie that made landfall along the northern Queensland coastline in March 2017. Where possible, damage data are combined with hazard information (dual-Doppler radar horizontal wind fields) and their relationship is investigated. The analysis demonstrates that RDA data are not only useful in response and recovery phases, but also have value for research aiming to better understand building failures and reduce damage in future events. © AJEM Australian Journal of Emergency Management, 2017.",Analysis of rapid damage assessment data following severe windstorm events,2017,None,article  emergency health service  human  Queensland  telecommunication,0,1

Different levels of cladding panel damage are introduced and a specific cladding panel hysteretic model is included in the structural model and calibrated on available data from experimental tests. Numerical results from nonlinear dynamic analyses are elaborated in the form of fragility curves for the damage limit state and used to compare the consequences of different cladding behaviours on prototype single-storey industrial steel buildings used as case studies.

12594,"Given the growing spread of glass as a construction material, the knowledge of structural response must be ensured, especially under dynamic accidental loads. In this regard, an increasingly popular method to probabilistically characterize the seismic response of a given structure is based on the use of “fragility” or “seismic vulnerability” curves. Most existing applications, however, typically refer to construction and structural members composed of traditional building materials. The present study extends and adapts such a calculation method to innovative structural glass systems, which are characterized by specific material properties and expected damage mechanisms, restraint details, and dynamic features. Suitable Engineering Demand Parameters (EDPs) for seismic design are thus required. In this paper, a major advantage is represented by the use of Cloud Analysis in the Cornell’s reliability method, for the seismic assessment of two different case-study glass systems. Cloud Analysis is known to represent a simple and immediate tool to analytically investigate a given (glass) structure by taking into account variations in seismic motions and uncertainties of structural parameters. Such a method is exploited by means of detailed three-dimensional (3D) Finite Element (FE) numerical models and non-linear dynamic analyses (ABAQUS/Standard). Critical issues and typical failure mechanisms for in-plane seismically loaded glass systems are discussed. The validity of reference EDPs are addressed for the examined solutions. Based on a broad seismic investigation (60 records in total), fragility curves are developed from parametric results, so as to support a multi-hazard performance-based design (PBD) procedure. © 2021 by the authors.

12596,"Soil structure interaction (SSI) may affect significantly the seismic vulnerability of structures with several mechanisms that depend on the mutual effects of soil properties and structural characteristics. A probabilistic-based approach is here applied to evaluate the effects of SSI on the fragility assessment of two selected benchmark buildings: a Reinforced Concrete with Infill Masonry Walls (RCIMW) and a Reinforced Concrete (RC). Analytical fragility curves were developed by performing non-linear 3D numerical simulations with Opensees that implements hysteretic materials and advanced plasticity models for representing non-linear soil conditions and structural configurations. The effects of soil deformability and structural flexibility on the non-linear response of the system (soil-foundation-structure) were assessed and discussed by referring to four limit states (slight, moderate, extensive and collapse) with respect to the maximum inter storey drifts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Analytical fragility curves of shallow-founded structures subjected to Soil-Structure Interaction (SSI) effects,2021,Analytical fragility curves  Non-linearity  Numerical simulations  Opensees  Soil structure interaction,Concrete construction  Soil structure interactions  Soils  Walls (structural partitions)  3-D numerical simulation  Fragility assessment  Hysteretic materials  Seismic vulnerability  Soil-Structure Interaction effects  Structural characteristics  Structural configurations  Structural flexibilities  Reinforced concrete  analytical framework  computer simulation  infill  numerical model  reinforced concrete  seismic response  soil-structure interaction  structural response,0,1
12597,"A fundamental tool in seismic risk assessment of transportation systems is the fragility curve, which describes the probability that a structure will reach or exceed a certain damage state for a given ground motion intensity. Fragility curves are usually represented by two-parameter (median and log-standard deviation) cumulative lognormal distributions. In this paper, a numerical approach, in the spirit of the IDA, is applied for the development of fragility curves for highways and railways on embankments and in cuts due to seismic shaking. The response of the geo-construction to increasing levels of seismic intensity is evaluated using a 2D nonlinear finite element model, with an elasto-plastic criterion to simulate the soil behavior. A calibration procedure is followed in order to account for the dependency of both the stiffness and the damping to the soil strain level. The effect of soil conditions and ground motion characteristics on the response of the embankment and cut is taken into account considering different typical soil profiles and seismic input motions. This study will provide input for the assessment of the vulnerability of the road/railway network regarding the performance of the embankments and cuts; therefore, the level of damage is described in terms of the permanent ground displacement in these structures. The fragility curves are estimated based on the evolution of damage with increasing earthquake intensity, which is described by PGA. The proposed approach allows the evaluation of new fragility curves considering the distinctive features of the element's geometry, the input motion, and the soil properties as well as the associated uncertainties. A relationship between the computed permanent ground displacement on the surface of the embankment and the PGA in the free field is also suggested based on the results of the numerical analyses. Finally, the proposed fragility curves are compared with existing empirical data and the limitations of their applicability are outlined.

12598,"The point fixed glass facade system is popular and considered a more elegant facade option compared to the framed glass facade system mainly for storefront, walkways and lobby areas in buildings. Point fixed glass facade system is fixed to the support structure using special bolt fittings and structural spider arms. Generally, the racking performance of these systems is not considered at the design stage in low to moderate seismic region and the system may be vulnerable if there is insufficient in-plane drift capacity compared with the demand imposed during earthquakes and wind actions. A unique full-scale in-plane racking laboratory test on a typical point fixed glass facade system was conducted and a maximum drift of 2.1% was measured before catastrophic failure. Non-linear finite element models were then developed and benchmarked against experimental results. The experimental results and finite element analyses indicated that a significant amount of the drift capacity was attributed to the rigid body translation in the facade system connections at the built-in oversize holes provided for construction tolerances. In this article, the laboratory test setup and the experimental results are summarised, and the finite element modelling methodology and non-linear analysis approach undertaken using ANSYS for the experimental test are discussed along with number of parametric studies.",Analytical study of point fixed glass facade systems under monotonic in-plane loading,2016,ANSYS  facade systems  finite element modelling  in-plane drift capacity  point fixed glass,DAMAGE ASSESSMENT  BUILDINGS,0,1

12608,"There has been a long-standing desire to identify classes or groupings of buildings that exhibit similar characteristics in response to seismic events. Regional earthquake loss models, post-earthquake safety evaluations, and rapid visual screening of buildings for potential seismic hazards all utilize building damage patterns in some form. Difficulty arises in characterizing seismic building damage due to the inherent uncertainty in both the occurrence of seismic events and uncertainties related to building responses. Various trends in building performance, often based on building characteristics, are frequently listed in the literature. For example, older structures are expected to perform less well than those designed to more recent design codes; however, it remains difficult to characterize building damage due to the rarity and somewhat limited documentation of earthquake building damage. The earthquake engineering field, in its current state, is dominated by probabilistic and/or deterministic frameworks to approach this problem. Although both frameworks have yielded significant contributions to building damage assessment, they are limited in their ability to relate engineering parameters to physical building damage observations that are often expressed linguistically. Other theories under the umbrella of Generalized Information Theory offer different mathematical models and philosophical approaches to this problem. This research utilizes mathematical formulations different from probability theory for incorporating uncertain information in the context of building damage assessment. This research aims to investigate the following question: Does empirical evidence support suggested linguistic general trends of building damage from seismic events, and if so, can this empirically-based information be used to associate potentially seismic hazardous conditions to buildings in understandable terms by end users? To investigate these questions, tools within the domain of fuzzy classification and fuzzy pattern recognition are used with post-earthquake building damage data to determine the existence or nonexistence of building damage patterns. Data from the 1994 Northridge earthquake for concrete structures have been used to mathematically model linguistic building damage patterns based on important building features. A comparison of the damage patterns developed by the classification analysis included herein to linguistic descriptions listed in the literature is also investigated. Although the linguistic patterns are limited by the available data, the potential for systematically representing and processing of subjective assessments of building damage in linguistic form offers a powerful framework for modeling nonrandom uncertainties that are intrinsically different from probability theory. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Application of Fuzzy Pattern Recognition of Seismic Damage to Concrete Structures,2015,None,Buildings  Classification (of information)  Concrete buildings  Concrete construction  Concretes  Damage detection  Earthquake engineering  Earthquakes  Geophysics  Hazards  Information theory  Linguistics  Pattern recognition  Philosophical aspects  Probability  Seismic response  Seismology  Structural analysis  Uncertainty analysis  Building characteristics  Classification analysis  Earthquake building damage  Earthquake safety evaluation  Fuzzy pattern recognition  Linguistic descriptions  Mathematical formulation  Philosophical approaches  Structural design,0,1
12609,"Knowledge about the cause of differential structural damages following the occurrence of hazardous hydro-meteorological events can inform more effective risk management and spatial planning solutions. While studies have been previously conducted to describe relationships between physical vulnerability and features about building properties, the immediate environment and event intensity proxies, several key challenges remain In particular, observations, especially those associated with high magnitude events, and studies designed to evaluate a comprehensive range of predictive features are both limited. To build upon previous developments, we described a workflow to support the continued development and assessment of empirical, multivariate physical vulnerability functions based on predictive accuracy. Within this workflow, we evaluated several statistical approaches, namely generalized linear models and their more complex alternatives. A series of models were built 1) to explicitly consider the effects of dimension reduction, 2) to evaluate the inclusion of interaction effects between and among predictors, 3) to evaluate an ensemble prediction method for applications where data observations are sparse, 4) to describe how model results can inform about the relative importance of predictors to explain variance in expected damages and 5) to assess the predictive accuracy of the models based on prescribed metrics. The utility of the workflow was demonstrated on data with characteristics of what is commonly acquired in ex-post field assessments.

12610,"STORMTOOLS coastal environmental risk index (CERI) was applied to communities located along the southern coast of Rhode Island (RI) to determine the risk to structures located in the flood plain. CERI uses estimates of the base flood elevation (BFE), explicitly including the effects of sea level rise (SLR); details on the structure types, from the E911 emergency data base/parcel data, and associated first floor elevation (FFE); and damage curves from the US Army Corp of Engineers North Atlantic Coast Comprehensive Study (NACCS) to determine the damages to structures for the study area. Surge levels and associated offshore waves used to determine BFEs were obtained from the NACCS hydrodynamic and wave model predictions. The impacts of sea level rise and coastal erosion on flooding were modeled using XBeach and STWAVE and validated by observations at selected locations along the coastline. CERI estimated the structural damage to each structure in the coastal flood plain for 100 yr flooding with SLR ranging from 0 to 10 ft. The number of structures at risk was estimated to increase approximate linearly from 3700 for no SLR to about 8000 for 10 ft SLR, with about equal percentages for each of the four coastal communities (Narragansett, South Kingstown, Charlestown, and Westerly, Rhode Island (RI). The majority of the structures in the flood plain are single/story residences without (41%) and with (46%) basements (total 87%; structures with basements are the most vulnerable). Less vulnerable are structures elevated on piles with 8.8% of the total. The remaining are commercial structures principally located either in the Port of Galilee and or Watch Hill. The analysis showed that about 20% of the structures in the 100 yr flood plain are estimated to be damaged at 50% or greater. This increases to 55% of structures as SLR rises to 5 ft. At higher SLR values the percent damaged at 50% or greater slowly declines to 45% at 10 ft SLR. This behavior is a result of the number of homes below MSL increasing dramatically as SLR values moves higher than 5 ft and thus being removed from the structures damaged pool. Generalized CERI risk maps have developed to allow the managers to determine the broad risk of siting structures at any location in their communities.

12613,"WARED system is Internet-based software that automatically receives the seismic information from Iran seismic center (ISC) every 30. s. The information is processed in a few seconds and damage assessment maps of various parts of the city (such as buildings, hospitals, bridges, etc.) become available, in layered format, to rescue groups through system site. Rescue groups, in addition to receiving probable damage assessment from the system, are capable of loading their field observations of actual damages caused by the earthquake on their system. The system, through organizing volunteer groups of people, takes advantage of these energetic, motivated and capable aid groups to help the affected people.WARED system has been designed with three aims of reducing casualties, integrating aid assistance and sending necessary information to the municipal management and private voluntary groups (PVO), within the time-limit after the earthquake. This system has four main indicators which makes it different from other systems. 1. Ability to work with minimum information (magnitudes and locations of earthquakes). 2. No need to install expensive equipment (accelerometer). 3. The operationalization capability in a short time (6 months). 4.

Delivering an effective response requires quick and precise analyses concerning the impact of a disastrous event. With the current technological developments to acquire massive volumes of data and the recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, now more than ever, disaster information integration and fusion have the potential to deliver enhanced situational awareness tools for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief efforts. Given the aerial images of a residential building taken before and after a natural disaster, recent applications of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) work well when differentiating two types of damage (i.e., whether the structure is intact or destroyed) but underperform when trying to differentiate more damage levels. According to our findings: (1) including enough surrounding context provides essential visual clues that help the model better predict the building's level of damage and (2) learning the correspondence between the features extracted from pre-And post-imagery boosts the performance compared to a simple concatenation.

12619,"The impacts of floods on housing are increasing due to more frequent and severe weather events as well as the ongoing development of settlements in flood-prone areas together with the rising vulnerability of assets at risk. Therefore, the improvement of the resilience properties of buildings to better cope with flooding has become a key issue towards more flood resilient cities in European research in recent years. The implementation of flood resilience technologies (FReT) on the individual property scale provides a previously untapped potential to reduce flood damage to buildings due to insufficient transparency of their effects. To overcome this obstacle, the paper presents a four-step extension of a synthetic approach for flood vulnerability analysis to provide evidence on the potential effects of FReT uptake concerning flood damage mitigation. The proposed approach has been integrated in the GIS-based flood damage simulation model HOWAD to support the assessment of FReT alternatives.

12620,"In recent years, shape memory alloy (SMA) have drawn significant attention and interests among researchers and structural engineers for diverse civil engineering applications. Superelasticity, shape memory effect, and hysteretic damping, are the three major attributes of SMAs that make them ideally suited for applications in concrete frames. Among different compositions of SMA, Nickel-Titanium (NiTi) SMA has gained much attention for its superior mechanical and thermal performance over other compositions. However, the high cost and low machinability restricts the widespread use of NiTi SMAs in structural applications. Recently, several compositions of SMAs have been developed, such as Fe-based and Cu-based SMAs, which offer significantly lower cost and superior machinability compared to commonly used NiTi SMAs. The objective of this study is to evaluate the comparative seismic collapse safety of concrete beam-column joints reinforced with five different SMAs. The beam-column joint is assumed to be part of a seven storey moment resistant frame building located in Dhaka, Bangladesh. A total of 20 near fault and far field ground motions will be considered for developing the collapse fragility curves.

12622,"Earthquake engineering is a major consideration for structures along the west coast of North America. The current building code of Canada is based on design criteria, which are defined by stresses and member forces calculated from prescribed levels of applied lateral shear force. Traditional wood-frame buildings are known to perform well in earthquakes. However, with the development of new engineered wood products, such as CLT (cross-laminated timber) and more consideration to build higher than the existing six stories limit in wood-frame structures, highlights the need to use innovative hybrid techniques for buildings. Hybrid buildings with steel frame structures incorporated with CLT infill walls offer one possible solution to residential and commercial multi-level buildings to overcome the height limitation. In order to make such a structure applicable for an earthquake prone area, it is important to understand the structural performance of the connection between steel and CLT elements. In this research, six connection combinations have been tested and modeled in a finite element program. The load-displacement test results are assessed with two evaluation methods. The first method follows the American Society of Testing Method, where ductility ratio, elastic shear stiffness, and the EEEP-curve (equivalent energy elastic-plastic curve) are generated and assessed. The second method follows an energy-based accumulation principle, where the test results are used to calculate a damage index at each time step. Both methods are used to compare test and model results and assess the accuracy of the model as well as addressing the capability of each assessment method. Depending on the purpose of the model one or the other assessment method might be suitable. For an analysis of the overall ductility or elastic shear stiffness, applying the method provided by ASTM will give relatively accurate results to assess a hysteretic load-displacement model such as the SAWS model in this research. The assessment with a damage accumulation method is a great tool to capture more details of the hysteretic load-displacement curve.

12623,"Climate change-induced floods in tropical urban areas have presented a serious global challenge because of failed conventional stormwater management practices. This research aims to develop a comprehensive methodological framework for flood damage estimation and mitigation, particularly in a tropical urban city. In this study, interdisciplinary fields were integrated through statistical downscaling, hydrologic-hydraulic modeling, and the development of flood damage curves. Relationships between tangible flood damage and flood-borne outbreak with flood depths were elucidated to predict future damage. Various flood mitigation strategies were evaluated. Herein, Hat Yai Municipality in Southern Thailand was selected as the study area. The flood simulation was conducted for 2010 and the highest flood damage sensitivity was exhibited by non-commercial buildings due to significant commercial stock damage, which was followed by that observed for detached houses. There was a strong linear relationship between the number of patients infected with leptospirosis and flood depth (R2 = 0.85). For climate change studies, flood maps for storms with 20-, 50-, and 100-year return periods under the A2/RCP8.5 scenario were generated using hydrological-hydraulic 1D/2D model; these maps were applied with the developed flood damage curves for damage estimation. It was found that reducing flood damage by implementing agroforestry and expanding the main bypass channel provides comparable damage reductions of −25.5% and − 27.5%, respectively, under the worst-case scenario of a 100-year return period in 2040–2059. Therefore, to deal with uncertain climate change situations, the incorporation of structural and non-structural measures is recommended. Such a combination when coupled with an eight-hour flood awareness time can result in a damage reduction of −59.9%. A flood warning system was in high demand by residents in the area; however, damage reduction from this measure alone was not high (approximately −17.0%) when compared to that obtained with other measures; consequently, additional measures were needed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Assessment and mitigation of tangible flood damages driven by climate change in a tropical city: Hat Yai Municipality, southern Thailand",2021,Flood mitigation  Flood-borne diseases  General circulation model  Hydrologic-hydraulic model  Statistical downscaling  Urban flood damage,Climate change  Damage detection  Hurricanes  Hydraulic models  Office buildings  Storms  Tropics  Damage curves  Damage estimation  Damage reduction  Flood mitigation  Flood-borne disease  General circulation model  Hydrologic-hydraulic model  Southern Thailand  Statistical downscaling  Urban flood damage  Floods  climate change  disaster management  flood damage  flood deposit  general circulation model  hydrological modeling  mitigation  natural hazard  research work  Hat Yai  Songkhla  Southern Region  Thailand  city  climate change  flooding  human  hydrology  Thailand  Cities  Climate Change  Floods  Humans  Hydrology  Thailand,0,1
12624,"The present study develops a more efficient method for the accurate modeling of nonlinear behavior of structural elements, being an essential ingredient in reliable assessment of collapse fragility curve, as an important issue in the performance-based earthquake engineering. To this end, beams and columns are often simulated by lumped plasticity models, consisting of one elastic element and two nonlinear spring elements at two ends to consider the effects of strength and stiffness degradation. Since introducing spring elements is obviously associated with the correct estimation of axial load ratio of each structural component during nonlinear dynamic analysis, the specific aim of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of any variation in the generated axial forces (axial efforts) in the elements on structural seismic response. For this purpose, fuzzy set theory has been utilized to assess the median of collapse fragility curves as fuzzy number by well-known α-cut approach. Then, herein, genetic algorithm has been employed to search for the maximum and minimum of this median in each membership degree α. Application of this methodology is illustrated through an example. It is shown that the primary advantage of the proposed assessment processes is to incorporate the influence of record to record variability, as aleatory uncertainty, and fuzziness in axial effort of the structural elements, as epistemic uncertainty, on the estimation of more realistic responses for structural systems with cyclic behavior and the evaluation of collapse performance of reinforced concrete buildings under seismic loads. © 2018 fib.

12626,"This paper presents an original methodology for the rapid assessment of potential building damage caused by an excavation. The combination of the Ground-work Impact (GI), in terms of induced greenfield displacements, and the Building Vulnerability (BV) form the basis for the GIBV damage assessment method. Both short- and long-term displacements are considered in the impact evaluation. In addition to short-term displacement due to undrained shear deformations, groundwater drawdown can result in significant consolidation settlements at considerable distance from the excavation site. In the proposed method for soft soil ground conditions, the short-term excavation-induced settlement is derived using empirical expressions and long-term displacement is estimated by coupling empirically-derived relationships for excavation-induced groundwater drawdown with a soil stratification model and consolidation theory. The building vulnerability is assessed by considering different physical characteristics and conditions of the buildings. The GIBV method has been implemented in a GIS tool to predict damage classes for buildings exposed to excavation-induced settlements. Two different case studies in Norway were used to test the reliability of the predictions of the tool and validate the methodology. A comparison between the predicted damage classes with the back-calculated ones shows a relatively high accuracy of the methodology. Moreover, the coupled model, which considers both impact and vulnerability for the damage assessment of buildings, has a higher accuracy and lower overestimation rate compared to the results obtained by just considering the impact.",Assessment of building damage due to excavation-induced displacements: The GIBV method,2021,Risk assessment  Impact  Vulnerability  Building damage  Deep excavation  Contingency table,SEISMIC VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT  GROUND SURFACE SETTLEMENT  WALL CONSTRUCTION  MASONRY BUILDINGS  MOVEMENTS  PREDICTION  BEHAVIOR,0,1
12627,"In the city of Cusco and in other parts of Peruvian Andes, adobe masonry is the primary construction material. Adobe continues to be used for the construction of housing because of its low cost, its thermal properties, the use of unskilled labor, and the local traditions of the Peruvian highlands. The Peruvian National Statistics Office estimates that 67% of rural housing in Cusco is made of adobe masonry. Besides, previous seismic events and laboratory tests demonstrated that adobe dwellings without reinforcement are prone to collapse during an earthquake. Therefore, seismic vulnerability assessment of this type of dwellings is necessary aiming at developing proper contingency and mitigation risk policies. Then, fragility curves constitute a key tool when conducting seismic loss assessment because they provide information regarding the probability of exceeding a certain damage limit state as a function of a given engineering demand parameter. This work aims at developing fragility curves, combining in-plane and outof- plane loading conditions, for typical adobe buildings located in the city of Cusco. Initially, a set of one- and two-story adobe houses were studied to determine the geometrical characteristics of representative local building typologies. Subsequently, 1,000 artificial buildings were generated by means of Monte Carlo simulation based on the information gathered. The structural capacity of each artificial building was represented by simplified bilinear and trilinear capacity curves for in-plane and out-of plane mechanisms, respectively. In order to represent the characteristics associated with sub duction processes, a set of ground motion records was established. The damage state of each building was assessed for each seismic record, and this information was collected into a Probability Damage Matrix (DPM). Finally, fragility curves were fitted for each damage state of the cumulative DPM. Preliminary results show that one- and two story adobe dwellings have a probability of collapse of 30 and 60%, respectively, when considering a peak ground acceleration of 0.30 g, which corresponds to the expected acceleration related to a return period of 475 years over a soil type 2 according to the Peruvian Standards. © 2020 Sumerente, Lovon, Tarque and Chácara.",Assessment of combined in-plane and out-of-plane fragility functions for adobe masonry buildings in the peruvian andes,2020,Adobe  Capacity curves  In-plane failure  Out-of-plane failure  Seismic vulnerability,None,0,1
12628,"The evaluation of earthquake damage considering past events can be a useful tool to verify or calibrate damage and risk models, as well as to assess the possible consequences that future events may cause in a region. This study describes a process to estimate earthquake damage considering past events, and using the OpenQuake-engine, the open-source software for seismic hazard and risk analysis of the Global Earthquake Model Foundation. Exposure and fragility models from the recently completed South America Risk Assessment (SARA) project were combined with conditioned ground motion fields from past events to calculate structural damage in the affected region. These results can facilitate the creation of risk reduction measures, such as retrofitting campaigns, development of insurance mechanisms and enhancement of building codes.

12630,"Most of existing steel multi-storey frames in Europe have been designed before the introduction of modern seismic design provisions, hence they often exhibit low performance under earthquake loads due to their low lateral resistance and energy dissipation capacity. In addition, such structures often include rigid and brittle masonry infill walls that highly influence their lateral response and distribution of damage pattern. However, current procedures for the assessment of existing steel buildings in Europe, included in the Eurocode 8 - Part 3 (EC8-3), do not provide adequate guidance for the assessment of 'weak' steel frame with masonry infill walls. Moreover, most of available modelling approaches of masonry infills formerly developed for reinforced concrete (RC) structures do not properly represent the behaviour of infill walls in steel frames. An improved numerical has to be provided to satisfactorily mimic infill walls' behaviour in steel moment frames. To this end, an experi-mental and theoretical study was carried out within the framework of HITFRAMES (i.e., HybrId Testing of an Existing Steel Frame with Infills under Multiple EarthquakeS) SERA project. This paper firstly presents the limitations of current EC8-3 by conducting a code-based assessment on a case study steel moment frame using pushover analysis. Three different single strut models, widely used for simulating the presence of masonry infills in RC structures, are considered for the numerical analyses. The paper also presents the results of pseudo-dynamic (PsD) tests performed on a large-scale 3D steel frame with masonry infills. The capability of the different masonry infill models is successively evaluated by comparisons between numerical and experimental results. On the basis of the obtained results, recommendations on how to potentially improve the single strut model for masonry infills surrounded by steel frames are also provided.","Assessment of existing steel frames: Numerical study, pseudo-dynamic testing and influence of masonry infills",2021,Existing steel frames  Seismic performance  Pseudo-dynamic testing  Masonry infills  Single-strut model,DAMAGE ASSESSMENT  PERFORMANCE  BUILDINGS  MODEL,0,1

The dynamic behavior of the building was analyzed by means of empirical and numerical approaches. The displacement response of the building submitted to ambient noise was recorded by using a Real Aperture Radar (RAR). This approach provides a secure remote sensing procedure that does not require entering the building. Based on the blueprints and other available graphical information about the building, a numeric 3D model was also set up, allowing obtaining capacity spectra and fragility curves in the two main resistant directions of the building. The main purpose of this study was to check out the feasibility of the RAR-based method to detect the safety state of a damaged building after an earthquake, without the need of entering unsafe structures. A good consistency of the numerical and experimental approaches and the observed damage was obtained, showing that RAR interferometric-based tools may provide promising supplementary remote sensing methods to safely survey and report about the structural health and the operative conditions of buildings in post-earthquake scenarios.",Assessment of Post-Earthquake Damaged Building with Interferometric Real Aperture Radar,2019,seismic damage  seismic fragility  remote sensing  real aperture radar  capacity spectrum  Lorca earthquake,REINFORCED-CONCRETE BUILDINGS  MODAL IDENTIFICATION  RC BUILDINGS  HEALTH STATE  CAPACITY  STORY  VULNERABILITY  HERITAGE  SENSOR,0,1
12633,"A large number of low to moderate earthquake incidents have been witnessed in the northern and western parts of Thailand. These incidents usually lead to various damage levels in various structures. Therefore, a sufficient lateral force resisting structures should be designed for the construction in such earthquake-prone areas. This paper presents the relevance of using a typical composite wide U beam-column system for mitigation of structural failure and collapse from the seismic hazard in Thailand. The investigated composite structural system consists of precast U beams, precast columns, and cast-in-situ concrete over the precast U beams and in the joint regions. The system also includes post-tensioning in the cast-in-situ area of the composite beams. The system has widely been used in low-to mid-rise commercial building in Thailand. In order to scrutinize the seismic performance of the system, a half-scale specimen of the post-tensioned precast U beam-column joint was tested under an incremental displacement-controlled lateral cyclic load. The laboratory test revealed the drift capacity, damage pattern, strain development in the rebars etc. of the precast wide U beam-column interior joint. Based on the obtained drift capacity, displacement-based assessment of the system was carried out. In addition, the observed damages on the tested structure were evaluated using damage grading criteria for building subjected to earthquake. The assessment showed a high potential of the post-tensioned precast wide U beam-column system to mitigate the structural failure and collapse from the earthquake hazard. However, some improvements in the current seismic performance of the system are required to employ the system in high seismic zones. © 2021 ASEAN University Network/Southeast Asia Engineering Education Development Network.

12634,"Sustainable development studies have recently begun to consider damage loss attributable to natural hazards. A sustainable perspective on building design entails an understanding of a structure's life-cycle environmental costs and consideration of the associated environmental impacts induced by natural hazards. Damage repair costs lead to additional material and energy consumption, creating harmful environmental impacts. Merging the results obtained from a natural hazard evaluation and related environmental impacts for buildings in seismically prone areas provides a novel outlook for sustainable design decisions. To evaluate the environmental impacts caused by buildings, the long-term effects accrued throughout a building's lifetime and the effects associated with damage repair need to be quantified. A literature review and a proposed method for this type of analysis have been developed and are discussed. Using Athena and HAZUS-MH software, this study evaluated the performance of steel and concrete buildings by considering their life-cycle assessments and earthquake resistance. This study determined that code design level greatly affects building repair and damage estimations. This study presented two case-study buildings and found specific results using several assumptions. Future research recommendations were provided to make this methodology more useful in real-world applications.

12635,"Issues regarding reinforced concrete (RC) high-rise buildings involve different seismic scenarios, such as near- and far-field earthquakes, which can result in different levels and complex seismic scenario structures related to global damage. This study aims to evaluate the seismic scenario structures of a 23-storey RC high-rise building based on different damage measures and to develop a fragility curve with different limit state criteria. Six ground motions are selected to represent two seismic scenarios. Seismic scenario-based global response of the building at increasing earthquake intensity measures is adopted using incremental dynamic analysis (IDA). IDA curves and interstorey drift are used in the parametric study. The structural performance and damage measure of RC high-rise buildings are evaluated with performance-based seismic design limit state. The four performance levels proposed by ATC-43 are operational performance, immediate occupancy, life safety and collapse prevention. The IDA curves showed that near-field effect has a high frequency that gives impact at early intensity measures on building collapse compared with far-field effect. Meanwhile, interstorey drift result indicates that the near-field effect has a larger effect on building damages compared with the far-field effect. Based on the fragility curves, near-field earthquakes have a larger effect towards structural damages than far-field earthquakes. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Assessment of Seismic Scenario-Structure Based Limit State Criteria for a Reinforced Concrete High-Rise Building,2020,None,None,0,1

12638,"We propose a new convolutional neural networks method in combination with ordinal regression aiming at assessing the degree of building damage caused by earthquakes with aerial imagery. The ordinal regression model and a deep learning algorithm are incorporated to make full use of the information to improve the accuracy of the assessment. A new loss function was introduced in this paper to combine convolutional neural networks and ordinal regression. Assessing the level of damage to buildings can be considered as equivalent to predicting the ordered labels of buildings to be assessed. In the existing research, the problem has usually been simplified as a problem of pure classification to be further studied and discussed, which ignores the ordinal relationship between different levels of damage, resulting in a waste of information. Data accumulated throughout history are used to build network models for assessing the level of damage, and models for assessing levels of damage to buildings based on deep learning are described in detail, including model construction, implementation methods, and the selection of hyperparameters, and verification is conducted by experiments. When categorizing the damage to buildings into four types, we apply the method proposed in this paper to aerial images acquired from the 2014 Ludian earthquake and achieve an overall accuracy of 77.39%; when categorizing damage to buildings into two types, the overall accuracy of the model is 93.95%, exceeding such values in similar types of theories and methods.",Assessment of the Degree of Building Damage Caused by Disaster Using Convolutional Neural Networks in Combination with Ordinal Regression,2019,earthquake  rapid mapping  damage assessment  deep learning  convolutional neural networks  ordinal regression  aerial image,LUDIAN EARTHQUAKE  2003 BAM  IMAGERY  IRAN,0,1
12639,"Damage scenarios caused by the 2016 Central Italy earthquake confirmed the relevant role of interventions on masonry buildings' seismic performance, also by increasing (rather than reducing) their vulnerability. Notwithstanding, current literature procedures aimed at assigning to buildings an European Macroseismic Scale 1998 (EMS-98) vulnerability class (A to F) do not consider such influence especially referring to the several intervention techniques applied to masonry buildings since the 1980s in Italy. This impaired a proper matching of vulnerability classes to the real performances, as strengthened buildings are conventionally assigned to average vulnerability conditions (class C). In the present work, vulnerability classes are appropriately assigned to buildings in strengthened conditions, basing on the analysis of 2264 dwellings placed in 19 settlements. Inspections were carried out with a purposely developed rapid visual screening procedure. A performance-based definition of structural types considered a building's masonry quality, diaphragms' stiffness, and kind of interventions graded between downgrading and upgrading. Types with the same behaviour were grouped into vulnerability classes, in the full range from A to D, through a literature model compatible with the EMS-98. Rubble stone buildings with downgrading or worsening interventions behaved like those in original conditions (class A), whereas improved buildings typically performed like class C. Upgrading interventions led to class D, similarly to modern clay block buildings. Masonry quality influenced the classification more than diaphragms' stiffness. The empirical membership of each type to vulnerability classes was obtained, that which allowed to include variously strengthened masonry buildings within the EMS-98 framework.",Assigning the macroseismic vulnerability classes to strengthened ordinary masonry buildings: An update from extensive data of the 2016 Central Italy earthquake,2021,2016 Central Italy earthquake  Masonry buildings  Strengthening interventions  EMS-98  Vulnerability classification,SEISMIC RISK  DAMAGE ASSESSMENT  SEQUENCE  SCALE  TOWN,0,1

In this study, an automated building seismic damage assessment method using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) is introduced.

Collecting building-level damage data in the aftermath of tornadoes can improve the understanding of tornado winds, but these data are difficult to collect because of safety, time, and access constraints. This study presents and tests an automated geographic information system (GIS) method using postevent point cloud data collected by terrestrial scanners and preevent aerial images to calculate the percentage of roof and wall damage and estimate wind speeds at an individual building scale. Simulations determined that for typical point cloud density (>25∈∈points/m2), a GIS raster cell size of 40-50 cm resulted in less than 10% error in damaged roof and wall detection.

12643,"Automated remote sensing methods have not gained widespread usage for damage assessment after hurricane events, especially for low-rise buildings, such as individual houses and small businesses. Hurricane wind, storm surge with waves, and inland flooding have unique damage signatures, further complicating the development of robust automated assessment methodologies. As a step toward realizing automated damage assessment for multi-hazard hurricane events, this paper presents a mono-temporal image classification methodology that quickly and accurately differentiates urban debris from non-debris areas using post-event images. Three classification approaches are presented: spectral, textural, and combined spectral–textural. The methodology is demonstrated for Gulfport, Mississippi, using IKONOS panchromatic satellite and NOAA aerial colour imagery collected after 2005 Hurricane Katrina. The results show that multivariate texture information significantly improves debris class detection performance by decreasing the confusion between debris and other land cover types, and the extracted debris zone accurately captures debris distribution. Additionally, the extracted debris boundary is approximately equivalent regardless of imagery type, demonstrating the flexibility and robustness of the debris mapping methodology.

Therefore, the need to understand how ceiling systems perform during an earthquake is becoming increasingly important.

A series of suspension-ceiling component experiments were designed at the University of Nevada, Reno, using interlocking grid members, including 2-ft. and 4-ft. cross tees. The test specimens were first subjected to monotonic and cyclic loading to obtain their failure capacities. Then several axial capacity fragility curves (not the seismic fragility curves of ceiling systems) were developed based on axial displacement capacities as well as strength capacities of interlocking ceiling joints in the absence of ceiling panels.

12647,"The high level of damage suffered by historical structures due to the interaction between materials’ aging and seismic events that occurred during the last decade has revealed the need for developing reliable and long-lasting prevention techniques. In this context, long-term structural health monitoring (SHM) is a practice that has been spreading in recent years. A monitoring system is composed by an optimized network of sensors placed in strategic positions within the building. The data recorded by the sensors enable to track the structural behavior over time. In this study an automated Bayesian-based procedure, i.e., an inverse problem able to detect in real-time the occurrence of damage, is proposed. In particular, hourly data are periodically divided into subgroups and used for the automatic Bayesian update. The methodology can be summarized as follows: (i) preliminary calibration of a Finite Element (FE) model able to reproduce the structural dynamic behavior identified by the experimental vibration data; (ii) identification of damage-sensitive portions of the structure by performing non-linear static analyses (NLSA) on the FE model; (iii) calibration of a digital twin of the structure by surrogate modeling and definition of the sensitivity damage chart; (iv) real time Bayesian model updating of the selected uncertain parameters in order to continuously identify possible changes in the structural behavior that can be associated with a certain level of damage. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Bayesian-Based Damage Assessment of Historical Structures Using Vibration Monitoring Data,2021,Architectural heritage  Bayesian approach  Damage detection  Structural Health Monitoring,Bayesian networks  Calibration  Damage detection  Digital twin  Inverse problems  Monitoring  Structural dynamics  Uncertainty analysis  Vibration analysis  Bayesian model updating  Historical structures  Non-linear static analysis  Prevention techniques  Structural behaviors  Structural health monitoring (SHM)  Uncertain parameters  Vibration monitoring  Structural health monitoring,0,1

12650,"European Union's energy roadmap up to year 2050 states that in order to have an efficient and sustainable economy, with minimum or decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, along with use of renewable resources, each constituent state has the option for nuclear energy production as one desirable option. Every scenario considered for tackling climate change issues, along with security of supply positions the nuclear energy as a recommended option, an option that is highly competitive with respect to others. Nuclear energy, along with other renewable power sources are considered to be the main pillars in the energy sector for greenhouse gas emission mitigation at European level. European Union considers that nuclear energy must be treated as a highly recommended option since it can contribute to security of energy supply. Romania showed excellent track-records in operating in a safe and economically sound manner of Cernavoda NPP Units 1&2. Both Units are in top 10 worldwide in terms of capacity factor. Due to Romania's need to ensure the security of electricity supply, to meet the environmental targets and to move to low carbon generation technologies, Cernavoda Units 3&4 Project appears as a must. This Project was started in 2010 and it is expected to have the Units running by 2025. Cost effective and safety operation of a Nuclear Power Plant is made taking into consideration functional limits of its equipment. As common practice, every nuclear reactor type (technology used) is tested according to the worse credible accident or equipment failure that can occur. For CANDU type reactor, this is a Loss of Cooling Accident (LOCA). In a LOCA type accident in a CANDU NPP, using RELAP/SCDAP code for fuel bundle damage assessment the radioactive nuclei are to be quantified. Recently, CANDU type NPP accidents are studied using the RELAP/SCDAP code only. The code formerly developed for PWR type reactors was adapted for the CANDU geometry and can assess the accident progression consequences up to a certain point. The code assesses the fuel bundle damage progression, but cannot assess further core damage for a CANDU type core, and starting from these data the amount of damaged fuel can be calculated. The radio nuclei present in the damaged fuel are supposed to be released into the main heat transport system and after that into the containment building in the worst case scenario. Assessing the radioactive nuclei maximum release is the purpose of the present paper. The radioactive nuclei release is needed for the accident management plan, limiting the environmental and population impact of the supposed accident, and furthermore for a later site remediation plan that can be put in action after the complete mitigation of the accident consequences. The maximum quantity of radio nuclei released during the accident calculated in this paper is a worst case scenario evaluation that can lead to better preparedness in an accident scenario.",Beyond designed functional margins in CANDU type NPP.

12653,"To predict the hazard-induced risks of buildings and infrastructures and assess the losses caused by hazards, the fragility curve method is a common quantitative risk assessment procedure for civil structures. It has been popularly used for decades for different hazards including earthquakes, hazardous winds, tsunamis, and fires. However, there are limited reports regarding blast risk assessment of buildings using the fragility curve method. This study developed empirical blast fragility curves for wood residential buildings using the real 2013 West fertilizer plant explosion data. The development processes included five key steps: (1) selecting and calculating the blast hazard intensity measure and the air-blast incident overpressure; (2) selecting the damage states rating systems and classifying the damage state of each damaged building; (3) determining the frequency distribution of damaged buildings for each damage state; (4) proving the cumulative lognormal distribution function to describe the fragility relationship between the blast damage states and the blast hazard intensity measure; and (5) constructing the empirical fragility curves by fitting the building damage information to the selected fragility relationship distribution function. The resulted blast fragility curves of this study can be used by government officials to predict blast-induced damages of residential buildings, to plan the optimal locations and operational capacities of emergency facilities, to estimate total economic losses due to potential explosions, and to plan the social, physical and economic resilience of communities. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Blast Risk Assessment of Wood Residential Buildings: West Fertilizer Plant Explosion Case,2020,None,Classification (of information)  Curve fitting  Distribution functions  Fertilizers  Hazards  Housing  Losses  Blast-induced damages  Development process  Frequency distributions  Government officials  Log-normal distribution  Operational capacity  Quantitative risk assessment  Residential building  Risk assessment,0,1
12655,"The development of earthquake early warning systems over the last decade has seen a number of studies that have focused either on improving the real-time estimation of seismological parameters, or on the rapid characterization of the possible damage suffered by a structure. However, the rapid increase in real-time seismic networks with stations installed in both the free field and inside buildings now offers the opportunity to combine the experience gained from these activities to develop a comprehensive real-time damage assessment scheme that, depending upon the time frame and spatial scale of interest, can provide useful information for a risk-based early warning system or for rapid loss assessment. Furthermore, newly developed instruments, with their enhanced computing capabilities, also offer the chance to combine early-warning procedures with the monitoring (during seismic crises) of a structure’s behavior.

This paper presents a semi-automated feature-based approach to the identification of building conditions especially in affected areas using geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing information. For image analysis, a new detected part of contour (DPC) feature is developed for the assessment of building integrity. The DPC calculates a part of the building contour that can be detected in the remotely sensed image. Additional texture features provide information about the area inside the buildings. The effectiveness of the proposed method is proved by high overall classification accuracy for two different study cases. The results demonstrate that the map-to-image strategy enables extracting valuable information from the remotely sensed image for each individual vector object, thereby being a better choice for change detection within urban areas.",Building Change Detection Using High Resolution Remotely Sensed Data and GIS,2016,Change detection  data mining  generation of features  geographic information systems (GIS)  GIS geographic resources analysis support system (GRASS)  open source software  remote sensing,2010 HAITI EARTHQUAKE  DAMAGE ASSESSMENT  CLASSIFICATION  SATELLITE  IMAGE,0,1

The manual assessment method requires experts in structural engineering who have enough knowledge and experience in building damage assessment. To facilitate and overcome these problems, a crack classification system is developed by using a digital image processing approach (pattern recognition) that can classify cracks into the mild, moderate, or severe categories using GLCM features and SVM classifier. Based on the experimental results that the proposed method has appropriately worked for classification of two crack classes (mild and severe) indicated by 94.44% of accuracy, 88.89% of precision, and 100.00% of recall. While for three crack classes (mild, moderate, and severe) obtained the accuracy 81,48%, recall 81,41% and precision 88,09%.

12660,"After a destructive earthquake, most of the casualties are brought about by building collapse. Our work is focused on using a single postevent PolSAR (full-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar) imagery to extract the building damage information for effective emergency decision-making. PolSAR data is subject to sunlight and contains richer backscatter information. The undamaged buildings whose orientation is not parallel to the SAR flight pass and the collapsed buildings share similar dominated scattering mechanisms, i.e., volume scattering, so they are easily confused. However, the two kinds of buildings have different textures. For a more accurate classification of damaged buildings and undamaged buildings, the OPCE (optimization of polarimetric contrast enhancement) algorithm is employed to enhance the contrast ratio of the textures for the two kinds of buildings and the precision-weighted multifeature fusion (PWMF) method is proposed to merge the multiple texture features. The experiment results show that the accuracy of the proposed novel method is improved by 8.34% compared to the traditional method. In general, the proposed PWMF method can effectively merge the multiple features and the overestimation of the building collapse rate can be reduced using the proposed method in this study.",Building Damage Assessment Based on the Fusion of Multiple Texture Features Using a Single Post-Earthquake PolSAR Image,2019,Earthquake  buildings  damage assessment  texture features  feature fusion  PolSAR  collapsed buildings,SCATTERING MODEL  MARCH 11  SAR  EARTHQUAKE  DISASTER,0,1
12662,"Damage assessment from very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery plays a fundamental role in the delineation of the impact caused by catastrophic events. To date internationally accepted standard guidelines on how to assess damages to building using vertical imagery have not yet been developed. This study therefore proposes a building damage scale–and related interpretation guidelines to be operationally adopted as a standard by the main stakeholders–tailored to analyses based on VHR remote sensed vertical imagery. Preliminarily, some of the damage scales used for building damage assessment by the main satellite-based emergency mapping services have been analysed and discussed. A quantitative thematic accuracy analysis based on the open accessible crisis datasets related to the earthquake occurred in Central Italy in August 2016 has been carried out. The results highlight that by using VHR remotely sensed images it is not possible to directly apply damage classification scales addressing slight structural damages (e.g. the lowest grades proposed by EMS-’98). The paper demonstrates that using different damage classes and detailing the interpretation guidelines with operational examples is essential to increase the thematic accuracy of the analysis. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

12663,"Damage to individual buildings in an urban area of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, from the 2010 Haiti earthquake was assessed by means of high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity images and ancillary building footprints. A comparison of pre- and post-event images and a building damage inventory showed that backscattering intensity between images was more significantly changed in collapsed buildings than in less damaged buildings. The linear discriminant function, based on the difference and correlation coefficient of the images was developed to detect collapsed buildings. The result showed that almost 75% of the buildings were correctly detected by discriminant analysis. An accuracy assessment revealed the difficulty of detecting small and congested buildings because the number of image pixels was too small and the buildings were obscured by neighboring buildings and other features in the images. © 2016, Earthquake Engineering Research Institute.",Building damage assessment using high-resolution satellite SAR images of the 2010 Haiti earthquake,2016,None,Damage detection  Discriminant analysis  Earthquakes  Radar imaging  Synthetic aperture radar  Accuracy assessment  Backscattering intensity  Collapsed buildings  Correlation coefficient  High resolution satellites  High resolution synthetic aperture radar  Linear discriminant functions  Neighboring building  Buildings  accuracy assessment  building  comparative study  correlation  damage mechanics  discriminant analysis  Haiti earthquake 2010  image analysis  image resolution  synthetic aperture radar  Haiti  Hispaniola  Port au Prince,0,1
12664,"When carrying out change detection for building damage assessment using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity images, it is desirable that the observation conditions of the images are similar and acquisition time is close to the earthquake occurrence time. In this way, the influence of the radar operating system and ground temporal changes can be minimized, facilitating high-accuracy assessment results. However, in practice, especially in poor developing areas, it is difficult to obtain ideal images owing to limited pre-event data archives. In the 2015 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake, the TerraSAR-X satellite captured the influenced Sankhu area before and after the earthquake on May 30, 2010 and May 13, 2015, respectively. The pre-event data was obtained in an ascending path with an incidence angle of 41◦, whereas the post-event data was obtained in a descending path with an incidence angle of 33◦. To apply the obtained data that had different observation conditions and longtime intervals for building damage assessment, two ways were considered and studied. On one hand, the feasibility of change detection considering these factors was investigated. Pixel statistic characteristics were analyzed in twelve test areas to check the influence of temporal changes, and building footprints were buffered considering two different incidence angles. On the other hand, the reliability of classification based on only post-event data was studied. The results showed good classification performance of some texture parameters, such as the “range value” and “standard de-viation,” which are worthy of further study. Moreover, the classification results obtained using the post-event data achieved similar accuracy to that using both the pre-and post-event data, preliminarily indicating the research value of post-event data-based building damage detection as it can solve the pre-event data limitation problem once and for all. © 2019, Fuji Technology Press.

Damage from this earthquake was assessed quantitatively by means of multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) coherence and SAR intensity methods using dual-polarized SAR data obtained from the Sentinel-1 (VV, VH) and ALOS-2 (HH, HV) satellites. We developed linear discriminant functions based on three items: (1) the differential coherence values; (2) the differential backscattering intensity values of pre- and post-event images; and (3) a binary damage map of the optical pre- and post-event imagery. The accuracy of the proposed model was 84% for the Sentinel-1 data and 76% for the ALOS-2 data. The damage proxy maps deduced from the linear discriminant functions can be useful in the parcel-by-parcel assessment of building damage and development of spatial models for the allocation of urban search and rescue operations. © 2017 by the authors.","Building damage assessment using multisensor dual-polarized synthetic aperture radar data for the 2016 M 6.2 Amatrice earthquake, Italy",2017,Amatrice earthquake  Building damage  Dual-polarization  Multitemporal analysis  Synthetic aperture radar,Damage detection  Earthquakes  Geophysics  Radar  Radar imaging  Backscattering intensity  Building damage  Dual-polarizations  Intensity methods  Linear discriminant functions  Multi-temporal analysis  Seismically active region  Urban search and rescue operations  Synthetic aperture radar,0,1
12667,"Using aerial cameras, satellite remote sensing or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) equipped with cameras can facilitate search and rescue tasks after disasters. The traditional manual interpretation of huge aerial images is inefficient and could be replaced by machine learning-based methods combined with image processing techniques. Given the development of machine learning, researchers find that convolutional neural networks can effectively extract features from images. Some target detection methods based on deep learning, such as the single-shot multibox detector (SSD) algorithm, can achieve better results than traditional methods. However, the impressive performance of machine learning-based methods results from the numerous labeled samples. Given the complexity of post-disaster scenarios, obtaining many samples in the aftermath of disasters is difficult. To address this issue, a damaged building assessment method using SSD with pretraining and data augmentation is proposed in the current study and highlights the following aspects. (1) Objects can be detected and classified into undamaged buildings, damaged buildings, and ruins. (2) A convolution auto-encoder (CAE) that consists of VGG16 is constructed and trained using unlabeled post-disaster images. As a transfer learning strategy, the weights of the SSD model are initialized using the weights of the CAE counterpart. (3) Data augmentation strategies, such as image mirroring, rotation, Gaussian blur, and Gaussian noise processing, are utilized to augment the training data set. As a case study, aerial images of Hurricane Sandy in 2012 were maximized to validate the proposed method's effectiveness. Experiments show that the pretraining strategy can improve of 10% in terms of overall accuracy compared with the SSD trained from scratch. These experiments also demonstrate that using data augmentation strategies can improve mAP and mF1 by 72% and 20%, respectively. Finally, the experiment is further verified by another dataset of Hurricane Irma, and it is concluded that the paper method is feasible. © 2019 by the authors.",Building damage detection from post-event aerial imagery using single shot multibox detector,2019,Building damage assessment  Convolutional autoencoder  Deep learning  Post-event  SSD,None,0,1

12670,"Building damage assessment is of great significance to disaster monitoring. Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can record the polarization scattering measurement matrix of ground objects and obtain more abundant ground object information, meaning that they can be used for assessing damage to buildings. In this paper, a new approach is proposed to assess building damage using the Touzi incoherent decomposition and SAR-based characteristics of buildings before and after damage. The March 11th, 2011 earthquake that struck the coast of northeast Japan serves as the demonstration of the technique using quad-polarimetric ALOS PALSAR data acquired before and after the disaster. The analysis shows that after the buildings are damaged, there is a clear decrease in the alpha(s1) (the dominant scattering-type magnitude) components and the degree of this reduction corresponds to the degree of building damage. This means that the alpha(s1) components obtained by Touzi decomposition can effectively reflect the degree of building damage. On this basis, a model based on Touzi decomposition was established to evaluate the degree of damage to buildings, and the accuracy of the model was validated using high-resolution optical data acquired before and after the earthquake. The experimental results show that Touzi decomposition can be effectively used for damage assessment mapping in built-up areas.",Building damage mapping based on Touzi decomposition using quad-polarimetric ALOS PALSAR data,2020,Touzi decomposition  quad-polarization  SAR  buildings  damage  disaster management,SAR IMAGES  EXTRACTION,0,1
12671,"After an earthquake, rapidly and accurately obtaining building damage information can help to effectively guide the implementation of the emergency rescue and can reduce disaster losses and casualties. Using a single post-earthquake fully-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image to interpret building damage information not only involves a guaranteed data source but is also easy and can be rapidly implemented. This paper is focused on rapid building earthquake damage detection in urban areas using post-earthquake PolSAR data. In PolSAR images, the undamaged buildings parallel to satellite flight pass are different from the collapsed buildings, but the undamaged buildings divergent to satellite flight pass are very similar to collapsed buildings because of their volume scattering characteristics. In this paper, the method of polarization orientation angle (POA) compensation is employed to increase the scattering power of buildings divergent to satellite flight pass, and then Wishart supervised classification is implemented on the PolSAR data after POA compensation. In addition, the two parameters of normalized difference of the dihedral component (NDDC) and rho(HHHV) are proposed to improve the classification accuracy of the Wishart supervised classification, and both the undamaged buildings and collapsed buildings are determined. The study was carried out after the 4.14 Yushu earthquake in Yushu County, Qinghai province, China.

12676,"In this work, the directionality effects during the M-W 7.8 earthquake, which occurred in Muisne (Ecuador) on 16 April 2016, were analyzed under two perspectives. The first one deals with the influence of these effects on seismic intensity measures (IMs), while the second refers to the assessment of the expected damage of a specific building located in Manta city, Ecuador, as a function of its azimuthal orientation. The records of strong motion in 21 accelerometric stations were used to analyze directionality in seismic actions. At the closest station to the epicenter (R-Rup = 20 km), the peak ground acceleration was 1380 cm/s(2) (EW component of the APED station). A detailed study of the response spectra ratifies the importance of directionality and confirms the need to consider these effects in seismic hazard studies. Differences between IMs values that consider the directionality and those obtained from the as-recorded accelerograms are significant and they agree with studies carried out in other regions. Concerning the variation of the expected damage with respect to the building orientation, a reinforced concrete building, which was seriously affected by the earthquake, was taken as a case study. For this analysis, the accelerograms recorded at a nearby station and detailed structural documentation were used. The ETABS software was used for the structural analysis. Modal and pushover analyses were performed, obtaining capacity curves and capacity spectra in the two main axes of the building. Two advanced methods for damage assessment were used to obtain fragility and mean damage state curves. The performance points were obtained through the linear equivalent approximation. This allows estimation and analysis of the expected mean damage state and the probability of complete damage as functions of the building orientation. Results show that the actual probability of complete damage is close to 60%. This fact is mainly due to the greater severity of the seismic action in one of the two main axes of the building. The results are in accordance with the damage produced by the earthquake in the building and confirm the need to consider the directionality effects in damage and seismic risk assessments.",Case Study of a Heavily Damaged Building during the 2016 M-W 7.8 Ecuador Earthquake: Directionality Effects in Seismic Actions and Damage Assessment,2021,damage assessment  directionality effects  intensity measures  parametric model  2016 Ecuador earthquake,None,0,1

The numerical results indicate that the linear AEM models are as reliable as the finite element method (FEM) models to predict the modal response of the case study temple. In addition, the AEM models can potentially be further developed to estimate the damage from future earthquakes through nonlinear analyses. The present study not only informs the present health status of the masonry temple, but it also estimates how acceleration at the base of the temple is propagated through the height of the temple through comparison of floor response spectra, which could provide valuable insights into the force distribution over the height of the temple for the design of future retrofits.",Case study: Post-earthquake model updating of a heritage pagoda masonry temple using AEM and FEM,2020,Applied Element Method (AEM)  Finite Element Method (FEM)  Lidar  Nepal Gorkha Earthquake  Pagoda temples  Post-earthquake damage assessment,APPLIED ELEMENT METHOD  2015 GORKHA  DAMAGE ASSESSMENT  DYNAMIC IDENTIFICATION  KATHMANDU VALLEY  SEISMIC ANALYSIS  NEPAL  BUILDINGS  EARTHQUAKE  PERFORMANCE,0,1

12683,"Steel Plate Shear Walls (SPSWs) have proven to be efficient passive energy dissipating systems. Unstiffened SPSWs dissipate energy through tension yielding of web plates and formation of plastic hinges at the ends of horizontal boundary elements. In case of mid- and high-rise buildings, the traditional configuration of SPSW leads to column dimensions larger than the standard sections available commercially. A staggered arrangement of web plates reduces the axial demand in the columns of a staggered-SPSW, which reduces the column sizes. In comparison to a traditional SPSW, staggered-SPSW show reduced interstory drift and a more uniform drift distribution along the height, when subjected to a design based earthquake event. Also, staggered-SPSWs are less prone to a soft- or weak-story mechanism, resulting in better seismic performance. This study performs static and dynamic analyses to evaluate the performance of staggered SPSW during strong earthquake events. 6- and 9-story SPSWs with staggered and conventional configurations are developed in OpenSees. Plate-tearing and flexural hinge strength deterioration are incorporated through strain softening of the material. The modelling technique is validated against published experimental test results. 22-pairs of ground motions, recommended by FEMA P695, are scaled to perform incremental dynamic analysis. The interstory drift response, at design-based-earthquake level, and the fragility curve show that staggered SPSW perform better than their conventional counterpart. For the 6-story conventional SPSW, early failure is observed at the top story, which is not the case when staggered arrangement is adopted. The response of 9-story staggered SPSW is marginally better than the conventional SPSW. © 11th National Conference on Earthquake Engineering 2018.

Additionally, influences of different response reduction factors (R) and collapse criterion during design and analysis are also examined. For this respect, an example four-story self-centering precast wall building was designed and simulated using the numerical model verified according to reported test data. A total of eight different designs are considered for the example building with varying parameters of PT and ED designs, and R values. The analytical models are then subjected to a suite of 44 ground motions with each scaled up until the collapse occurs. The fragility curves are generated using the incremental dynamic analysis data, and the results are then used for collapse risk assessment in accordance with FEMA P695 procedure. The evaluation results show that ED designs have more influence than PT designs to the overall collapse fragility of self-centering precast walls. Nevertheless, all the prototype walls in this study are proved to have acceptably low probabilities of collapse, which is required by the design code.",Collapse fragility analysis of self-centering precast concrete walls with different post-tensioning and energy dissipation designs,2019,Self-centering precast wall  Seismic fragility  Incremental dynamic analysis  Collapse risk,SEISMIC PERFORMANCE  BEHAVIOR,0,1
18773,"Steel frames equipped with buckling restrained braces (BRBs) have been increasingly applied in earthquake-prone areas given their excellent capacity for resisting lateral forces. Therefore, special attention has been paid to the seismic risk assessment (SRA) of such structures, e.g., seismic fragility analysis. Conventional approaches, e.g., nonlinear finite element simulation (NFES), are computationally inefficient for SRA analysis particularly for large-scale steel BRB frame structures. In this study, a machine learning (ML)based seismic fragility analysis framework is established to effectively assess the risk to structures under seismic loading conditions. An optimal artificial neural network model can be trained using calculated damage and intensity measures, a technique which will be used to compute the fragility curves of a steel BRB frame instead of employing NFES. Numerical results show that a highly efficient instantaneous failure probability assessment can be made with the proposed framework for realistic large-scale building structures.

20590,"Bayesian linear regression (BLR) based demand prediction models are proposed for efficient seismic fragility analysis (SFA) of structures utilizing limited numbers of nonlinear time history analyses results. In doing so, two different BLR models i.e. one based on the classical Bayesian least squares regression and another based on the sparse Bayesian learning using Relevance Vector Machine are explored. The proposed models integrate both the record-to-record variation of seismic motions and uncertainties due to structural model parameters. The magnitude of uncertainty involved in the fragility estimate is represented by providing a confidence bound of the fragility curve. The effectiveness of the proposed BLR models are compared with the commonly used cloud method and the maximum likelihood estimates methods of SFA by considering a nonlinear single-degree-of-freedom system and a five-storey reinforced concrete building frame. It is observed that both the BLR models can estimate fragility with improved accuracy compared to those common analytical SFA approaches considering direct Monte Carlo simulation based fragility results as the benchmark.

17996,"Performance-based seismic design is the modern approach to earthquake resistant design for buildings. Many parameters involved in seismic design have uncertainty associated with them. Characterizing the probabilistic nature of these parameters can be done through the use of â€˜Fragility Curvesâ€™. A fragility analysis assesses the probability that the seismic demand placed on the structure exceeds the capacity conditioned on a chosen IM representative of the seismic loading. Demand (D) and capacity (C) are assumed to follow a lognormal distribution, and the probability of exceeding a specific damage state for a particular component can be estimated with the standard normal cumulative distribution function as per Cornell et. al. (2002). There is a different approach for fragility analysis using by ANN (Artificial Neural Network Methodology). A two-dimensional building model is analyzed for a set of 30 ground motions, and in each case the peak demand measures (e.g., inter-storey drift etc.) are recorded. Thirty spectrum consistent (IS 1893:2002) time-history data are selected and used for the analyses. A four storeyed (G+3) RC frame designed as per relevant Indian standard is chosen for this study.

20577,"An improved seismic fragility analysis method without any assumption on the distribution of the target engineering demand parameter is proposed based on an ensemble neural network. Firstly, a multidimensional performance limit state function is introduced to evaluate both the structural and non-structural performance. Next, an ensemble neural network, which is defined as a weighted average of three artificial neural networks, is trained to predict the index of the structure subjected to any seismic ground motion. A new index derived from the multidimensional performance limit state function is defined as the neural network output. Finally, the fragility curves are obtained by means of Monte Carlo simulation with high computational efficiency with the help of the ensemble neural network. It is applied to a reinforced concrete frame-shear wall structure, and the maximum inter-story drift ratio and the peak floor acceleration are selected as two engineering demand parameters. The results indicate that, the prediction accuracy of the ensemble neural network is higher than other three neural networks. If only a single neural network is used, the obtained fragility curves may have much error.

The vulnerability model rests on a data-driven approach, taking advantage of observed seismic damages detected on several Italian building typologies, struck by the 2009 Lâ€™Aquila earthquake. Unsupervised machine learning techniques are exploited for clustering empirical damage data and objectively identifying vulnerability classes of decreasing vulnerability. The cascading use of different strategies, involving clustering analysis and probability theory, results in a comprehensive vulnerability model, which allows for determining, into a probabilistic framework, the degree of belonging of a given building typology to multiple vulnerability classes. The adoption of the peak ground acceleration for characterising the ground shaking is a further advantage of this study, overcoming several limitations related to the use of macroseismic intensity.

18083,"Since 2008, an increase in human-induced seismic activity related to natural gas production and petroleum activities has resulted in millions of dollars of damage in the Central United States, primarily to residential buildings including chimneys and masonry veneers. This study aims to better understand and evaluate the impacts of such seismic hazards on masonry veneers. To do so, a probabilistic framework is proposed in which fragility curves representing the probability of cracking and collapse damage states for masonry veneers are developed. In the proposed framework, Artificial Neural Networks are adopted to develop probabilistic seismic demand models from experimentally-validated finite element analyses of non-seismically detailed masonry veneers. The framework utilizes a suite of 200 ground motions largely believed to be from human-induced earthquakes with magnitudes of 3.6â€“5.8 recorded in the Central U.S. since 2008. Fragility curves are produced for masonry veneers with code compliant corrugated brick ties and those with thinner brick ties that are commonly employed in residential construction in the Central U.S. Additionally, the proposed fragilities developed for human-induced earthquakes are compared to those from the literature, which were developed for the New Madrid seismic hazard and are commonly used for seismic vulnerability assessments of infrastructure in the Central U.S. The results indicate that for a given PGA level, induced earthquakes may be more likely to produce damage compared to earthquakes representing the New Madrid hazard. Finally, the regional extents of damage from a recent induced seismic event are estimated using the newly developed and existing fragility functions to evaluate the implications of using these models for regional vulnerability assessments.

17842,"Nowadays, more emphasis is given to flood risk management for dealing with flood disasters. To assess flood risk, damage from a flood is a crucial component to be considered. Flood damage function is a commonly accepted approach for the estimation of flood damages worldwide, where it combines the element of hazard, vulnerability, and exposure. However, this method usually considers only the flood depth and the type of buildings at risk. The effect of other flooding conditions (impact parameters) and the resistance parameters to the degree of flood damages are normally neglected. Flood risk assessment should cover all damage dimensions to obtain an extensive description of flood damages. Multivariate damage modeling can be applied to examine the relationship between flood damages and other flood influencing factors. This paper presents a review of methods applied to generate multivariate flood damage models, which includes the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Bayesian Network (BN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and the Random Forest (RF) analysis. Moreover, the multivariate models are also found capable of generating synthetic data to counter the problems of flood damage data scarcity experienced by developing countries. Identifying damage influencing factors, especially resistance parameters is important as a comprehensive flood damage model based on the local conditions and property characteristics of the study area can assist in the future damage assessment works, as well as offer decision-makers with an indispensable tool for managing strategies related to flood risk.

20601,"The fragility curve is defined as the conditional probability of failure of a structure, or its critical components, at given values of seismic intensity measures (IMs). The conditional probability of failure is usually computed adopting a log-normal assumption to reduce the computational cost. In this paper, an artificial neural network (ANN) is constructed to improve the computational efficiency for the calculation of structural outputs. The following aspects are addressed in this paper: (a) Implementation of an efficient algorithm to select IMs as inputs of the ANN. The most relevant IMs are selected with a forward selection approach based on semi-partial correlation coefficients; (b) quantification and investigation of the ANN prediction uncertainty computed with the delta method. It consists of an aleatory component from the simplification of the seismic inputs and an epistemic model uncertainty from the limited size of the training data. The aleatory component is integrated in the computation of fragility curves, whereas the epistemic component provides the confidence intervals; (c) computation of fragility curves with Monte Carlo method and verification of the validity of the log-normal assumption.

Models based on fragility curves are widely used for assessing wind damage risk at the county and census tract levels. Large-scale evaluation of the predictive accuracy of these models has been hampered by the lack of detailed damage data. This paper has three aims: (1) to evaluate the predictive accuracy of fragility-curve-based models at the census tract level using a comprehensive damage data set for Harris County residences collected after Hurricane Ike in 2008, (2) to demonstrate the need for geographically refined models of wind damage risk at spatial scales of 1-km(2) blocks and to analyze the performance of fragility-curve models at that level, and (3) to explore the sources of errors made by fragility-curve-based models at the census tract and 1-km(2)-block level using a statistical machine learning model constructed from 21 potential explanatory variables.

Starting from investigations carried out on buildings located in the outskirts of Bologna, 928 finite element models have been developed on the basis of the most recurrent data. The input parameters representing the characteristics of the structures were systematically varied and, through modal dynamic and non-linear static analyses, the outputs representing the seismic response were recorded. The resulting dataset was used to create a function, based on ANN, that can reliably predict the seismic behaviour of a RC structure. Finally, by means of k-fold cross-validation, the instruction of the function was optimised and simultaneously verified, obtaining a coefficient of determination for the totality of the samples and the previously unseen cases of 0,94 and 0,88, respectively.

Most of the studies in the literature provide a flood damage prediction or inference model at individual building level. Some of the works that adopt a higher spatial scale such as households conduct their analysis on a few specific regions. This paper presents a household-level flood damage analysis performed on 2004â€“2009 flood data from 64 districts of Bangladesh. The study focuses both on prediction and determination of influencing factors because both of these facilitate flood damage reduction programs. A machine learning driven approach has been taken for prediction where three learning algorithms namely linear regression, random forest and artificial neural network are fitted to the data and compared. In this work, linear regression performed better than the other two because its assumptions were considered. A regression analysis showed the significance of the relationship between predictors and damage. Apart from the significant hydrologic predictors, literacy, flood awareness, house structure and disaster management knowledge were found to be influential. Preparedness was observed to be statistically insignificant unless it was combined with disaster management knowledge. A principal component analysis was further performed to cluster different variables into predictor groups and inspect their effect on flood damage.

Structural wind damage is a topic that is mostly well understood for how wind pressure translates to extreme loading on a structure, how debris can affect that loading and how specific social characteristics contribute to the overall population vulnerability. While these themes are widely accepted, they have proven difficult to model in a cohesive manner, which has led primarily to physical damage models considering wind loading only as it relates to structural capacity. We take advantage of this modelling difficulty to reflect on two different ANN models for predicting the spatial distribution of structural damage due to wind loading.

16349,"Accurate estimation of risk to structures due to hurricane wind hazards is critical for emergency planning and post-event recovery. A widely used model for assessing risks due to hurricane winds at the county or zip code level is the HAZUS-MH4 suite of programs developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Very few studies have attempted to assess the predictive accuracy of HAZUS wind risk models at levels of geographical specificity below counties and zip codes. In this paper, we present a methodology for computing HAZUS predictions of wind damage aggregated to the level of one kilometer square blocks. We use detailed damage data on over 700,000 single-family residences in Harris County collected in September 2008 after Hurricane Ike for evaluating the predictive performance of HAZUS. We show that at this level of aggregation, HAZUS has a predictive accuracy of 29.5%. This finding raises the question of how to improve the predictive accuracy of HAZUS-MH4 models at this level of spatial specificity. It is difficult to manually analyze errors made by HAZUS over a data set with 700,000+ structures, so we devise a statistical machine learning approach to distinguish structures whose damage is correctly predicted by HAZUS from those that are incorrectly predicted. We identify ten potential explanatory variables at the level of each building. These variables include number of floors, terrain, age, whether a building was remodeled, building and land value, proximity to highway, and more refined wind measurements including wind speed, wind swath and wind direction. Our machine learning classifier reveals the relative importance of these variables for improving HAZUS's predictive performance. In particular, we find that HAZUS's fragility curves for one and two floor residences in urban terrains need to be refined by incorporating building and land value, age, proximity to a major highway, as well as wind direction and wind swath. These results can be used to build the next generation of HAZUS fragility curves for accurately predicting hurricane wind damage to structures at a spatial specificity of one kilometer square blocks.

17501,"In the last few decades, the seismic performance of Non-structural components (NSCs) has been a subject of extensive research. The dynamic behavior of NSCs, can cause damage to buildings, resulting in severe financial losses, injuries, and death. The necessity of assessing the seismic demand on NSCs in seismic design cannot be overstated. Current building regulations include overly simple relationships for defining design inertia forces on non-structural acceleration-sensitive components. Building code formulations are frequently unable to forecast realistic accelerations of NSCs. Floor Response Spectra (FRS) approach determines the seismic demands on acceleration-sensitive NSCs better. In this study, elastic FRS at a floor level of a linear single-degree-of-freedom system is investigated under near-field earthquakes. Damping modification factors (DMFs) for the elastic FRS are calculated for the various damping ratios of the NSCs ranging from 0.1% to 30%, the tuning ratio (i.e., the ratio between the NSC vibration period, Ts, to the building structural period, Tp) ranging from 0.1 to 3, and the building structural period ranging from 0.5 s to 4 s with 0.5 s interval. Also, artificial neural networks (ANNs) were employed to generate an empirical expression to determine the DMFs for elastic FRS. The DMFs were observed to be highly dependent on the building structural period, damping ratio and the tuning ratio of the NSC. The proposed expression is then compared with the existing relations in the literature. The expression is further validated by comparing the predicted DMFs to those obtained from time-history analysis with different ground motion records used to build the model.",Evaluation of damping modification factors for floor response spectra via machine learning model,2022,Artificial neural network  Damping modification factor  Floor response spectra  Near-field earthquakes  Non-structural component,None,1,1

15163,"The methodology followed by the Aristotle University (AUTh) team for the vulnerability assessment of reinforced concrete (R/C) and unreinforced masonry (URM) structures is presented. The paper focuses on the derivation of vulnerability (fragility) curves in terms of peak ground acceleration (PGA), as well as spectral displacement (s d), and also includes the estimation of capacity curves, for several R/C and URM building types. The vulnerability assessment methodology is based on the hybrid approach developed at AUTh, which combines statistical data with appropriately processed (utilising repair cost models) results from nonlinear dynamic or static analyses, that permit extrapolation of statistical data to PGA's and/or spectral displacements for which no data are available. The statistical data used herein are from earthquake-damaged greek buildings. An extensive numerical study is carried out, wherein a large number of building types (representing most of the common typologies in S. Europe) are modelled and analysed. Vulnerability curves for several damage states are then derived using the aforementioned hybrid approach. These curves are subsequently used in combination with the mean spectrum of the Microzonation study of Thessaloniki as the basis for the derivation of new vulnerability curves involving spectral quantities. Pushover curves are derived for all building types, then reduced to standard capacity curves, and can easily be used together with the S d fragility curves as an alternative for developing seismic risk scenarios.

18838,"Seismic fragility curves play a critical role in risk assessment because they represent the probability of attaining different damage states given the ground motion intensity. However, in case of repeated earthquakes, the seismic vulnerability of buildings varies due to damage and this shall be properly considered for the realistic estimate of evolving seismic risk during a seismic sequence. This paper presents a methodology for the assessment of damage-dependent fragility curves for existing reinforced concrete (RC) building classes. The derivation of fragility curves is based on a hybrid method that combines observational based â€œempiricalâ€ curves and mechanical based assessment of buildingsâ€™ residual capacity (REC), that is a measure of seismic capacity, which may be reduced due to seismic damage. A mechanism based procedure to assess building REC, and its variation for increasing ductility demand, is presented. Then, in order to be able to apply such procedure to RC building classes, a simulated design procedure is implemented that allows the automatic design of elements dimensions and reinforcement, as well as the characterization of the building nonlinear model needed for mechanism based analysis. Applying a Monte Carlo simulation procedure the geometric, structural and mechanical parameters, from which the design depends on, are varied according to representative distributions and populations of building models are generated and analyzed with mechanism based approach. The procedure is implemented for buildings that are prone to first storey mechanism and is applied for existing RC building classes in Lâ€™Aquila.

16914,"Residential building stock in Iran, with its diverse types, is exposed to different earthquake events each year that necessities the implementation of disaster risk reduction measures. Conducting seismic risk assessment studies, on the other hand, is crucial as one of the main perquisites of any earthquake disaster risk reduction efforts. Seismic risk assessment is an approach that requires dependable fragility or vulnerability functions, and the more valid these models are, the more realistic the risk assessment results would be. The main objective of the current study is to provide new hybrid seismic vulnerability models for typical residential buildings in Iran. In this regard, existing peer-reviewed fragility or vulnerability models are utilized as basic models besides the damage records of recent earthquake events in Iran. The logic tree approach is used to combine the basic models, and 26 seismic vulnerability models are developed based on three main attributes of material type, construction quality, and building height. The developed models are functions of PGA and are in the form of the cumulative lognormal distribution function. Additionally, the most recent national census data (2016) are utilized to combine vulnerability models via the logic tree approach and develop quality-independent vulnerability models that can be used in circumstances when precise information about the construction quality of buildings is not available. Developed models are finally validated using the real building damage data collected from the records of recent significant earthquake events in Iran.

17417,"In seismic risk assessment, fragility (or vulnerability) curves are commonly used to express the likelihood that constructions (e.g. buildings) will sustain different degrees of loss over a range of earthquake ground motion intensities. In the paper, fragility curves for typical older residential RC buildings, realized in Italy and other southern Europe countries from the 50s to the early 70s, are derived following a hybrid approach. Fragility curves are expressed in terms of spectral acceleration. Median values for each damage state (or performance limit state) are estimated based on the results of comprehensive loss assessment analysis and the definition of a suitable loss index. Dispersions are evaluated based on the results of accurate inelastic dynamic analyses carried out for a number of archetype buildings at increasing levels of seismic intensity. A detailed discussion on the parameters that influence most the fragility curves, such as the number of storeys of the building, is provided.

18286,"This study proposes a new hybrid method that uses both of post-earthquake reconnaissance data and numerical analysis results based on a finite element (FE) model. As the uncertainty of a capacity threshold for a structural damage state needs to be estimated carefully, in the proposed method, the probabilistic distribution parameters of capacity thresholds are evaluated based on post-earthquake reconnaissance data. Subsequently, the hybrid fragility curves were derived for several damage states using the updated distribution parameters of capacity thresholds. To illustrate the detailed process of the proposed hybrid method, it was applied to piloti-type reinforce concrete (RC) buildings which were affected by the 2017 Pohang earthquake, Korea. In the example, analytical fragility curves were derived first, and then hybrid fragility curves were obtained using the distribution parameters of capacity thresholds which were updated based on actual post-earthquake reconnaissance data about the Pohang city. The results showed that the seismic fragility estimates approached to the empirical failure probability at 0.27 g PGA, corresponding to the ground motion intensity of the Pohang earthquake. To verify the proposed method, hybrid fragility curves were derived with the hypothetical reconnaissance data sets created based on assumed distribution parameters with errors of 10% and 1%. As a result, it was identified that the distribution parameters accurately converged to the assumed parameters and the case of 1% error had better convergence than that of 10% error.

21168,"This paper presents a novel hybrid-based methodology devoted to develop urban fragility curves and damage probability matrices to predict likelihood seismic damage scenarios for small and medium Italian urban centres, considering URM buildings only. The concept of urban fragility curve consists of a single curve mean-representative of the seismic fragility of an entire area accounting for the combinations of building classes and their percentage, then they differ from those typological. The methodology has been developed with reference to Rocca di Mezzo, a small Italian urban centre located in the central Apennine area, Italy. Based on CarTiS inventory, building classes have been firstly recognized and urban fragility curves, representative for damage scenarios at Ultimate Limit State, developed. To predict damage scenarios from low to high-intensity earthquakes, an approach to define multi-damage urban fragility curves and damage probability matrices has been also presented. To this aim, a damage scale suffered by building classes has been defined by converting the final outcomes of the AeDES form (used in Italy for post-earthquake surveys) in the damage levels provided by the European Macroseismic Scale (EMS98). Data coming from urban fragility curves have been compared with the actual damage scenario recorded in Rocca di Mezzo after the 2009 Lâ€™Aquilaâ€™s earthquake, in terms of both peak-ground acceleration and Mecalli-Cancani-Sieberg scale. The achieved results showed a good accordance between theoretical predictions and actual damage scenarios, coherent also with the damage scenarios occurred in other Italian historical centres hit by severe earthquakes over the years. Thus, the methodology can provide a first important indicator to support the development of emergently plans devoted to identify priority of interventions in such areas particularly vulnerable with respect to others.

22224,"The prevailing Italian and Greek methodologies for seismic risk assessment are used herein to construct loss scenarios for the building stock of a small city (Potenza, Southern Italy). The inventory of buildings of interest is obtained from a survey carried out after the 1990 earthquake that struck Potenza and its hinterland, subsequently updated in 1999. About 12,000 buildings were surveyed in Potenza, using the Italian first level survey form for damage and vulnerability evaluation. In the Italian methodology, a hybrid technique is set up to evaluate vulnerability, combining an analysis of building typologies with expert judgement. The probabilistic distribution of damage is evaluated by assigning Damage Probability Matrices (DPMs) from the literature. Besides the vulnerability classes A, B and C of the MSK-scale, the class D of the anti-seismic buildings is considered and the relevant DPM is defined. Damage and economic loss scenarios relevant to dwelling buildings are constructed for three reference earthquakes. Next, the hybrid methodology for seismic vulnerability assessment of reinforced concrete (R/C) and masonry buildings developed at the University of Thessaloniki (Greece) is applied to the same building stock. The methodology combines available statistical data of damage collected after past earthquakes with a systematic nonlinear analysis of various â€œmodel buildingsâ€, representative of several vulnerability classes. Similarities, as well as discrepancies, between the two methods are discussed in the light of the obtained results, and possible sources for the discrepancies are suggested.",Vulnerability assessment and earthquake damage scenarios of the building stock of Potenza (Southern Italy) using Italian and Greek methodologies,2006,Vulnerability  Masonry  Seismic risk  Buildings  Damage scenario  Nonlinear analysis  Assessment  Concrete,None,1,1
17502,"Reliable loss assessment (in monetary terms) for buildings struck by an earthquake is an essential factor in the development of seismic risk scenarios for a given urban area. The evaluation of the seismic risk for a certain region depends both on the seismic hazard and the vulnerability of the building stock in the area. For the evaluation of building vulnerability, a hybrid methodology was recently proposed for the estimation of vulnerability (fragility) curves and the corresponding damage probability matrices. The methodology is applied here to the municipality of Ano Liosia, in the meisoseismal area of the Athens, Greece earthquake of 7/9/1999, for both reinforced concrete (R/C) and unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings. An in-situ survey of 150 building blocks was performed, and data regarding the structural type, actual earthquake damage and corresponding repair costs were collected. The actual repair cost for the area was compared with the economic loss estimation obtained using the hybrid methodology and various estimates of the seismic action in the area considered. The analytical economic loss assessment was found to agree, to a satisfactory degree, with the actual repair costs, for certain seismic hazard scenarios.

19860,Realistic and reliable risk scenarios for master plan need a broad database to allocate empirical vulnerability and/or analytical fragility functions for the damage assessment. In any case the engineer-assigned (most probable) vulnerability or building type specific fragility function have to consider the uncertainty in building response characteristic and the particularities of the local construction practice. The comparison of available fragility functions shows the demand on vulnerability (fragility) functions which appropriately represent the behavior of the building types being representative for the target area. The distinction of the building stock into building types is emphasized as an essential step before the suitable fragility function of for the risk study can be selected.

22009,"The extensive loss of human lives and building damage sustained during past tsunamis drove development of the first tsunami risk assessment in Israel. Although past tsunamis have occurred along the eastern Mediterranean coasts, no data is available for empirical hazard and risk analysis. Thus, our assessment focused on a simulated tsunami generated by an Mw 8.2 earthquake along the eastern Cypriot Arc (about 200 km NW of Haifa) in Bat Galim, the most vulnerable neighborhood in the city of Haifa, situated along the Mediterranean coast in northern Israel. This tsunami event represents the worst-case scenario threatening Bat Galim. Exposure data were taken from the National Archives of the Survey of Israel and was verified with a field survey. Two approaches were taken to derive the most appropriate vulnerability models for the study: first, already published Damage Criteria (DC) were developed based on information from past tsunami events around the world; second, damage functions were applied using the Hazus Tsunami Model (HTM), a multi-parameter loss estimation tool built using detailed engineering knowledge. Risk was considered the product of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. Following several parametric studies and sensitivity tests, we produced loss assessment results from the two most realistic model outcomes and arrived at conclusions meaningful for tsunami preparedness in northern Israel. Most importantly, we note that the loss of life far surpasses building damage. Increasing community preparedness is the simplest and most cost-effective way to significantly reduce the risk of casualties during a tsunami. We also note that upgrading the seismic design of existing structures according to required standards in Israel will decrease vulnerability to tsunamis and expand possibilities for vertical evacuation. We discuss the accuracy and reliability of our analysis and demonstrate that a simple DC approach is useful for preliminary investigation in cases of limited data. The HTM however, requires detailed preparation and data inputs but produces more realistic loss estimates. These insights may aid others during future implementation of tsunami loss modeling in threatened coastal communities.

15146,"The use of different methods for physical flood vulnerability assessment has evolved over time, from traditional single-parameter stage-damage curves to multi-parameter approaches such as multivariate or indicator-based models. However, despite the extensive implementation of these models in flood risk assessment globally, a considerable gap remains in their applicability to data-scarce regions. Considering that these regions are mostly areas with a limited capacity to cope with disasters, there is an essential need for assessing the physical vulnerability of the built environment and contributing to an improvement of flood risk reduction. To close this gap, we propose linking approaches with reduced data requirements, such as vulnerability indicators (integrating major damage drivers) and damage grades (integrating frequently observed damage patterns). First, we present a review of current studies of physical vulnerability indicators and flood damage models comprised of stage-damage curves and the multivariate methods that have been applied to predict damage grades. Second, we propose a new conceptual framework for assessing the physical vulnerability of buildings exposed to flood hazards that has been specifically tailored for use in data-scarce regions. This framework is operationalized in three steps: (i) developing a vulnerability index, (ii) identifying regional damage grades, and (iii) linking resulting index classes with damage patterns, utilizing a synthetic what-if analysis. The new framework is a first step for enhancing flood damage prediction to support risk reduction in data-scarce regions. It addresses selected gaps in the literature by extending the application of the vulnerability index for damage grade prediction through the use of a synthetic multi-parameter approach. The framework can be adapted to different data-scarce regions and allows for integrating possible modifications to damage drivers and damage grades.",A generic physical vulnerability model for floods: review and concept for data-scarce regions,2020,None,INDICATOR-BASED APPROACH  URBAN VULNERABILITY  DAMAGE ASSESSMENT  RISK-ASSESSMENT  COASTAL CITIES  CLIMATE-CHANGE  DISASTER RISK  FLASH FLOODS  LARGE-SCALE  PTVA MODEL,1,1

18002,"A series of earthquakes hit Kumamoto Prefecture in Kyushu Island, Japan, on April 14 and 16, 2016. A large number of buildings, mostly wooden houses, were damaged. This study developed fragility curves of buildings using the damage survey data provided by the Uki City government. The damage ratios of buildings were investigated from the viewpoints of the structural material and the construction period. As the result, the damage ratio of wooden buildings was found to be larger than those of other structural materials, and the damage ratios of major, moderate+, and moderate-got smaller as the construction period became newer. Empirical fragility curves of buildings for Uki City were constructed based on the damage survey data and the estimated peak ground velocity (PGV). Compared with the result of the previous study for Mashiki Town due the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, the major damage ratios of wooden buildings for Uki City was shown in a lower level than those for Mashiki Town in the same PGV. The fragility curves for Uki City were obtained using the damage survey data in the smaller PGV range than that for Mashiki Town, thus the regression results reflected the damage trend in the small PGVs. The fragility curves for Uki City and Mashiki Town due the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake were compared with those for Nishinomiya City and Nada Ward due the 1995 Kobe earthquake.

21720,"Flood risk management generally relies on economic assessments performed by using flood loss models of different complexity, ranging from simple univariable models to more complex multivariable models. The latter account for a large number of hazard, exposure and vulnerability factors, being potentially more robust when extensive input information is available. We collected a comprehensive data set related to three recent major flood events in northern Italy (Adda 2002, Bacchiglione 2010 and Secchia 2014), including flood hazard features (depth, velocity and duration), building characteristics (size, type, quality, economic value) and reported losses. The objective of this study is to compare the performances of expert-based and empirical (both uni-and multivariable) damage models for estimating the potential economic costs of flood events to residential buildings. The performances of four literature flood damage models of different natures and complexities are compared with those of univariable, bivariable and multivariable models trained and tested by using empirical records from Italy. The uni- and bivariable models are developed by using linear, logarithmic and square root regression, whereas multivariable models are based on two machine-learning techniques: random forest and artificial neural networks. Results provide important insights about the choice of the damage modelling approach for operational disaster risk management. Our findings suggest that multivariable models have better potential for producing reliable damage estimates when extensive ancillary data for flood event characterisation are available, while univariable models can be adequate if data are scarce. The analysis also highlights that expert-based synthetic models are likely better suited for transferability to other areas compared to empirically based flood damage models.",Testing empirical and synthetic flood damage models: the case of Italy,2019,None,RISK-ASSESSMENT  INPUT-OUTPUT  TRANSFERABILITY  CLASSIFICATION  PREDICTION  REDUCTION  ENSEMBLES  NETWORKS  IMPACT  COST,1,1

17330,"This manuscript presents empirical building fragility functions that were developed based on data obtained from the 29th September 2009 South Pacific tsunami. A multi-disciplinary reconnaissance team involving topographic surveyors, tsunami/hydrology modellers, structural engineers, and risk analysts collected observational and quantitative data on building damage and the tsunami demand. A diverse range of collected data, which included a topographic survey, observed water depths, predominant flow directions, inundation limits, building damage, and eyewitness reports, were used to recreate the peak tsunami-induced demands on structures at each of the survey locations. Using the interpreted data, fragility functions were developed for a variety of building classes using logistic regression. It was observed that residential timber structures were more fragile (i.e. have a higher likelihood of damage for a given water depth) than masonry residential structures for severe and collapse damage states. Conversely, residential reinforced concrete structures were observed to be less fragile than residential masonry structures for severe and collapse damage states. The influence of â€˜shieldingâ€™ and â€˜entrained debrisâ€™ effects on fragility functions were also quantified using the empirical data. Other parameters such as velocity or impact duration were not considered due to the paucity of data.

21081,"This study focuses on empirical assessment of vulnerability and fragility curves of existing reinforced concrete (RC) buildings in Ibn Khaldoun area of Boumerdes city (Algeria). In this area, existing RC buildings experienced significant damage during the 2003 Boumerdes earthquake. Currently, the area includes existing non-damaged buildings, strengthened buildings and new RC buildings constructed in place of those demolished. The proposed seismic vulnerability assessment method combines the GNDT (Gruppo Nazionale per la Difesa dai Terremoti) II level method and the macroseismic method by means of correlation between the peak ground acceleration PGA and the macroseismic intensity I. For this purpose, data was collected by investigating buildings within the area. Structural and non-structural building characteristics were identified and statistical analysis was performed. Resulting vulnerability curves obtained using the macroseismic method were expressed as a function of macroseismic intensity and the vulnerability index obtained using the GNDT II level method.

17340,"In 2012, the Emilia-Romagna region in Italy was affected by ground shaking as well as widespread ground failure (mostly liquefaction) caused by a sequence of earthquakes. The fragility of the residential building inventory is empirically assessed here based on information from 39,087 buildings in 64 municipalities surveyed in order to assess their post-disaster usability. Key (and common) challenge with this type of large post-disaster databases is how best to treat the notable missing data error and address the non-representative sample. Fragility curves for buildings based on their construction material or age are constructed for areas affected by ground shaking and for areas ones affected by ground failure. As expected, old masonry buildings are the most vulnerable and reinforced concrete buildings are seen to be the least vulnerable. Both peak ground acceleration and peak ground velocity have been used to express the intensity measure type. Although, the former was found to fit the data best, it poorly predicted the probability of exceedance of extreme damage to ground failure for building classes associated with small sample sizes (e.g. RC buildings), highlighting the limitations of using non-representative samples in fragility assessment for extreme cases.

21025,"A previous study by the authors provides an overview of existing seismic risk assessment approaches and available seismic fragility information and highlights the lack of relevant information for nonengineered residential buildings. The current paper proposes a procedure for developing empirical seismic fragility curves for nonengineered residential buildings using the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) seismic ground motion and shaking intensity maps presented in a geographic information system (GIS) format, to overcome the lack of ground motion recordings. The proposed procedure has been applied to a damage data set collected in Bantul Regency, Indonesia, in the aftermath of the May 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake. Fragility curves for nonengineered single-story unreinforced masonry (URM) residential buildings have been derived using the damage data set for the peak ground acceleration (PGA) and pseudospectral acceleration (PSA) as the ground motion intensity measures. The developed fragility curves indicate the high seismic vulnerability of nonengineered residential buildings. This study also demonstrates the potential of utilizing USGS seismic ground motion data to develop empirical fragility curves for nonengineered residential buildings in developing countries. In addition, a comparison of the results from other seismic risk assessment studies highlights the significant influence of the derivation method used on the fragility curve characteristics.

15313,"This paper presents empirical fragility curves for the Italian residential reinforced concrete building stock, by taking advantage of post-earthquake damage data collected in the online platform Da.D.O., recently released by the Italian Department of Civil Protection. The peak ground acceleration from shakemap is selected to represent the ground motion severity at the building locations. Reinforced concrete buildings are classified into fifteen structural typologies, identified based on the number of stories (from 1 to 5) and the type of design (i.e. for gravity loads only, for seismic loads pre-1981 and for seismic loads post-1981). Typological fragility curves are derived for five damage states of the EMS-98, accounting for damage on both structural and non-structural building components. Two vulnerability classes, C2 and D, of decreasing vulnerability are defined, then refined based on the building class of height (i.e. low-rise, mid-rise and high-rise). Fragility curves of the predefined vulnerability classes are then obtained by averaging typological fragility functions, suitably weighted based on the composition of the existing building stock. The proposed fragility model is then implemented in the Italian National platform for large-scale seismic risk assessment. Copyright Â© 2019 COMPDYN Proceedings.

17353,"The study analyses the data related to a database of 7597 private Reinforced Concrete buildings located in the city and the province of Lâ€™Aquila surveyed after the 2009 earthquake. Survey data were collected by the Italian Department of Civil Protection during post-earthquake usability inspections including information on building characteristics, level and extent of damage to structural and non-structural components. For each building, the Peak Ground Acceleration demand has been determined according to data available from the ShakeMap of the event and the georeferenced building location. The analysis of data highlights the key role played by the damage to non-structural componentsâ€”namely, infills and partitions. Damage Grades according to the European Macroseismic Scale EMS-98 have been derived from damage data to single building components. Two building classes have been defined in the study in order to investigate the influence of number of storeys of buildings on the observed damage. Damage Probability Matrices have been derived for the assumed building classes and bins of Peak Ground Acceleration, and observed trends are analyzed. Different methodologies for estimating fragility functions from data on Damage Grades and Peak Ground Acceleration demand are illustrated, discussed and applied to the database, leading to the derivation of EMS-98-based fragility curves for the defined building classes. Finally, the proposed fragility curves are compared with main empirical fragility curves for RC buildings from literature studies.

15433,"Flood loss modeling is an important component within flood risk assessments. Traditionally, stage-damage functions are used for the estimation of direct monetary damage to buildings. Although it is known that such functions are governed by large uncertainties, they are commonly applied - even in different geographical regions - without further validation, mainly due to the lack of real damage data. Until now, little research has been done to investigate the applicability and transferability of such damage models to other regions. In this study, the last severe flood event in the Austrian Lech Valley in 2005 was simulated to test the performance of various damage functions from different geographical regions in Central Europe for the residential sector. In addition to common stage-damage curves, new functions were derived from empirical flood loss data collected in the aftermath of recent flood events in neighboring Germany. Furthermore, a multi-parameter flood loss model for the residential sector was adapted to the study area and also evaluated with official damage data. The analysis reveals that flood loss functions derived from related and more similar regions perform considerably better than those from more heterogeneous data sets of different regions and flood events. While former loss functions estimate the observed damage well, the latter overestimate the reported loss clearly. To illustrate the effect of model choice on the resulting uncertainty of damage estimates, the current flood risk for residential areas was calculated. In the case of extreme events like the 300 yr flood, for example, the range of losses to residential buildings between the highest and the lowest estimates amounts to a factor of 18, in contrast to properly validated models with a factor of 2.3. Even if the risk analysis is only performed for residential areas, our results reveal evidently that a carefree model transfer in other geographical regions might be critical. Therefore, we conclude that loss models should at least be selected or derived from related regions with similar flood and building characteristics, as far as no model validation is possible. To further increase the general reliability of flood loss assessment in the future, more loss data and more comprehensive loss data for model development and validation are needed.

17345,"In this paper, empirical fragility curves for reinforced concrete buildings are derived, based on post-earthquake damage data collected in the aftermath of earthquakes occurred in Italy in the period 1976â€“2012. These data, made available through an online platform called Da.D.O., provide information on building position, building characteristics and damage detected on different structural components. A critical review of this huge amount of data is carried out to guarantee the consistency among all the considered databases. Then, an in-depth analysis of the degree of completeness of the survey campaign is made, aiming at the identification of the Municipalities subjected to a partial survey campaign, which are discarded from fragility analysis. At the end of this stage, only the Irpinia 1980 and Lâ€™Aquila 2009 databases are considered for further elaborations, as fully complying with these criteria. The resulting database is then integrated with non-inspected buildings sited in less affected areas (assumed undamaged), to account for the negative evidence of damage. The PGA evaluated from the shakemaps of the Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) and a metric based on six damage levels according to EMS-98 are used for fragility analysis. The damage levels are obtained from observed damage collected during post-earthquake inspections through existing conversion rules, considering damage to vertical structures and infills/partitions. The maximum damage level observed on vertical structures and infills/partitions is then associated to the whole building. Fragility curves for two vulnerability classes, C2 and D, further subdivided into three classes of building height, are obtained from those derived for specific structural typologies (identified based on building height and type of design), using their frequency of occurrence at national level as weights.

21210,"Australia has a low to moderate seismicity by world standards. However, the seismic risk is significant due to the legacy of older buildings constructed prior to the national implementation of an earthquake building standard in Australia. The 1989 Newcastle and the 2010 Kalgoorlie earthquakes are the most recent Australian earthquakes to cause significant damage to unreinforced masonry (URM) and light timber frame structures and have provided the best opportunities to examine the earthquake vulnerability of these building types. This paper describes the two above-mentioned building types with a differentiation of older legacy buildings constructed prior to 1945 to the relatively newer ones constructed after 1945. Furthermore, the paper presents method to utilise the large damage and loss-related data (14,000 insurance claims in Newcastle and 400 surveyed buildings in Kalgoorlie) collected from these events to develop empirical vulnerability functions. The method adopted here followed the GEM empirical vulnerability assessment guidelines which involve preparing a loss database, selecting an appropriate intensity measure, selecting and applying a suitable statistical approach to develop vulnerability functions and the identification of optimum functions. The adopted method uses a rigorous statistical approach to quantify uncertainty in vulnerability functions and provides an optimum solution based on goodness-of-fit tests. The analysis shows that the URM structures built before 1945 are the most vulnerable to earthquake with post-1945 URM structures being the next most vulnerable. Timber structures appear to be the least vulnerable, with little difference observed in the vulnerability of timber buildings built before or after 1945. Moreover, the older structures (both URM and timber) exhibit more scatter in results reflecting greater variation in building vulnerability and performance during earthquakes. The analysis also highlights the importance of collecting high-quality damage and loss data which is not only a fundamental requirement for developing empirical vulnerability functions, but is also useful in validating analytically derived vulnerability functions. The vulnerability functions developed herein are the first publically available functions for Australian URM and timber structures. They can be used for seismic risk assessment and to focus the development of retrofit strategies to reduce the existing earthquake risk.",Seismic vulnerability functions for Australian buildings by using GEM empirical vulnerability assessment guidelines,2016,Empirical vulnerability  Kalgoorlie earthquake  Newcastle earthquake  Unreinforced masonry  Timber  Beta regression  GEM empirical vulnerability assessment guidelines,CANTERBURY EARTHQUAKE SEQUENCE  1987 EDGECUMBE EARTHQUAKE  BETA REGRESSION  MASONRY BUILDINGS  FRAGILITY CURVES  DAMAGE COSTS  PERFORMANCE  INTENSITY  BIAS,1,1

21082,"This study focuses on empirical assessment of vulnerability and fragility curves of existing reinforced concrete (RC) buildings in Ibn Khaldoun area of Boumerdes city (Algeria). In this area, existing RC buildings experienced significant damage during the 2003 Boumerdes earthquake. Currently, the area includes existing non-damaged buildings, strengthened buildings and new RC buildings constructed in place of those demolished. The proposed seismic vulnerability assessment method combines the GNDT (Gruppo Nazionale per la Difesa dai Terremoti) II level method and the macroseismic method by means of correlation between the peak ground acceleration PGA and the macroseismic intensity I. For this purpose, data was collected by investigating buildings within the area. Structural and non-structural building characteristics were identified and statistical analysis was performed. Resulting vulnerability curves obtained using the macroseismic method were expressed as a function of macroseismic intensity and the vulnerability index obtained using the GNDT II level method. Fragility curves, obtained by using correlation between the peak ground acceleration PGA and the macroseismic intensity I, showed that the highest probability to reach or exceed a very heavy damage grade is obtained for the highest values of I and vulnerability index V.","Seismic Vulnerability Analysis of RC Buildings: Case Study of Ibn Khaldoun Area in Boumerdes City, Algeria",2021,Boumerdes  Damage  Vulnerability assessment  Fragility curve,INTENSITY,1,1
17355,"In this study, empirical fragility curves expressed in terms of relationship between damage ratio indices of buildings and ground motion indices were developed in northern Miyagi prefecture located in near-field areas during the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake. The ground motion indices were evaluated from observed ground motions at strong-motion stations and estimated at sites at which no strong-motion accelerometers were deployed during the mainshock. The ground motions at the non-instrumental sites were estimated using the empirical Green's function method based on bedrock motions inverted from observed records on surfaces from small events that occurred inside the source fault, transfer functions due to underground velocity structures identified from microtremor H/V spectral ratios, and a short-period source model of the mainshock. The findings indicated that the empirical fragility curves as functions of Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) instrumental seismic intensity during the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake almost corresponded to those during the 1995 Kobe Earthquake and the seven disastrous earthquakes that occurred between 2003 and 2008. However, the empirical fragility curves as functions of peak ground velocity were the lowest. A possible reason for this is that the response spectra of the ground motions in the period ranging from 1.0 s to 1.5 s were small during the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake. Another reason could be the seismic resistant capacities of buildings in the studied districts involved during the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake exceeded those in the cities affected during the 1995 Kobe Earthquake.",Empirical Fragility Curves of Buildings in Northern Miyagi Prefecture During the 2011 off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku Earthquake,2016,empirical fragility curves  the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake  microtremor H/V spectral ratio  damage ratio indices  estimated ground motions,None,1,1

A tsunami is preceded by a ground motion, both are caused by an earthquake. The coastal structures are hit, within a short period of time by both phenomena. In this study, we developed a method to build fragility curves for reinforced concrete structures subject to tsunami. The fragility curves are function of the intensity measure of the tsunami wave: wave height. The fragility curves of a prototype reinforced concrete building were computed through non-linear static analysis.

16905,"A series of earthquakes hit Kumamoto Prefecture on Kyushu Island, Japan on April 14 and 16, 2016. Soon after the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, municipal governments carried out building damage surveys to issue disaster-victim certificates. The building damage caused by the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake was serious in Mashiki Town, which is located close to the source region, but Uki City, next to that area, was also heavily damaged. The present authors have already developed several fragility curves using damage survey data from the Mashiki Town and Uki City governments. Some of the fragility curves for Mashiki Town rise sharply at low PGV levels because of the lack of damage data in the low PGV range. Compared with the fragility curves for Mashiki Town, the fragility curves for Uki City show a lower damage ratio for the same PGV. The fragility curves for Uki City were obtained using the damage data in the PGV range lower than those for Mashiki Town. In this study, we integrated the damage survey data of the Mashiki Town government and the Uki City government due to the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, and constructed building fragility curves with respect to the structural material and construction period in combination with the estimated seismic motion distribution. The correlation coefficient showed a strong positive correlation of approximately 0.9 in all classifications of the building fragility curves covering a wide range of seismic ground motions. The validity of the proposed fragility curves was demon-strated and compared with existing fragility curves developed using damage survey data from local governments in other earthquakes.

15312,"This paper describes a fragility model for the seismic risk assessment of residential masonry buildings, by taking advantage of Italian post-earthquake damage data collected in the time span 1980-2009. The proposed model includes empirically-derived fragility curves for three vulnerability classes, further subdivided based on the building height (i.e. low-rise and mid-/high-rise). To this aim, damage data are uniformly allocated to predefined building typologies, representative of the Italian built environment, and damage levels. Typological fragility curves are derived for five damage states of the EMS-98, considering the peak ground acceleration from shakemap as the selected ground motion intensity measure. The predefined masonry building typologies are then attributed to the vulnerability classes. The proposed model is then implemented in the framework of the Italian national platform for assessing seismic risk at different scale levels (e.g. regional and national scales) and an example of application is presented.

17455,"Traditional flood design methods are increasingly supplemented or replaced by risk-oriented methods which are based on comprehensive risk analyses. Besides meteorological, hydrological and hydraulic investigations such analyses require the estimation of flood impacts. Flood impact assessments mainly focus on direct economic losses using damage functions which relate property damage to damage-causing factors. Although the flood damage of a building is influenced by many factors, usually only inundation depth and building use are considered as damage-causing factors. In this paper a data set of approximately 4000 damage records is analysed. Each record represents the direct monetary damage to an inundated building. The data set covers nine flood events in Germany from 1978 to 1994. It is shown that the damage data follow a Lognormal distribution with a large variability, even when stratified according to the building use and to water depth categories. Absolute depth-damage functions which relate the total damage to the water depth are not very helpful in explaining the variability of the damage data, because damage is determined by various parameters besides the water depth. Because of this limitation it has to be expected that flood damage assessments are associated with large uncertainties. It is shown that the uncertainty of damage estimates depends on the number of flooded buildings and on the distribution of building use within the flooded area. The results are exemplified by a damage assessment for a rural area in southwest Germany, for which damage estimates and uncertainty bounds are quantified for a 100-year flood event. The estimates are compared to reported flood damages of a severe flood in 1993. Given the enormous uncertainty of flood damage estimates the refinement of flood damage data collection and modelling are major issues for further empirical and methodological improvements.
