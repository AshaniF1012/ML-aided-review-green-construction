17496,"Evaluation of Building Type Adjacent Structures' Interacted and Single Seismic Performances by Fragility Curves The performance-based analysis for the low-storey building type structures are generally carried out, as those buildings were isolated single standing buildings with no interaction with adjacent buildings. Incorporating the interaction of the adjacent buildings in seismic performance and risk (retrofitting) analysis by using proper modelling techniques seems important by means of obtaining the deviation of the results from the conventional analysis results of isolated single modelled structures. Literature review has been carried out for the following topics; adjacent building models, push-over analysis, earthquake acceleration, time series database analysis and scaled records, time history analysis of equation of motion with Newmark-beta method and fragility curves for building performance levels. The aim of this study is the evaluation of vulnerability risk via fragility curves for seismic performance of adjacent buildings as interacting structures. Results show that interacted and isolated analysis types yields different seismic performance levels.

15770,"Assessment of pluvial flood exposure and vulnerability of residential areas Floods are a large problem around the world but the understanding of flood risks is hampered by a lack of data and knowledge about flood losses at different scales. The objective of this study was two-fold 1) to assess available temporally and spatially distributed data of rain events and flood damages during those events, regarding the usefulness of these data to quantify precipitation-related hazards and consequences, and 2) to assess the potential for deriving reliable damage functions based on the information compiled under objective 1. The study examined 2140 individual observations of insurance payouts for residential buildings caused by 49 different rainfall events in Sweden. Radar data were used to extract daily precipitation amounts and to capture the spatial and temporal distribution of the rainfalls. This study demonstrates that including the duration of a rainfall, as opposed to only the aggregated amount of daily precipitation, is highly important in estimating the extent of damage. Furthermore, higher rainfall intensities increased the number of damaged properties but had less influence on the mean damage cost per property. In order to draw conclusions from damages at the micro level, both availability and detail level of data must be improved.

20395,"Seismic damage assessment for waffled-slabs reinforced concrete (RC) buildings in Barcelona The seismic damage of waffled-slabs reinforced concrete buildings in the city of Barcelona (Spain) is evaluated using Risk-UE methodology, which enables obtaining fragility curves of the structure in a simplified manner through capacity curves. The seismic hazard is described by means of the reduced 5%-damped elastic response spectrum specific to Barcelona. Capacity curves are obtained using a non-linear static analysis and are used to obtain the performance point and probability damage matrices corresponding to the specified seismic hazard. Four different buildings, representing most typical structure configuration used in the city, are studied based on detailed data from real structures. Despite low-to-moderate seismic hazard in the region, the results show that these buildings present a considerable seismic vulnerability and a relevant expected seismic damage due to its poor expected performance. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. capacity spectra  damage assessment  damage probability matrices (DPM)  fragility curves  reinforced concrete (RC)  seismic behavior  vulnerability  waffled slabs Concrete buildings  Concrete construction  Damage detection  Hazards  Matrix algebra  Seismic response  Structural analysis  Capacity spectrum  Damage assessments  Damage probability matrices  Fragility curves  Seismic behavior  vulnerability  Waffled slabs  Reinforced concrete",Seismic damage assessment for waffled-slabs reinforced concrete (RC) buildings in Barcelona,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2684770747417873,0.049181982242140675,0.11100763194433375,0.0062438369915111145,Analytical
19715,"Probabilistic depth–damage curves for assessment of flood-induced building losses The most common and internationally accepted method of assessing building damage due to flooding is through the application of a depth–damage curve (DDC). A DDC relates the percent damage or estimated economic loss to a buildings’ structural integrity and/or contents directly to a given water level (depth). The DDC generally represents an average structure within a given building category, e.g. one-storey single-family residence. Given the great variability across any given structural category, the variation in building materials, construction quality across communities and the singular focus on depth for estimation of losses, it is important to communicate the uncertainty and potential variability of the expected losses in any assessment. In this paper, probabilistic depth–damage curves (PDDCs) are developed based on synthetically derived DDCs from communities in southern Ontario. The generated PDDCs are based on assumed loss thresholds for minor and major loss levels, as spent in Canadian dollars. The economic loss estimates obtained in this way and their likelihood of being exceeded at any given flood depth express more transparently the potential building losses. An applied example of this method is included for both aggregate and building-by-building loss estimation. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

21380,"Simplilied buildings fragility functions for regional seismic risk assessment One of the challenges in regional seismic risk assessment studies is to generate a reliable inventory of the exposed buildings. To decrease the potential errors in identification of structural load carrying systems, a simplified building classification scheme is proposed with: one reinforced concrete building class Cs which regroups generic building classes indicated as C1, C2 and C3; and a steel building class Ss combining S1, S2, S4 and S5 generic building classes. Simplified fragility curves (SFC) representative for these combinations were developed by fitting lognormal curves through individual damage estimates for the generic classes. The average absolute deviations measured for each SFC were below 3.6%, which is considerably lower than errors observed in the building inventories, ~20%. Knowing that significant effort is needed to generate accurate regional inventories, this simplified method offers reasonable accurate damage estimates for reduced building classification scheme. © 11th National Conference on Earthquake Engineering 2018, NCEE 2018: Integrating Science, Engineering, and Policy.

13208,"Preliminary tsunami analytical fragility functions proposal for Italian coastal residential masonry buildings Scientific community showed particular interest in tsunami risk assessment in the last years due to several worldwide tsunami events where high damages and human casualties were recorded during post-event surveys. This paper investigates the behaviour of Italian coastal residential masonry buildings under tsunami loads. Main fragility curves available in literature are based on empirical databases and consequentially, the structural behaviour is strictly related to local building typologies of other countries. For masonry buildings, it is complex to predict global response due to high material inhomogeneity, especially in the case of regional scale analysis; a critical review on local mechanisms activation of masonry walls under tsunami loads is briefly performed. Therefore, local mechanisms activation for masonry walls are investigated depending on out-of-plane and in-plane mechanisms assuming flexural and shear failure. Structures designed for gravity or seismic loads are generated based on several building classes depending on number of storeys and age of construction. Monte Carlo analyses generated building models for each identified building class to simulate the behaviour of Italian masonry buildings. Preliminary analytical tsunami fragility curves are developed in order to assess the vulnerability of Italian coastal residential masonry buildings under tsunami loads.

Starting from three fundamental concepts, capacity curve, design point and fragility curve, this assessment is made in terms of the seismic demand and the structural capacity and response, taking into account the uncertainty originating in the material properties.

16666,"Damage models for extreme flood events - Part 1: Modeling and validation based on the 2002 flood [Schadensmodelle für extreme Hochwasser-Teil 1: Modellbildung und Validierung am Hochwasser 2002] Damage models for extreme flood events-Part 1: Modeling and validation based on the 2002 flood The actual 2013 flood events illustrate the importance of the flood protection measures planned and partly already implemented after the 2002 flood. The economic evaluation of these measures in the context of cost-benefit analysis show the demand for development of new resilient damage functions for each usage class. Conventional loss models are limited to the relationship between flood height and the comprehensible cost from the insurance side for a specific usage class (like e. g. private residential buildings). On the one hand the required differentiation according to the parameters on the resistance side is still missing and on the other hand further impact parameters like flow velocity remain unconsidered. Based on the experiences in the earthquake hazard assessment a vulnerability and engineering based flood damage model was developed in different research projects at the Earthquake Damage Analysis Center (EDAC) at the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar. The provided vulnerability functions describe the relationship between flood height, flow velocity and the damage grades Di taking into account the building vulnerability. As well newly developed damage functions transfer these parameters into concrete loss statements. Based on the extensive evaluation of damage data, the flood damage model has been improved in recent years and new vulnerability-and damage functions were implemented. The paper gives again an overview of the elements of the model and introduces the new functions. The functions are validated on the 2002 flood event taken into account improved data bases.

17463,"Evaluación sísmica de los edificios de mampostería típicos de Barcelona aplicando la metodología Risk-UE Resumen En este trabajo se realiza un estudio para evaluar la vulnerabilidad y el daño sísmico en edificios de obra de fábrica de ladrillo no reforzada. Se han elegido 3 modelos de edificios representativos del distrito Eixample de Barcelona. El análisis de la vulnerabilidad sísmica se lleva a cabo mediante la metodología Risk-UE. La demanda sísmica se define a partir del espectro de proyecto elástico con 5% de amortiguamiento, definido, en este caso, por el Eurocódigo 8. Las curvas de fragilidad se obtienen a partir de un análisis no lineal, teniendo en cuenta los espectros de capacidad. El daño sísmico esperado se consigue con las matrices de probabilidad de daño, las cuales indican la probabilidad de ocurrencia de un estado de daño para una demanda sísmica específica. La modelización de los edificios se realiza con el programa TreMuri mediante un modelo de macroelementos, el cual representa las paredes de los edificios. Los edificios aquí analizados son reales y se dispuso de planos e informes específicos. Los resultados obtenidos muestran una vulnerabilidad importante en este tipo de edificios, teniendo en cuenta el escenario sísmico considerado el daño sísmico esperado es alto. In this work, a study about the vulnerability and seismic damage of unreinforced masonry buildings is carried out. Three models of buildings representatives of the Eixample district of Barcelona have been chosen. The seismic vulnerability is evaluated by means of the Risk-UE methodology. The seismic demand is described by elastic project spectrum, in this case, defined by the Eurocode 8. Fragility curves are obtained from a nonlinear analysis, considering the capacity spectra. Expected seismic damage is gotten with the damage probability matrices, which indicate the occurrence probability of a damage state for a seismic demand given. The analysis of the buildings has been performed by TreMuri program by means of a macroelements model, which represents of a whole masonry panel. The buildings, here, analyzed are real and detailed structural drawings and reports have been used to model them. The results shown a considerable vulnerability in this type of buildings, therefore, in spite of the seismic hazard the expected seismic risk is significant.

16874,"Development of an integrated approach for Algerian building seismic damage assessment This paper presents a framework for seismic damage evaluation for Algerian buildings adapted from HAZUS approach (Hazard-United States). Capacity and fragility curves were adapted to fit the Algerian building typologies (Reinforced Concrete structures, Confined or Non-Confined Masonry, etc). For prediction purposes, it aims to estimate the damages and potential losses that may be generated by a given earthquake in a prone area or country. Its efficiency is validated by comparing the estimated and observed damages in Boumerdès city, in the aftermath of Boumerdès earthquake (Algeria: May 21st 2003; Mw = 6.8). For this purpose, observed damages reported for almost 3,700 buildings are compared to the theoretical predictions obtained under two distinct modelling of the seismic hazard. In one hand, the site response spectrum is built according to real accelerometric records obtained during the main shock. In the other hand, the effective Algerian seismic code response spectrum (RPA 99) in use by the time of the earthquake is considered; it required the prior fitting of Boumerdès site PGA (Peak Ground Acceleration) provided by Ambraseys' attenuation relationship.

Different tools regarding the determination of capacity curves of different existing structural systems by using a non-linear structural analysis are implemented and explained. Four damage states are defined for both structural systems. The earthquake action is expressed in terms of spectral values and the seismic quality of the buildings; the probabilities of the damage states are obtained considering a lognormal probability distribution.

17853,"Flood risk analyses - How detailed do we need to be? Applied flood risk analyses, especially in urban areas, very often pose the question how detailed the analysis needs to be in order to give a realistic figure of the expected risk. The methods used in research and practical applications range from very basic approaches with numerous simplifying assumptions up to very sophisticated, data and calculation time demanding applications both on the hazard and on the vulnerability part of the risk. In order to shed some light on the question of required model complexity in flood risk analyses and outputs sufficiently fulfilling the task at hand, a number of combinations of models of different complexity both on the hazard and on the vulnerability side were tested in a case study. The different models can be organized in a model matrix of different complexity levels: On the hazard side, the approaches/models selected were (A) linear interpolation of gauge water levels and intersection with a digital elevation model (DEM), (B) a mixed 1D/2D hydraulic model with simplifying assumptions (LISFLOOD-FP) and (C) a Saint-Venant 2D zero-inertia hyperbolic hydraulic model considering the built environment and infrastructure. On the vulnerability side, the models used for the estimation of direct damage to residential buildings are in order of increasing complexity: (I) meso-scale stage-damage functions applied to CORINE land cover data, (II) the rule-based meso-scale model FLEMOps+ using census data on the municipal building stock and CORINE land cover data and (III) a rule-based micro-scale model applied to a detailed building inventory. Besides the inundation depths, the latter two models consider different building types and qualities as well as the level of private precaution and contamination of the floodwater. The models were applied in a municipality in east Germany, Eilenburg. It suffered extraordinary damage during the flood of August 2002, which was well documented as were the inundation extent and depths. These data provide an almost unique data set for the validation of flood risk analyses. The analysis shows that the combination of the 1D/2D model and the meso-scale damage model FLEMOps+ performed best and provide the best compromise between data requirements, simulation effort, and an acceptable accuracy of the results. The more detailed approaches suffered from complex model set-up, high data requirements, and long computation times. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.

13373,"Seismic Fragility Curves of Industrial Buildings by Using Nonlinear Analysis This study presents the steel fragility curves and performance curves of industrial buildings of different geometries. The fragility curves were obtained for different building geometries, and the performance curves were developed based on lateral load, which is affected by the geometry of the building. Three records of far-field ground motion were used for incremental dynamic analysis (IDA), and the design lateral loads for pushover analysis (POA). All designs were based on British Standard (BS 5950); however, Eurocode 8 was preferred for seismic consideration in the analysis because BS 5950 does not specify any seismic provision. The five levels of performance stated by FEMA-273, namely, operational phase, immediate occupancy, damage control, life safety, and collapse prevention (CP) were used as main guidelines for evaluating structural performance. For POA, Model 2 had highest base shear, followed by Model 1 and Model 3, even though Model 2 has a smaller structure compared with Model 3. Meanwhile, the fragility curves showed that the probability of reaching or exceeding the CP level of Model 2 is the highest, followed by that of Models 1 and 3. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.

13315,"Seismic damage and fragility assessment of ancient masonry churches located in central Chile An assessment of damage and seismic fragility of historical unreinforced masonry churches located in Chile's central valley was carried out employing the results of a field survey of 106 ancient churches, after the 2010 Maule earthquake. The observed damage was correlated with recurrent failure mechanisms of unreinforced masonry structures, by taking into account 22 local mechanisms involving macro-elements on these churches. The average damage level suffered by each church was computed considering the global and local behaviors of the structures through a damage index computed as a weighted mean of the levels of damage observed for each mechanism. The results of this damage index method are used to obtain Probability Mass Functions and suitable probabilistic tools are used to propose Empirical Fragility Curves (EFCs) for these structures. The EFCs are directly usable by stakeholders involved in risk assessment aimed to the prioritization of possible future damage mitigation strategies and other decision making processes relative to this historical heritage.

15108,"A deep learning approach to rapid regional post-event seismic damage assessment using time-frequency distributions of ground motions Every year, earthquakes result in severe economic losses and a significant number of casualties worldwide. In limiting the losses that occur after these extreme events, timely and accurate assessment of seismic damages and mobilizing proportionate post-event relief efforts play crucial roles. Traditional on-site investigation generally results in prolonged evaluation windows. Several computational alternatives exist that show promise in addressing the downsides of the traditional approach. Damage estimates based on pre-computed fragility libraries can provide near-real time seismic damage quantification, but at present, they are coarse and involve considerable uncertainties. Estimates based on nonlinear time-history analyses simulate the seismic response in greater detail, yet due to the computation and data requirements, their use at the regional scale is challenging. Given this perspective, herein, a rapid regional post-event seismic damage assessment procedure based on convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed. In this approach, an inventory of buildings, anticipated ground motion datasets, and corresponding damage levels for a region are brought together into a scenario bank. The time-frequency distribution graphs of the ground motions, which serve as detailed visual representations of their frequency-domain as well as time-domain features, are generated. These data are then used to train CNN models, which could predict the damage states. The proposed methodology is verified through two numerical studies—one for an individual building, and the other, regional case, involving the buildings in the Tsinghua University campus. The results confirm that the proposed method offers prediction results with sufficient accuracy in near real-time. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. convolutional neural network (CNN)  real-time  seismic damage prediction  time-frequency distribution (TFD) Bridge components  Convolutional neural networks  Damage detection  Frequency domain analysis  Losses  Robustness (control systems)  Seismic response  Structural analysis  Time domain analysis  Uncertainty analysis  Nonlinear time history analysis  On site investigations  Seismic damage assessment  Time domain features  Time-frequency distributions  Traditional approaches  Tsinghua University  Visual representations  Deep learning  building  ground motion  machine learning  real time  seismic response  temporal distribution",A deep learning approach to rapid regional post-event seismic damage assessment using time-frequency distributions of ground motions,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05774838001423575,0.011102806563945227,0.007330385960875121,0.5627736419054853,ML

21675,"Surrogate probabilistic seismic demand modelling of inelastic single-degree-of-freedom systems for efficient earthquake risk applications This paper proposes surrogate models (or metamodels) mapping the parameters controlling the dynamic behaviour of inelastic single-degree-of-freedom (SDoF) systems (i.e., force-displacement capacity curve, hysteretic behaviour) and the parameters of their probabilistic seismic demand model (PSDM, i.e., conditional distribution of an engineering demand parameter [EDP] given a ground-motion intensity measure [IM]). These metamodels allow the rapid derivation of fragility curves of SDoF representation of structures. Gaussian Process (GP) regression is selected as the metamodelling approach because of their flexibility in implementation, the resulting accuracy and computational efficiency. The metamodel training dataset includes 10,000 SDoF systems analysed via cloud-based non-linear time-history analysis (NLTHA) using recorded ground motions. The proposed GP regressions are tested in predicting the PSDM of both the SDoF database (through ten-fold cross validation) and eight realistic reinforced concrete (RC) frames, benchmarking the results against NLTHA. An application is conducted to propagate such modelling uncertainty to both fragility and vulnerability/loss estimations. Error levels are deemed satisfactory for practical applications, especially considering the low required modelling effort and analysis time. Regarding single-building applications enabled by the proposed metamodel, this paper presents a first attempt at a direct loss-based design procedure, which allows setting a target loss level for the designed structure (shown for a realistic RC frame). An earthquake risk model involving dynamic exposure and vulnerability modules is illustrated as an example of building portfolio applications. Specifically, the proposed application considers a retrofit-based seismic risk-reduction policy for a synthetic building portfolio, for which it is possible estimating the loss evolution over time. © 2021 The Authors.

20096,"Residential building flood damage: Insights on processes and implications for risk assessments Flood damage assessments provide critical insights on processes controlling building damage and loss. Here, we present a novel damage assessment approach to develop an empirical residential building damage database from five flood events in New Zealand. Object-level damage data was collected for flood hazard and building characteristics, along with relative building component and sub-components damage ratios. A Random Forest Model and Spearman's Rank correlation test were applied to analyse damage data variable importance and monotonic relationships. Model and test results reveal flood inundation depth above first finished floor level is highly important and strongly correlated with total building damage ratios while flow velocity is important for structure component damage. Internal finishes components contribute highly to total building damage ratios as higher value sub-component materials are susceptible to direct damage from water contact and indirect damage during repair. The empirical damage data has several implications for damage model development due to the limited heterogeneity of flood hazard intensities and building attributes observed. Extending empirical damage data with synthetic damage data in future would support development of more representative object-specific damage models to evaluate direct tangible damages for local contexts. © 2022 The Authors.

20147,"Review of failure risk and outage prediction in power system under wind hazards✰ Given that wind hazards pose a considerable damage to power system in various countries, researchers have developed methods for disaster prevention to diminish the vulnerabilities. This paper attempts to review the failure analysis procedure under the impact of wind hazards, considering the following attributes: wind field generation method, wind-induced electrical component failure model in transmission system, and building outage prediction model from data-driven view in distribution system. First, we compare the calculation of circulation and translation wind speed, with geographical, temporal and uncertainty factors of wind speed considered. Then, we introduce the wind-induced component failure models derived by wind load calculation and fragility curves. The application of the series reliability model in multiple cluster failures is briefly described. Finally, we summarize the applications of data analysis in building outage prediction models. The reviewed literature contains the statistical learning methods and machine learning methods. It is concluded that the frameworks for component-level failure model and user-level outage prediction model are well established. However, most of the studies still develop two models, separately. Future researchers may target at the hybrid application of both models to better provide fault analysis, prediction and emergency in power system under wind hazards. © 2022 Failure probability  Fragility curves  Machine learning  Outage prediction model  Wind hazards  Zero-inflated Disaster prevention  Electric power transmission  Forecasting  Hazards  Machine learning  Wind  Component failure model  Failure Probability  Failure risk  Fragility curves  Outage prediction model  Power  Prediction modelling  Wind hazards  Wind speed  Zero-inflated  Outages",Review of failure risk and outage prediction in power system under wind hazards✰,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09212398432631924,0.006187390584050695,0.009060284561910827,0.8418347483057931,ML
18023,"Fragility curves for RC framed buildings considering cumulative damage due to earthquake ground motion and slow-moving landslides Differential settlements during earthquake ground shaking at the base of framed buildings located on the crest of slopes can produce heavy damage. This reflects the importance of considering ground shaking and co-seismic vertical displacements as interacting hazards in seismic fragility assessment. Slow-moving landslides are indeed secondary hazards of earthquakes that can induce significant damage accumulation, increasing the seismic vulnerability of structures. This paper presents the main findings of a seismic fragility analysis that was carried out on RC framed structures representative of low-rise, pre-code, residential Italian buildings. The methodology behind this study made use of fibre-based structural models and sequential nonlinear static analysis, which allowed the simulation of structural response to both earthquake ground motion and differential settlements with acceptable computational cost. Based on multivariate regression models available in the literature and random sampling of structures, seismically-induced settlements at the base of each structure were simulated considering multiple intensity measures (IMs) of seismic ground shaking. The correlation between the selected IMs was derived through a recent database of 250 accelerograms, which allow a wide representation of seismic hazard in the whole Italian territory for seismic risk assessment. The buildings were analysed with OpenSees software, assuming four performance limit states for characterization of seismic fragility at multiple levels of structural damage. The comparison between fragility curves associated with earthquake ground shaking only and those derived considering differential settlements allows the impact of cumulative damage to be evaluated. © 2021 COMPDYN Proceedings.

15090,"A contribution to the seismic performance and loss assessment of old RC wall-frame buildings This paper deals with the seismic performance and loss assessment of old RC wall-frame buildings in Lisbon, Portugal. These structures are characterised by non-ductile columns and RC walls made with smooth rebars and light transversal reinforcement. They were erected before the introduction of modern seismic codes in the 1980s and represent an important proportion of the city's building stock. The research reported in this paper focuses on the seismic vulnerability assessment of this building typology. An analytical procedure is proposed to estimate the fragility functions of non-ductile reinforced concrete walls with smooth reinforcing bars and light transversal reinforcement, taking into account strength penetration effects. To illustrate the procedure, a case study building is considered. The approach used for the seismic performance assessment adopts component-based fragility and loss functions for the damage assessment of the structural and non-structural drift-sensitive elements, adapted to the Portuguese reality, and a storey-based approach for acceleration-sensitive non-structural elements. The results provide the economic loss of the building as a function of the ground motion intensity level.

This paper presents a multivariable flood damage assessment based on data from residential building and content damage from the Bago flood event of July 2018. This study aims to identify the influences on building and content losses. We developed a regression-based flood loss estimation model, which incorporates factors such as water depth, flood duration, building material, building age, building condition, number of stories, and floor level. Regression approaches, such as stepwise and best subset regression, were used to create the flood damage model. The selection was based on Akaike's information criterion (AIC).

21225,"Seismic vulnerability of existing non-seismic reinforced concrete framed buildings The fragility curves for yielding and collapse damage levels are developed with lognormal distribution assumption. A method for obtaining the fragility curves of existing non-seismic, nonductile, gravity load designed typical midrise, four storeyed reinforced concrete frame buildings is defined. The fragility curves are constructed in terms of peak ground acceleration and elastic spectral acceleration under the effect of ten ground motions. Incremental Dynamic Analysis procedure is adopted here for the analysis of the sample building. The yielding and collapse damage levels are considered as they can be determined analytically with reasonable accuracy. These fragility curves express at a glance the probability of yielding and collapse against various selected intensity values. Hazard survival curves are plotted by changing the horizontal axis of fragility curves from intensity values to annual probability of occurrence of earthquakes using the earthquake recurrence relationship. The analysis quantifies the vulnerability of the sample building under the probable earthquakes.

In order to evaluate the seismic fragility of Shenguang-Ⅲ target building, the paper performs a series of nonlinear time-history analyses on the target building subjected to the Wenchuan earthquake waves supplied by China National Strong Motion Network Center. Besides, the damage index is the maximum interlayer drift angle, and the earthquake intensity index is PGA (Peak Ground Acceleration). Based on the seismic fragility analysis method, the seismic fragility curves and matrix are obtained.

15472,"Ambient vibration testing and seismic fragility analysis of masonry building aggregates Over the years, masonry structures have shown evidence of good behavior under vertical static loads; however, its characteristics make the use of this heterogeneous material unsuitable for buildings in seismic zones. Masonry building aggregates represent a common structural typology in many cities around the world. The present work addresses the seismic vulnerability assessment of an aggregate of mixed masonry-RC buildings in the region of Lisbon, which is characterized by moderate to high seismicity. Moreover, this typology was built before the enforcement of the first design code for building safety against earthquakes in Portugal (RSSCS). The numerical models were developed using the Applied Element Method (AEM) and calibrated based on experimental tests. The modeling technique applied was capable to identify the global and local failure mechanisms. A probabilistic approach allowed to compute the uncertainty in the seismic response, based on nonlinear static analyses. The site-specific ground motion was simulated using a non-stationary stochastic method. Subsequent fragility curves were derived, showing a significant probability that the structure will suffer moderate to extensive damage for a code compliant seismic assessment, corresponding to a 308-years return period and onshore seismic action. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

15335,"A review on application of soft computing techniques for the rapid visual safety evaluation and damage classification of existing buildings Seismic vulnerability assessment of existing buildings is of great concern around the world. Different countries develop various approaches and methodologies to overcome the disastrous effects of earthquakes on the structural parameters of the building and the human losses. There are structures still in service with a high seismic vulnerability, which proposes an urgent need for a screening system's damageability grading system. Rapid urbanization and the proliferation of slums give rise to improper construction practices that make the building stock's reliability ambiguous, including old structures that were constructed either when the seismic codes were not advanced or not enforced by law. Despite having a good knowledge of structural analysis, it is impractical to conduct detailed nonlinear analysis on each building in the target area to define their seismic vulnerability. This indicates the necessity of developing a rapid, reliable, and computationally easy method of seismic vulnerability assessment, more commonly known as Rapid Visual Screening (RVS). This method begins with a walk-down survey by a trained evaluator, and an initial score is assigned to the structure. Further, the vulnerability parameters are defined (predictor variables), and the damage grades are defined. Various methods are then adopted to develop an optimum correlation between the parameters and damage grades. Soft Computing (SC) techniques including probabilistic approaches, meta-heuristics, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) theories such as artificial neural networks, machine learning, fuzzy logic, etc. due to their capabilities in targeting inherent imprecision of phenomena in real-world are among the most important and widely used approaches in this regard. In this paper, a comprehensive literature review of the most commonly used and newly developed innovative methodologies in RVS using powerful SC techniques has been presented to shed light on key factors, strengths, and applications of each SC technique in advancing the RVS field of study.

15433,"Adaptability and transferability of flood loss functions in residential areas Flood loss modeling is an important component within flood risk assessments. Traditionally, stage-damage functions are used for the estimation of direct monetary damage to buildings. Although it is known that such functions are governed by large uncertainties, they are commonly applied - even in different geographical regions - without further validation, mainly due to the lack of real damage data. Until now, little research has been done to investigate the applicability and transferability of such damage models to other regions. In this study, the last severe flood event in the Austrian Lech Valley in 2005 was simulated to test the performance of various damage functions from different geographical regions in Central Europe for the residential sector. In addition to common stage-damage curves, new functions were derived from empirical flood loss data collected in the aftermath of recent flood events in neighboring Germany. Furthermore, a multi-parameter flood loss model for the residential sector was adapted to the study area and also evaluated with official damage data. The analysis reveals that flood loss functions derived from related and more similar regions perform considerably better than those from more heterogeneous data sets of different regions and flood events. While former loss functions estimate the observed damage well, the latter overestimate the reported loss clearly. To illustrate the effect of model choice on the resulting uncertainty of damage estimates, the current flood risk for residential areas was calculated. In the case of extreme events like the 300 yr flood, for example, the range of losses to residential buildings between the highest and the lowest estimates amounts to a factor of 18, in contrast to properly validated models with a factor of 2.3. Even if the risk analysis is only performed for residential areas, our results reveal evidently that a carefree model transfer in other geographical regions might be critical. Therefore, we conclude that loss models should at least be selected or derived from related regions with similar flood and building characteristics, as far as no model validation is possible. To further increase the general reliability of flood loss assessment in the future, more loss data and more comprehensive loss data for model development and validation are needed. Â© 2013 Author(s).

18217,"Hazus-compatible seismic fragility analysis for rc frame structures As a kind of multi-disaster loss assessment software, HAZUS is world-widely used. Determining the seismic fragility functions of structures is the key issue of HAZUS to conduct seismic loss assessment. However, traditional seismic fragility results cannot match the format requirement of HAZUS. In light of this, this paper presents a simplified approach to derive the HAZUS-compatible seismic fragility curves. This method directly uses the traditional seismic fragility results and transforms them to the HAZUS format through employing the capacity-diagram method to determine parameters in terms of spectral displacements for used ground motion records. To illustrate the proposed method, four RC frame structures of various heights are selected as study cases, and the results by the proposed method and those by the HAZUS-provided fragility curves are compared. Results show that the HAZUS-compatible seismic fragility results have significant difference from HAZUS-provided seismic fragility curves since they adopt different analysis methods and face to different study objectives. © 2016, Engineering Mechanics Press.

22248,"Vulnerability assessment of RC buildings to lateral spreading Large magnitude earthquakes have historically caused devastating damage to engineered structures as a result of permanent ground deformations induced by soil liquefaction (e.g. 1964 Niigata earthquake, 1995 Kobe earthquake, 2010–2011 Christchurch earthquakes). A relevant amount of such damages is directly connected to liquefaction induced lateral spreading. This paper deals with the capacity of concrete framed structures with shallow foundations to handle lateral spreading demands. A simplified force–displacement compatible model was developed to capture the loads on the shallow foundations and estimate the performance of the building. The key parameters of foundation embedment, foundation width and shear length of the pillar, as well as soil friction angle were identified as having a strong influence on the expected performance. The developed model was used to develop probabilistic fragility curves for a class of buildings representing two to five storeys reinforced concrete buildings. Field measurements from existing literature of the liquefaction induced lateral displacement demand from the the September 4, 2010 (Mw 7.1) and the February 22, 2011 (Mw 6.2) Canterbury (New Zealand) earthquakes along the Avon River were probabilistically quantified in relation to the distance from the river. Finally, the displacement demand and fragility curves were used to estimate the probability of exceeding the considered limit states as a function of the distance from the river. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

15886,"Bayesian Inference for Uncertainty-Aware Post-Disaster Damage Assessment Using Artificial Intelligence Climate disasters cause significant loss of life and damage to properties and infrastructure. In a disaster aftermath, building inspectors conduct preliminary damage assessment (PDA), which, depending on the size and population of the affected areas, may be slow and resource-intensive. In this paper, we present an uncertainty-aware convolutional neural network (CNN) for PDA by incorporating a Bayesian framework and implementing Monte Carlo (MC) dropout sampling to efficiently approximate the Bayesian inferences. Using dropouts not only during training but also at the inference time allows the CNN model to represent softmax probabilities of the damage prediction as random variables, enabling a more rigorous and systematic characterization of uncertainty and confidence in model predictions. The model is trained and evaluated with non-deterministic ground-truth damage scores obtained through crowdsourcing from drone footage of a hurricane-affected area. Results indicate that the trained uncertainty-aware CNN model leads to more informed and reliable PDA outcomes. © 2021 Computing in Civil Engineering 2021 - Selected Papers from the ASCE International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering 2021.

18771,"Machine Learning-Based Approach for Seismic Damage Prediction Method of Building Structures Considering Soil-Structure Interaction Conventional seismic performance evaluation methods for building structures with soil-structure interaction effects are inefficient for regional seismic damage assessment as a predisaster management system. Therefore, this study presented the framework to develop an artificial neural network-based model, which can rapidly predict seismic responses with soil-structure interaction effects and determine the seismic performance levels.

17564,"Examination of the Efficiency of Retrofitting Methods through Fragility Analysis Turkey had several devastating earthquakes throughout its history as it is located in a highly seismically active region. Thus, seismic evaluation and retrofitting of the existing structures to decrease the potential damage of the future earthquakes is an essential part of the earthquake relief plans. The aim of this study is to examine the efficiency of widely used two retrofitting methods of existing structures through fragility analysis. Fragility curves are useful tools to show the probability of structural damage due to earthquakes as a function of ground motion indices. Fragility curves of a hypothetical residential building which represents the existing building stock have been generated. Furthermore, fragility curves of two retrofitted building have also been obtained. The first one is a frame with jacketed columns and the second one has shear walls added to the existing frame. Fragility curves have been obtained based on both local and global damage criteria limits in terms of interstory drift ratio. The obtained damage probabilities have shown that the damage criteria either local or global which are used for generation of fragility curves are significantly effective on the results. Differences in damage probability indicate the importance of the damage criteria and corresponding limits used for the determination of damage probability.

19300,"On the vulnerability assessment of monumental buildings In all European countries the will to conserve the building heritage is very strong. Unfortunately, large areas in Europe are characterised by a high level of seismic hazard and the vulnerability of ancient masonry structures is often relevant. The large number of monumental buildings in urban areas requires facing the problem with a methodology that can be applied at territorial scale, with simplified models which need little easily obtainable, data. Within the Risk-UE project, a new methodology has been stated for the seismic vulnerability assessment of monumental buildings, which considers two different approaches: a macroseismic model, to be used with macroseismic intensity hazard maps, and a mechanical based model, to be applied when the hazard is provided in terms of peak ground accelerations and spectral values. Both models can be used with data of different reliability and depth. This paper illustrates the theoretical basis and defines the parameters of the two models.

15334,"A REVIEW OF TSUNAMI DAMAGE ASSESSMENT METHODS AND BUILDING PERFORMANCE IN THAILAND Although the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami occurred several years ago and all the building repair and infrastructure reconstruction needed in Thailand to repair the damage caused by the tsunami are complete, there is still a need for damage assessment methods that can be used in future tsunami damage assessments in Thailand and that can possibly be applied to other countries. This study summarizes three methods for assessing tsunami damage, tsunami damage criteria, tsunami damage ratios and  tsunami fragility curves, based on damage data from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami in Thailand, and these methods are compared using other tsunami events. Using the data from a field survey of damaged buildings, tsunami damage criteria were summarized for each degree of damage as a function of inundation depth for different building types. Tsunami damage ratios were summarized using building damage data obtained from surveys in the field and reconstruction cost estimates provided by the Thai government. The fragility curves developed were validated based on building performance data obtained from full-scale experiments on buildings and columns. Despite differences in the tsunami characteristics (inundation depth, current velocity and hydrodynamic force), the damage probabilities were nearly the same. The summarized methods might be useful for future tsunami damage assessments and loss estimation in Thailand and serve as guidelines for tsunami damage assessment in other countries. 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami  damage assessment  building damage  damage ratio  tsunami fragility FRAGILITY CURVES",A REVIEW OF TSUNAMI DAMAGE ASSESSMENT METHODS AND BUILDING PERFORMANCE IN THAILAND,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2998399230128971,0.2714893292214882,0.06541915583414798,0.005136631666655992,Analytical
19780,"Probabilistic seismic assessment of the pounding risk based on the local demands of a multistory RC frame structure The aim of this study is to incorporate the local inelastic demands of a multistory reinforced concrete (RC) frame structure for the first time in the probabilistic seismic assessment of the pounding risk. Two distinct types of structural pounding are examined: a) the floor-to-floor structural pounding - Type A, and b) the inter-story (floor-to-column) structural pounding - Type B. Three different initial gap distances dg between the adjacent structures are considered. The seismic performance of the RC frame structure without the pounding effect is also estimated. The probabilistic evaluation of the pounding effect is performed through fragility curves in terms of global and local engineering demand parameters (EDPs) as a function of the peak ground acceleration (PGA). The first part of this research is focused on the development of global and local probabilistic seismic demand models (PSDMs) against pounding risk. For this purpose, linear and bilinear regression models have been used. Afterwards, the fragility assessment of the RC frame against pounding is performed (a) as a function of the separation gap distance dg, (b) based on the global seismic performances, and (c) based on the local seismic performances. A compounded fragility-based solution on evaluating the pounding risk at different performance levels is also presented and new performance levels thresholds are introduced. Results indicate that the local performances of the columns of the RC structure are crucial demand parameters for the probabilistic assessment of the pounding risk. The type of the structural pounding (Type A or Type B) that is occurred between the adjacent structures significantly alters the results of the probabilistic assessment when the local performances are considered. The compounded evaluation of the pounding risk clearly indicates that the RC frame structure exceeds the examined performance levels at a lower value of PGA when subjected to pounding in comparison to the corresponding cases without pounding. Finally, a decision method is presented as an approach to estimate the minimum separation gap distance dg,min between adjacent structures when global and local performances are incorporated in the fragility assessment process. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd Eurocode 8  Fragility curves  Global engineering demands  Linear and bilinear PSDMs  Local engineering demands  Nonlinear dynamic analyses  Performance levels  Probabilistic assessment  RC frame structure  Structural pounding Dynamics  Floors  Function evaluation  Regression analysis  Reinforced concrete  Risk assessment  Seismic waves  Structural frames  Eurocode 8  Fragility curves  Global engineering demand  Linear and bilinear probabilistic seismic demand model  Local engineering demand  Non-linear dynamic analysis  Performance:level  Probabilistic assessments  Reinforced concrete frame structures  Structural pounding  Seismology  building code  dynamic analysis  ground motion  multistorey building  probability  reinforced concrete  risk assessment  seismic hazard  seismic pounding",Probabilistic seismic assessment of the pounding risk based on the local demands of a multistory RC frame structure,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22969960479223467,0.017085522776102077,0.014132694105681435,0.030254369490544174,Analytical

The stochastic analysis includes possible component and connection failures, load redistribution based on progressive failure, spatial distribution of wind load, and internal pressure variation caused by roof sheeting failure. This spatial and time-dependent reliability analysis will enable fragility curves to be developed that relate likelihood and extent of roof cover damage with wind speed. Industrial buildings representative of new construction in the Australian cities of Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne are considered. Fragility functions are proposed for industrial buildings designed and constructed to existing codes, and also for improperly designed or constructed buildings where a roller door or other dominant opening prematurely fails during a storm for a building designed as nominally sealed.

20522,"Seismic fragilities of non-ductile reinforced concrete frames with consideration of soil structure interaction Seismic fragilities of buildings are often developed without consideration of soil-structure interaction (SSI), where base of the building is assumed to be fixed. This study highlights effect of SSI and uncertainty in soil properties such as friction angle, cohesion, density, shear modulus and Poisson's ratio and foundation parameters on seismic fragilities of non-ductile reinforced concrete frames resting in dense silty sand. Three-, five-, and nine-storey three-bay moment resisting reinforced concrete frames resting on isolated shallow foundation are studied and the numerical models for SSI are developed in OpenSees. Three sets of 10 ground motions, with mean spectrum of 100, 500, and 1000. yr return period hazard level (matching EC-8 design spectrum), are used for the nonlinear time history analyses. An optimized Latin Hyper Cube sampling technique is used to draw the sample of soil properties and foundation parameters. The fragilities are developed for the fixed base model and SSI models. However, the fragilities that incorporate the soil parameter and foundation uncertainties are only slightly different from those based solely on the uncertainty in seismic demand from earthquake ground motion, suggesting that fragilities that are developed under the assumption that all soil and foundation parameters at their median (or mean) values are sufficient for the purpose of earthquake damage or loose estimation of structures resting on dense silty sand. But the consideration of the SSI effect has the significant influence on the fragilities compare to the fixed base model.

19895,"Quantitative Tsunami Risk Assessment in Terms of Building Replacement Cost Based on Tsunami Modelling and GIS Methods: The Case of Crete Isl., Hellenic Arc Tsunami risk assessment is an important component of the planning for risk reduction. We considered tsunami risk as a convolution of tsunami hazard, vulnerability of the assets at risk (e.g. buildings) and the economic value exposed. For testing the model, a coastal segment at the west of Heraklion, capital city of Crete Isl., Greece, was selected. Heraklion was hit in the past by strong tectonic and volcanic tsunamis, generated along the Hellenic Arc in the Mediterranean region. The Minoan tsunami produced by pyroclastic flows during the LBA (17th century BC) great eruption of Thera (Santorini) was selected as an extreme tsunami scenario for the hazard (inundation) zone determination through numerical simulation based on Boussinesq equations for fully non-linear waves. It was found that the wave penetrates inland up to1.2km, while the maximum water depth is14m. The building stock was obtained from the 2011 national census data and validated with the use of orthophotomaps, field inspection and Google Maps. Building vulnerability was determined with the use of the empirical GIS tool DAMASCHE which is based on 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami building damage data and produces damage level by combining water depth and building construction types. The damage level was translated to absolute monetary loss on the basis of cost flat rates determined officially for building replacement, i.e., either reparation or reconstruction, after the destructive earthquakes in Greece during 2014. The method is applicable in other parts of the Mediterranean and beyond provided that appropriate data are available.

12636,"Assessment of Seismic Vulnerability of Steel and RC Moment Buildings Using HAZUS and Statistical Methodologies Designer engineers have always the serious challenge regarding the choice of the kind of structures to use in the areas with significant seismic activities. Development of fragility curve provides an opportunity for designers to select a structure that will have the least fragility. This paper presents an investigation into the seismic vulnerability of both steel and reinforced concrete (RC) moment frames using fragility curves obtained by HAZUS and statistical methodologies. Fragility curves are employed for several probability parameters. Fragility curves are used to assess several probability parameters. Furthermore, it examines whether the probability of the exceedence of the damage limit state is reduced as expected. Nonlinear dynamic analyses of five-, eight-, and twelve-story frames are carried out using Perform 3D. The definition of damage states is based on the descriptions provided by HAZUS, which gives the limit states and the associated interstory drift limits for structures. The fragility curves show that the HAZUS procedure reduces probability of damage, and this reduction is higher for RC frames. Generally, the RC frames have higher fragility compared to steel frames. © 2017 Iman Mansouri et al.

12615,"Are OpenStreetMap building data useful for flood vulnerability modelling? Flood risk modelling aims to quantify the probability of flooding and the resulting consequences for exposed elements. The assessment of flood damage is a core task that requires the description of complex flood damage processes including the influences of flooding intensity and vulnerability characteristics. Multi-variable modelling approaches are better suited for this purpose than simple stage-damage functions. However, multi-variable flood vulnerability models require detailed input data and often have problems in predicting damage for regions other than those for which they have been developed. A transfer of vulnerability models usually results in a drop of model predictive performance. Here we investigate the questions as to whether data from the open-data source OpenStreetMap is suitable to model flood vulnerability of residential buildings and whether the underlying standardized data model is helpful for transferring models across regions. We develop a new data set by calculating numerical spatial measures for residential-building footprints and combining these variables with an empirical data set of observed flood damage. From this data set random forest regression models are learned using regional subsets and are tested for predicting flood damage in other regions. This regional split-sample validation approach reveals that the predictive performance of models based on OpenStreetMap building geometry data is comparable to alternative multi-variable models, which use comprehensive and detailed information about preparedness, socio-economic status and other aspects of residential-building vulnerability. The transfer of these models for application in other regions should include a test of model performance using independent local flood data. Including numerical spatial measures based on OpenStreetMap building footprints reduces model prediction errors (MAE - mean absolute error - by 20% and MSE - mean squared error - by 25 %) and increases the reliability of model predictions by a factor of 1.4 in terms of the hit rate when compared to a model that uses only water depth as a predictor. This applies also when the models are transferred to other regions which have not been used for model learning. Further, our results show that using numerical spatial measures derived from OpenStreetMap building footprints does not resolve all problems of model transfer. Still, we conclude that these variables are useful proxies for flood vulnerability modelling because these data are consistent (i.e. input variables and underlying data model have the same definition, format, units, etc.) and openly accessible and thus make it easier and more cost-effective to transfer vulnerability models to other regions.

12949,"Fragility analysis methods: Review of existing approaches and application In seismic reliability analysis the total failure probability is determined by combining the fragility curve – representing the response of the structure to seismic excitation – with the seismic hazard curve. The determination of fragility curves has a long tradition in the nuclear industry and reaches back to the 1970s. Since the late 1990s also for ordinary buildings seismic reliability analysis became more important and formed the bases for the development of new seismic standards. Several methods are available to build fragility curves. They are relying on different assumptions and restrictions, as well as levels of detail. In this paper, different fragility analysis methods are described and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed: (i) the safety factor method, in which the fragility curve is estimated based on safety margins with respect on an existing deterministic design; the numerical simulation method, in which the parameters of the fragility curve are obtained by (ii) regression analysis or (iii) maximum likelihood estimation from a set of nonlinear time history analysis at different seismic levels; (iv) the incremental dynamic analysis method where a set of accelerograms is scaled until failure. These four fragility analysis methods are applied to determine fragility curves for the 3-storey reinforced concrete shear wall building of the SMART2013 benchmark project.

12528,"A gui framework for the development of fragility curves for a low-rise & medium-rise buildings “Earthquake’s do kill the people.” It is a clear misconception. Earthquakes never kill, but it is always the constructional failure which makes the situation worse and leads to the loss of life. Earthquake’s root to a huge economic loss apart from the tortuous pain of loss of lives. This calls for the need of seismic strengthening as the circumgyrations are inevitable. Seismic strengthening improves the structural safety but does not reduce the seismic response. Seismic strengthening is a pre-disaster assessment. But the need to study the observance of the existing buildings against the circumgyrations lead to a stew of post-disaster mitigation with pre-disaster planning known as Fragility analysis. Fragility analysis refers to the partial assessment of vulnerability of the buildings subjected to earthquake motions. In this study, the fragility curves are developed with the aid of Incremental dynamic analysis or Nonlinear dynamic analysis conducted on the model. The curves explain the conditional anticipation which outstrip adefinite limit of failure and therefore guesstimate the susceptibility of the structure. Fragility curves are very much useful in seismic loss estimation studies in earth quake prone zones.

In this respect, the fragility curves of building type structural simulations for four different ground motion dataset and three selected intensity measures are developed by considering two different approaches and possible variations are investigated. The detailed evaluations which depend on the fragility curves and the deterministic earthquake scenarios indicate that the compiled ground motion datasets, selected intensity measures and fragility curve development approaches can considerably affect the analysis results.

20425,"Seismic damage assessment of rc frame structures based on vulnerabilty index An index in terms of vulnerability index is proposed to assess structural damage due to earthquake based on conventional seismic fragility analysis. The methodology of assessing earthquake consequences at the regional scale using the damage index is adopted and the numerical expectation of the damage index is calculated to quantify the vulnerability index of an individual building, where the damage state probability is derived through analytical seismic fragility analysis. Two groups of RC frames of 8- and 10-story height are considered as study cases, each of which includes frames designed to various seismic fortification levels. Seismic fragility curves, damage state probability curves, vulnerability index curves and vulnerability indices at frequent earthquake (FE), design-based earthquake (DBE) and maximum consider earthquake (MCE) intensities are computed separately. The results show that the RC frames designed according to the current Chinese codes can basically satisfy the performance requirements of ""no damage under FE"", ""no unrepairable damage under DBE"" and ""no collapse under MCE"". At MCE intensities, the reference frames illustrate good performance of controlling the occurrence of severe damages. Structural resistance against earthquake is enhanced due to the increase of seismic fortification level; however the conditional seismic vulnerability indices upon FE, DBE and MCE are increased accordingly. © 2017, Engineering Mechanics Press.

22034,"Typological damage fragility curves for unreinforced masonry buildings affected by the 2009 l'aquila, italy earthquake Background: Seismic risk mitigation has become a crucial issue due to the great number of casualties and large economic losses registered after recent earthquakes. In particular, unreinforced masonry constructions built before modern seismic codes, common in Italy and in other seismic-prone areas, are characterized by great vulnerability. In order to implement mitigation policies, analytical tools are necessary to generate scenario simulations. Methods: Therefore, data collected during inspections after the 2009 L’Aquila, Italy earthquake are used to derive novel fragility functions. Compared to previous studies, data are interpreted accounting for the presence of buildings not inspected due to those being undamaged. An innovative building damage state is proposed and is based on the response of different structural elements recorded in the survey form: vertical structures, horizontal structures, stairs, roof, and partition walls. In the suggested formulation, the combination of their performance is weighted based on typical reparation techniques and on the relative size of the structural elements, estimated from a database of complete geometrical surveys developed specifically for this study. Moreover, the proposed building damage state estimates earthquake-related damage by removing the preexisting damage reported in the inspection form. Results: Lognormal fragility curves, in terms of building damage state grade as a function of typological classes and peak ground acceleration, derived maximizing their likelihood and their merits compared with previous studies are highlighted. Conclusion: The correction of the database to account for uninspected buildings delivers curves that are less “stiff” and reach the median for lower peak ground acceleration values. The building feature that influences most the fragility is the masonry quality. © 2021 Zucconi et al.

21181,"Seismic Vulnerability Assessment of Reinforced Concrete Buildings and Establishment of Fragility Curves as a Structural Damage Prevention Criterion for the Moroccan Real Estate Earthquakes are one of the most feared natural disasters by their nature and their unpredictable violence. Until now, it is still impossible to predict earthquakes in an acceptable way. The nature of the data needed to predict the exact date, magnitude and location of an earthquake is still unpredictable, but this can be assessed by taking appropriate measures to limit the loss and material damage caused by earthquakes. The prediction of damage to a building during an earthquake is the major concern of engineers and researchers in earthquake engineering. The use of a mechanism to identify the dispersion of damage to a reinforced concrete structure according to the ranges of values and parameters calculated for several earthquakes is necessary. Thus, Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA), which is a non-linear dynamic analysis that offers an immense opportunity to evaluate seismic responses of the structure while combining these, results with fragility curves to predict in a probabilistic way the effects of an earthquake on the structure. This work therefore makes it possible to evaluate the ability of these indicators to predict the damage of two projects of structures buildings of reinforced concrete frames, the first is a typical project of the Moroccan real estate park and the second is a structure that allows studying the height setting of the structure and number of floors. In conclusion, determine an order of magnitude of the dispersion of the damage that a structure undergoes during an earthquake characterized by its indicators and parameters. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

12797,"Development of fragility curves for confined masonry buildings in Lima, Peru This paper aims at investigating the seismic fragility of confined masonry (CM) structures in Lima, Peru, which can be used to perform earthquake scenarios at urban scale. A database describing the geometric properties (walls density, building area, height) of this type of structure was developed using data from field surveys. This information was complemented with results from experimental tests to compute a large set of capacity curves using a mechanical procedure. These models were tested against a set of ground motion records using the displacement-based earthquake loss assessment (DBELA) procedure, and the structural responses were used to derive fragility functions for four building classes. The resulting fragility curves were convoluted with seismic hazard curves to evaluate the annualized expected loss ratio and annual collapse probability. © 2018, Earthquake Engineering Research Institute.

16900,"Development of fragility curves for base isolated RC structures Despite assessing the efficacy of base isolation systems on seismic performance of existing structures in former investigations using deterministic methods, it will be useful to assess the effect of these systems on the structural performance of buildings through probabilistic methods such as developing fragility curves. This study considers three 2-D reinforced concrete moment-resisting frame structures with different heights (3, 7, 12 stories). These structures are rehabilitated using Lead Rubber Bearing (LRB) isolators based on FEMA 356 instructions. Two sets of 7 records including near-fault and far-field records resting on stiff soil are selected to consider seismic uncertainty. Structural uncertainties are considered through modeling different material properties as random variables using Monte Carlo simulation method. Nonlinear time-history analyses will be conducted using open-source platform OpenSees for each level of seismic intensity parameter (here CAV) and using Park-Ang damage index for RC building and shear strain for isolators finally fragility curves are developed. There is a high correlation between CAV levels and mean damage. These fragility curves can be helpful to assess effects of adding base isolation systems in seismic demand of structures in each damage state.

17869,"Flood-damage curves: Methodological development for the Brazilian context The present paper describes the main results of an on-going research aiming to develop standard flood damage data in the form of generic flood-damage curves. This type of curve allows estimating flood damages from the depth of inundation. Although the research project encompasses flood damages on different urban land use activities (residential, commercial, services and industrial land uses), the paper focus on residential flood damage information. The empirical data used on this research was obtained from systematic surveys performed in the city of Itajuba town with 85.000 inhabitants located in the Sapucai river valley in the South-eastern region of Brazil, during the year of 2002. The survey consisted in interviewing residents in the Itajuba flood prone urban area in order to develop a data base characterizing the social class, the building fabric, the contents (inventory items) and the damages caused to dwellings by a reference flood event, the 2000 flood event. During this event, the town had more than 70% of its urban area flooded for three days and, in some densely urbanised areas, the depth of water was superior to three meters. The FDC curves obtained show relatively high damage according to the submersion depth considering the Brazilian context. This issue suggests that inhabitants can rarely recover, in the short time, from all the harm caused by flooding.

12959,"Fragility assessment of a RC structure under tsunami actions via nonlinear static and dynamic analyses Current guidelines for design and assessment of buildings under tsunami actions do not explicitly state how to apply tsunami loads to buildings and which analysis methods to use in order to assess the structural response to the tsunami loads. In this paper, a reinforced concrete (RC) moment-resisting frame, which is designed as a tsunami evacuation building, is selected as a case study and subjected to simulated 2011 Tohoku tsunami waves. To assess tsunami impact on the model building, different nonlinear static analyses, i.e. constant-height pushover (CHPO) and variable-height pushover (VHPO), are compared with nonlinear dynamic analysis. The results of VHPO provide a good prediction of engineering demand parameters and collapse fragility curves obtained from the dynamic analysis under a wide range of tsunami loading. On the other hand, CHPO tends to overestimate interstorey drift ratio (IDR) and underestimate column shear by about 5–20%. It provides a larger fragility, i.e. about 10% in median value, for global failure and a smaller fragility for local shear failure. On the basis of these results, it is recommended that VHPO be used in future fragility analysis of buildings subjected to tsunami. However, pushover methods might not be adequate in cases where the tsunami inundation force time-histories are characterised by a “double-peak”, which subjects the structure to a two-cycle load. Finally, it is found that tsunami peak force is better correlated to IDR than flow velocity and inundation depth for the considered structure. This suggests that the peak force would be a more efficient intensity measure than the other two in the development of tsunami fragility curves. © 2017 The Authors Analysis methodology  Fragility curve  Pushover analysis  Time-history analysis  Tsunami engineering  Tsunami force  Tsunami simulation Buildings  Dynamic analysis  Floods  Flow velocity  Nonlinear analysis  Reinforced concrete  Tsunamis  Analysis methodology  Fragility curves  Push-over analysis  Time history analysis  Tsunami forces  Tsunami simulation  Structural design  computer simulation  concrete structure  dynamic analysis  reinforced concrete  tsunami",Fragility assessment of a RC structure under tsunami actions via nonlinear static and dynamic analyses,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,Analytical
18997,"Multi-hazard analysis of earthquake shaking and tsunami impact Tsunami damage on buildings in regions subjected to shaking is commonly modeled disregarding the occurrence of a previous earthquake and damages that have already occurred at those buildings. In Portugal, there are studies for the regions of Lisboa, Setúbal and Algarve that access damages or vulnerability of buildings due to the action of tsunami waves. Even so, they never took into account that, if near to the epicenter, usually prior to the tsunami, there was an earthquake shaking capable of provoking some level of damages to the building stock in the affected area. In this paper, we propose a way of combining earthquake shaking damages with tsunami damages – the aggregated damage. This is defined as an additive function. The aggregated damage of a building is the sum of damages caused by the earthquake plus those caused by the tsunami. As for earthquake shaking damage assessment, we use a home-developed software model based on standard vulnerability indexes conveying fragility curves for 5 different damage states (DSi), for reinforced concrete and other building typologies (only masonry is considered in the present case). The tsunami fragility curves corresponding to similar DSi, were obtained from recent published literature where the main variable was the water maximum height reaching each building which was estimated using a Geographic Information System (GIS) approach. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd Aggregated damages  Damages  Earthquake  GIS  Simulator  Tsunami None",Multi-hazard analysis of earthquake shaking and tsunami impact,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2911688735733771,0.13165218571530948,0.04946402991674865,0.006513437580721026,Analytical
19784,"Probabilistic seismic damage assessment of rc buildings based on nonlinear dynamic analysis The incremental dynamic analysis is a powerful tool for evaluating the seismic vulnerability and risk of buildings. It allows calculating the global damage of structures for different PGAs and representing this result by means of damage curves. Such curves are used by many methods to obtain seismic risk scenarios at urban level. Even if the use of this method in a probabilistic environment requires a relevant computational effort, it should be the reference method for seismic risk evaluation. In this article we propose to assess the seismic expected damage by using nonlinear dynamic analysis. We will obtain damage curves by means of the incremental dynamic analysis combined with the damage index of Park & Ang. The uncertainties related to the mechanical properties of the materials and the seismic action will be considered. The probabilistic damage curves obtained can be used to calculate not only seismic risk scenarios at urban level, but also to estimate economic losses. © Vargas et al.; Licensee Bentham Open.

18772,"Machine learning-based approaches for seismic demand and collapse of ductile reinforced concrete building frames Robust seismic vulnerability assessment for a building under expected earthquake ground motions necessitates explicit consideration of all-important sources of uncertainty in structural model idealization. This paper presents a machine learning-based methodology for reliably predicting the seismic response and structural collapse classification of ductile reinforced concrete frame buildings under future earthquake events by accounting for component- and system-level modeling uncertainties. The proposed methodology uses two different types of machine learning methods—regression-based and classification-based methods—to achieve the goal of this study. Machine learning techniques with boosting algorithms (i.e., adaptive boosting and extreme gradient boosting) are the best methods for both response prediction and collapse status classification of modern code-compliant reinforced concrete frame buildings. Finally, the effect of uncertain modeling parameters on the response and collapse identification is examined. The reinforced concrete beam modeling-related parameters (i.e., plastic deformation properties) of ductile, low-to mid-rise frame buildings are significant predictors of seismic response due to capacity design principles.

Therefore, this study presented the framework to develop an artificial neural network-based model, which can rapidly predict seismic responses with soil–structure interaction effects and determine the seismic performance levels. To train, validate and test the model, 11 input parameters were selected as main parameters, and the seismic responses with the soil–structure interaction were generated using a multistep analysis process proposed in this study. The artificial neural network model generated reliable seismic responses with the soil–structure interaction effects, and it rapidly extended the seismic response database using a simple structure and soil information.

19286,"On the influence of the main floor layout of buildings in economic flood risk assessment: Results from central Spain Multiple studies have been carried out on the correct estimation of the damages (direct tangible losses) associated with floods. However, the complex analysis and the multitude of variables conditioning the damage estimation, as well as the uncertainty in their estimation, make it difficult, even today, to reach one single, complete solution to this problem. In no case has the influence that the topographic relationship between the main floor of a residential building and the surrounding land have in the estimation of flood economic damage been analysed. To carry out this analysis, up to a total of 28 magnitude-damage functions (with different characteristics and application scales) were selected on which the effect of over-elevation and under-elevation of the main floor of the houses was simulated (at intervals of 20 cm, between-0.6 and +1 m). According to each of the two trends, an overestimation or underestimation of flood damage was observed. This pattern was conditioned by the specific characteristics of each magnitude-damage function, meaning that the percentage of damage became asymptotic from a certain flow depth value. In a real scenario, the consideration of this variable (as opposed to its non-consideration) causes an average variation in the damage estimation around 30%. Based on these results, the analysed variable can be considered as (1) another main source of uncertainty in the correct estimation of flood damage, and (2) an essential variable to take into account in a flood damage analysis for the correct estimation of loss. © 2020 by the authors.

19505,"Performances of FRP reinforcements on masonry buildings evaluated by fragility curves The seismic vulnerability assessment of masonry buildings reinforced with FRP was investigated by means of random sampling of their mechanical properties and repeated nonlinear static analyses. To this aim, the Monte Carlo simulation method was adopted to account for the uncertainty of the mechanical parameters characterizing the analytical model representative of each structural prototype. In particular, a two-step procedure was proposed. First, to ensure an appropriate calibration of the model, was investigated the mechanical behavior of two case-studies structures: an unreinforced masonry panel and a masonry panel externally reinforced with FRP composite strips applied with a grid configuration and anchored properly at their ends. Then, the effectiveness of a FRP reinforcement designed for the main façade of the historical Camponeschi Palace (located in the city of L'Aquila, Italy) was estimated. The proposed methodology was used to determine the probability of occurrence of several damage states and to estimate the relevant probability density functions corresponding to different levels of ground motion.

16281,"Comparison of inundation depth and momentum flux based fragilities for probabilistic tsunami damage assessment and uncertainty analysis Annual exceedance probabilities of the maximum tsunami inundation depth, hMax, and momentum flux, MMax, conditional on a full-rupture event of the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) were used to estimate the probability of building damage using a fragility analysis at Seaside, Oregon. Tax lot data, Google Street View, and field reconnaissance surveys were used to classify the buildings in Seaside and to correlate building typologies with existing fragility curves according to the construction material, number of stories, and building seismic design level based on the date of construction. A fragility analysis was used to estimate the damage probability of buildings for 500-, 1000-, and 2500-year exceedance probabilities conditioned on a full-rupture CSZ event. Finally, the sensitivity of building damage was estimated for both the aleatory and epistemic uncertainties involved in the process of damage estimation. Probable damage estimates from the fragility curves based on hMax and on MMax both generally show higher damage probability for structures that are wooden and closer to the shoreline than those that are reinforced concrete (RC) and further landward of the shoreline. However, a relatively high and somewhat unrealistic damage probability was found at the river and creek region from the fragility curve analysis using hMax. Within 500 m from the shoreline, wood structure damage shows significant sensitivity to the aleatory uncertainty of the tsunami generation from the CSZ event. On the other hand, RC structure damage showed equal sensitivity to the aleatory uncertainty of the tsunami generation as well as the epistemic uncertainties due to the numerical modeling of the tsunami inundation (friction), the building classification (material and date of construction), and the type of fragility curves (depth or momentum flux type curves). Further from the shoreline, the wood structures showed similar aleatory and epistemic uncertainties, qualitatively similar to the RC structure sensitivity closer to the shoreline. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

21406,"Site classes effect on seismic vulnerability evaluation of RC precast industrial buildings Fragility curves are being more significant as a useful tool for evaluating the relationship between the earthquake intensity measure and the effects of the engineering demand parameter on the buildings. In this paper, the effect of different site conditions on the vulnerability of the structures was examined through the fragility curves taking into account different strength capacities of the precast columns. Thus, typical existing single-story precast RC industrial buildings which were built in Turkey after the year 2000 were examined. The fragility curves for the three typical existing industrial structures were derived from an analytical approach by performing non-linear dynamic analyses considering three different soil conditions. The Park and Ang damage index was used in order to determine the damage level of the members. The spectral acceleration (Sa) was used as the ground motion parameter in the fragility curves. The results indicate that the fragility curves were derived for the structures vary depending on the site conditions. The damage probability of exceedance values increased from stiff site to soft site for any Sa value. This difference increases in long period in examined buildings. In addition, earthquake demand values were calculated by considering the buildings and site conditions, and the effect of the site class on the building damage was evaluated by considering the Mean Damage Ratio parameter (MDR). Achieving fragility curves and MDR curves as a function of spectral acceleration enables a quick and practical risk assessment in existing buildings. © 2021 Techno-Press, Ltd.

19737,"Probabilistic Flood Loss Assessment at the Community Scale: Case Study of 2016 Flooding in Lumberton, North Carolina Flood events are one of the most common natural disasters in the United States and can disrupt businesses; strain the financial resources of agencies that respond; and often leave households dislocated for days, months, or permanently. Community resilience planning requires an assessment of the damage and loss caused by a hazard followed by recovery modeling, which couples the socioeconomics with the physical-infrastructure recovery process. This paper focuses on the first part of that analysis chain, namely damage and loss modeling to riverine flooding at the community level, with a case study of Lumberton, North Carolina, using empirical damage fragilities. The process includes the major components toward flood-loss quantification. The losses in the case study are computed from the damage fragilities and compared with the deterministic flood loss analysis in HAZUS-MH, which uses stage-damage functions. For the case study presented in this paper, the fragility-based approach resulted in slightly higher loss estimates. The fragility-based approach presented as part of this study can provide a mechanism to propagate uncertainty in damage and loss estimates. This ability to propagate such uncertainty into the analysis would allow for risk-informed decision making for floods using a similar approach to what is currently done for earthquake and wind community-level loss analyses.

15191,"A methodology for seismic loss estimation in urban regions based on ground-motion simulations Seismic vulnerability assessment of residential buildings in regions of high seismicity is an interdisciplinary problem requiring major inputs from fields of seismology and earthquake engineering. The basic two components of loss estimation methods are information on regional seismicity and building stock. This study presents a realistic loss estimation methodology where the first component, input ground motions, is obtained from regional ground-motion simulations using the stochastic finite-fault technique. The second component, building vulnerability information, on the other hand, is taken into account using fragility analyses. Introducing the ground-motion intensity parameters obtained from simulations to the fragility curves, we obtain seismic loss distribution in a region. In this study, we demonstrate the loss estimation methodology with an application to three northwestern cities in Turkey (Düzce, Bolu, and Kaynaşli{dotless}) that experienced two major earthquakes (Mw 7:4 and Mw 7:1) in less than three months in 1999. We initially verify the methodology with comparisons of observed and estimated damage ratios for the 12 November 1999 (Mw 7:1) Düzce earthquake. Later, we present the estimated damage ratios under scenario earthquakes in the region for a magnitude range of Mw 5:5-7:5. Mw 6:5 is predicted to be the threshold magnitude for the cities of Düzce and Kaynaşli{dotless} where more than 60% of the building stock experience moderate and heavy damage. Because Bolu is at a farther distance from the fault plane, less damage is estimated for Mw 5:5-7:0 than those in the other centers. For Mw 7:5, all three cities are predicted to experience substantial rates of heavy damage and collapse.

The performance of the proposed methodology and the INSPIRE tool were tested against the dataset in Kamala and Patong municipalities, Phuket province, Thailand. The estimated building type ratios from the sampling survey show the satisfactory agreement with the actual building data at the test sites. Sub-area classification by land use can improve the accuracy of the building type ratio estimation. For the resulting loss estimation, the exposure data generated from detailed field survey can provide the agreeable results when comparing to the actual building damage recorded for the Indian Ocean tsunami event in 2004. However, lower accuracy exposure data derived from sampling survey and remote sensing can still provide a comparative overview of estimated loss. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

22307," Seismic fragility curves for winddesigned-buildings in Hong Kong Publisher Summary This chapter presents a simple analytical method to generate seismic fragility curves for low-rise to high-rise buildings in Hong Kong. The seismic vulnerability is assumed proportional to the sectional areas of the column and shear walls of the structure. Three wind-code-designed buildings are selected for the analysis, namely a 6-storey school building by the Architectural Services Department, and a 21- storey residential building at Mei Foo Sun Chuen, and a 40-storey residential building of the Hong Kong Housing Authority. Instead of using intensity, seismic hazard is prescribed in terms of peak ground acceleration. The adopted response spectra are site-dependent and depend on whether the design earthquakes are near field or far field. The seismic responses of buildings are analyzed using the equivalent static force approach for multi-degree-of-freedom-oscillators, expressed in terms of the fundamental site period and epicentral distances. The ductility distribution of buildings is then formulated as a lognormal distribution. Finally, the vulnerability of the structure is given as fragility curves. The results indicate that damage probability is highly sensitive to the number of storey or building height, structural scheming, and functional usage of the buildings and other parameters such as site condition and epicentral distance are equally crucial to the structural seismic vulnerability.

12802,"Development of probabilistic cost function for flood damage to residential structures Risk models, which describe the relationship between hazard intensity and a damage ratio are Increasingly used in flood risk management. Direct tangible damage resulting from flooding is typically computed based on the internationally accepted method of depth-damage curves. Depth-damage curves relate absolute damage (in terms of currency) or relative loss (percentage of the estimated total replacement value of property) to a given flood depth. Many depth-damage functions in use today are computed from synthetic data, where data are collected from a representative sample of buildings with similar properties in a floodplain during field surveys. A primary problem when assessing risk at an object-based spatial resolution using depth-damage curves is that these damage functions represent an average structure in the study location. There Is great variability across any given structural class as well as variation within individual structures in a structural category (and across communities), for example, not all one-storey residences with basements are the same size, nor constructed of the same quality of materials and workmanship. The variability within a given class of buildings and the resulting depth-damage curve are often not transparent to the end user, thus damage estimates for individual buildings may be over/under estimated. In this paper, synthetic depth-damage curve data from communities in southern Ontario are used to develop probabilistic cost functions such that monetary damage estimates, as spent in Canadian dollars, and their likelihood of being exceeded at any given flood depth are more clearly expressed and communicated to end users. © 6th International Disaster Mitigation Specialty Conference 2018, Held as Part of the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering Annual Conference 2018.

In this paper, an evaluation of the seismic fragility relationships for reinforced concrete (RC) frame systems prone to mainshock-aftershocks sequences is conducted. Fiber-based finite element models for different types of RC frames are established and subjected to a suite of ground motions obtained from the Tohoku sequence.

17863,"Flood risk modelling based on tangible and intangible urban flood damage quantification The usual way to quantify flood damage is by application stage-damage functions. Urban flood incidents in flat areas mostly result in intangible damages like traffic disturbance and inconvenience for pedestrians caused by pools at building entrances, on sidewalks and parking spaces. Stage-damage functions are not well suited to quantify damage for these floods. This paper presents an alternative method to quantify flood damage that uses data from a municipal call centre. The data cover a period of 10 years and contain detailed information on consequences of urban flood incidents. Call data are linked to individual flood incidents and then assigned to specific damage classes. The results are used to draw risk curves for a range of flood incidents of increasing damage severity. Risk curves for aggregated groups of damage classes show that total flood risk related to traffic disturbance is larger than risk of damage to private properties, which in turn is larger than flood risk related to human health. Risk curves for detailed damage classes show how distinctions can be made between flood risks related to many types of occupational use in urban areas. This information can be used to support prioritisation of actions for flood risk reduction. Since call data directly convey how citizens are affected by urban flood incidents, they provide valuable information that complements flood risk analysis based on hydraulic models. © IWA Publishing 2010.

15260,"A novel contribution for resilient buildings. Theoretical fragility curves: Interaction between energy and structural behavior for reinforced concrete buildings The paper introduces a new semi‐probabilistic methodology for the definition of energy fragility curves suitable for a macro‐classification of building stock inspired to and coupled with the widely adopted method of seismic fragility curves. The approach is applied to the reinforced concrete residential buildings of the Italian stock. Starting from a classification according to the climatic zone and the construction period, some reference buildings in terms of building envelope typologies have been defined and simulated by means of dynamic modeling tools. Then, cumulative distributions of the probability that the primary energy consumption for heating was comparable with certain threshold values are defined according to the climatic conditions expressed with the heating degree days, which constitute the intensity measure for the fragility curves. Finally, by focusing on the interaction points between structural and energetic aspects, it is shown how these curves can be useful for decision‐makers with regards to definition of importance and or the level of intervention to be made to the building envelope for improving its seismic safety and the energy quality. Indeed, non‐integrated interventions are more expensive and less efficient. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

18358,"Impact on loss/risk assessments of inter-model variability in vulnerability analysis Fragility curves (FCs) constitute an emerging tool for the seismic risk assessment of all elements at risk. They express the probability of a structure being damaged beyond a specific damage state for a given seismic input motion parameter, incorporating the most important sources of uncertainties, that is, seismic demand, capacity and definition of damage states. Nevertheless, the implementation of FCs in loss/risk assessments introduces other important sources of uncertainty, related to the usually limited knowledge about the elements at risk (e.g., inventory, typology). In this paper, within a Bayesian framework, it is developed a general methodology to combine into a single model (Bayesian combined model, BCM) the information provided by multiple FC models, weighting them according to their credibility/applicability, and independent past data. This combination enables to efficiently capture inter-model variability (IMV) and to propagate it into risk/loss assessments, allowing the treatment of a large spectrum of vulnerability-related uncertainties, usually neglected. As case study, FCs for shallow tunnels in alluvial deposits, when subjected to transversal seismic loading, are developed with two conventional procedures, based on a quasi-static numerical approach. Noteworthy, loss/risk assessments resulting from such conventional methods show significant unexpected differences. Conventional fragilities are then combined in a Bayesian framework, in which also probability values are treated as random variables, characterized by their probability density functions. The results show that BCM efficiently projects the whole variability of input models into risk/loss estimations. This demonstrates that BCM is a suitable framework to treat IMV in vulnerability assessments, in a straightforward and explicit manner.

21109,"Seismic vulnerability assessment for pre cincts of unreinforced masonry buildings in New Zealand and Australia The nature of urban development in New Zealand and Australia followed a similar pattern, with communities frequently having a high density of unreinforceed masonry (URM) buildings at their civic centre due to the early colonial practice of repeating the style of building architecture that was fashionable in the United Kingdom during the mmid and late 1800s when the two countries experienced European colonisation. Following the 2010/2011 Canterbury earthquakes approximately 90% of the unreinforced masonry buildings that had been prevalent throughout the Christchurchh Central Business District were demolished, either because of severe building damage or beecause their cost of repair was excessive with respect to the insurance cover and the price of a new replacement building. This outcome has led to a complete change of character to the city, with very few historic buildings now remaining. These events have also underscored that similar scenarios can be expected throughout New Zealand and Australia if future earthquakes were to generate high intensity ground shaking to these URM precincts. In response to the above issues, a joint NZ-Australia research project was undertaken to investigate appropriate ground shaking scenarios and survey specially selected URM precincts. These surveys accounted for URM building construction characteristics that would influence their expected earthquake response. Pedestrian and building occupancy data were also estimated. Using empirical data from the Canterbury earthquakes, building fragility functions, volume-loss models, falling debris relationships, and correlated casualty relationships were developed. These relationships were then applied to the earthquake scenaarios to understand the likely impacts in terms of building performance and damage, the extent of casualties, impacts on cordoning decision and economic disruption, plus the benefits to be derived from a pro-active approach to seismic retrofit implementation. © 2018 The International Masonry Society (IMS).

Internationally, various damage models exist to quantify the structural damage to the structure and the resulting losses due to seismic action. The application of the different types of damage functions for a realistic assessment of damage requires a detailed knowledge of the structure and its vulnerability and site-specific conditions. The intensity-based damage model for general building stock, developed at the Earthquake Damage Analysis Center of the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar within the framework of the German Research Network Natural Disasters (DFNK), was validated on the mean damage grades Dm and the reported losses of the 1978 Albstadt earthquake. A consideration of the spreads and uncertainties in the distribution of damage grades Di as well as the mirroring of comparable damage models was still pending. The validation and evaluation of the investigated model approaches is carried out in the paper on the basis of the distribution of the actually occurred structural damages of the seismic events characterized by different site intensities (e.g. Albstadt 1978, L'Aquila 2009). Looking back at the study of DFNK, the results for the metropolitan area of Cologne will be examined again with new building data and the extended damage model. The building vulnerability, aggregated in the DFNK, is transferred to the individual building stock and the influence on the earthquake scenarios is examined. The scatter of structural damage and losses are taken into account by Monte Carlo simulations. The changes in the results compared to the DFNK study are identified and discussed. © 2020, Ernst und Sohn.

17430,"Estimation of an absolute flood damage curve based on an Austrian case study under a dam breach scenario To date, in Austria no empirical assessment of absolute damage curves has been realized on the basis of detailed information on flooded buildings due to a dam breach, presumably because of the lack of data. This paper tries to fill this gap by estimating an absolute flood-damage curve, based on data of a recent flood event in Austria in 2006. First, a concise analysis of the case study area is conducted, i.e., the maximum damage potential is identified by using raster-based GIS. Thereafter, previous literature findings on existing flood-damage functions are considered in order to determine a volume-water damage function that can be used for further flood damage assessment. Finally, the flood damage function is cross validated and applied in prediction of damage potential in the study area. For future development of the estimated flood damage curve, and to aid more general use, we propose verification against field data on damage caused by natural waves in rivers. © Author(s) 2010.

19271,"Observed seismic vulnerability of Italian buildings A very large database of post-earthquake building inspections carried out after the main Italian events of the last 30 years has been processed in order to derive fragility curves for 23 building typologies, mostly referring to masonry structures. The records (more than 91000) of this very complete and homogeneous dataset have been converted into a single damage scale with five levels of damage, plus the case of no damage. For each affected municipality a value of PGA and Housner Intensity (In) has been evaluated using attenuation laws. Damage probability matrices have been then extracted. These experimental data have been fitted through lognormal fragility curves using an advanced nonlinear regression algorithm also taking into account the relative reliability of each point by the bootstrap technique. The significant concentration of experimental data at low levels of ground motion, associated to the selected analytical expression, determine the peculiar shape of some-of the curves, with a very steep initial branch followed by an almost horizontal curve for increasing values of ground motion.

16665,"Damage models for extreme flood events - Part 1: Modeling and validation based on the 2002 flood The actual 2013 flood events illustrate the importance of the flood protection measures planned and partly already implemented after the 2002 flood. The economic evaluation of these measures in the context of cost-benefit analysis show the demand for development of new resilient damage functions for each usage class. Conventional loss models are limited to the relationship between flood height and the comprehensible cost from the insurance side for a specific usage class (like e. g. private residential buildings). On the one hand the required differentiation according to the parameters on the resistance side is still missing and on the other hand further impact parameters like flow velocity remain unconsidered. Based on the experiences in the earthquake hazard assessment a vulnerability and engineering based flood damage model was developed in different research projects at the Earthquake Damage Analysis Center (EDAC) at the Bauhaus-Universitat Weimar. The provided vulnerability functions describe the relationship between flood height, flow velocity and the damage grades D-i taking into account the building vulnerability. As well newly developed damage functions transfer these parameters into concrete loss statements. Based on the extensive evaluation of damage data, the flood damage model has been improved in recent years and new vulnerability- and damage functions were implemented. The paper gives again an overview of the elements of the model and introduces the new functions. The functions are validated on the 2002 flood event taken into account improved data bases.

13564,"Tsunami loss assessment based on Hazus approach - The Bat Galim, Israel, case study The extensive loss of human lives and building damage sustained during past tsunamis drove development of the first tsunami risk assessment in Israel. Although past tsunamis have occurred along the eastern Mediterranean coasts, no data is available for empirical hazard and risk analysis. Thus, our assessment focused on a simulated tsunami generated by an Mw 8.2 earthquake along the eastern Cypriot Arc (about 200 km NW of Haifa) in Bat Galim, the most vulnerable neighborhood in the city of Haifa, situated along the Mediterranean coast in northern Israel. This tsunami event represents the worst-case scenario threatening Bat Galim. Exposure data were taken from the National Archives of the Survey of Israel and was verified with a field survey. Two approaches were taken to derive the most appropriate vulnerability models for the study: first, already published Damage Criteria (DC) were developed based on information from past tsunami events around the world; second, damage functions were applied using the Hazus Tsunami Model (HTM), a multi-parameter loss estimation tool built using detailed engineering knowledge. Risk was considered the product of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. Following several parametric studies and sensitivity tests, we produced loss assessment results from the two most realistic model outcomes and arrived at conclusions meaningful for tsunami preparedness in northern Israel. Most importantly, we note that the loss of life far surpasses building damage. Increasing community preparedness is the simplest and most cost-effective way to significantly reduce the risk of casualties during a tsunami. We also note that upgrading the seismic design of existing structures according to required standards in Israel will decrease vulnerability to tsunamis and expand possibilities for vertical evacuation. We discuss the accuracy and reliability of our analysis and demonstrate that a simple DC approach is useful for preliminary investigation in cases of limited data. The HTM however, requires detailed preparation and data inputs but produces more realistic loss estimates. These insights may aid others during future implementation of tsunami loss modeling in threatened coastal communities.

20560,"SEISMIC FRAGILITY ANALYSIS OF IMPROVED RC FRAMES USING DIFFERENT TYPES OF BRACING Application of bracings to increase the lateral stiffness of building structures is a technique of seismic improvement that engineers frequently have recourse to. Accordingly, investigating the role of bracings in concrete structures along with the development of seismic fragility curves are of overriding concern to civil engineers. In this research, an ordinary RC building, designed according to the 1st edition of Iranian seismic code, was selected for examination. According to FEMA 356 code, this building is considered to be vulnerable. To improve the seismic performance of this building, 3 different types of bracings, which are Concentrically Braced Frames, Eccentrically Braced Frames and Buckling Restrained Frames were employed, and each bracing element was distributed in 3 different locations in the building.

13366,"Seismic fragility assessment of reinforced concrete high-rise buildings using the uncoupled modal response history analysis (UMRHA) In this study, a simplified approach for the analytical development of fragility curves of high-rise RC buildings is presented. It is based on an approximate modal decomposition procedure known as the Uncoupled Modal Response History Analysis (UMRHA). Using an example of a 55-story case study building, the fragility relationships are developed using the presented approach. Fifteen earthquake ground motions (categorized into 3 groups corresponding to combinations of small or large magnitude and source-to-site distances) are considered for this example. These ground motion histories are scaled for 3 intensity measures (peak ground acceleration, spectral acceleration at 0.2 s and spectral acceleration at 1 s) varying from 0.25 to 2 g.

An extensive survey was conducted by the Christchurch City Council and the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority following the earthquakes to document damaged buildings in the affected area. The collected data were then merged into the Canterbury Earthquake Building Assessment (CEBA) database, and the database was utilised to assess the damage sustained by RCFMI buildings. In order to provide a reliable estimation of the seismic vulnerability for RCFMI buildings in the region, empirical fragility curves were generated using the Lognormal Cumulative Distribution method by utilising the post-earthquake dataset provided in the CEBA database, with the expected median and standard deviation values derived using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation method. Results showed that the majority of low-rise to mid-rise RCFMI buildings performed satisfactorily during the Canterbury earthquakes, with several high-rise RCFMI buildings sustaining moderate to heavy damage. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

12601,"Analytically Derived Fragility Curves and Damage Assessment of Masonrybuildings The latest earthquake disasters have highlighted, once again, poor functioning of the existing masonry structures, and the need to intervene all these structures which have been designed with old regulatory criteria, inadequate or those that have been built before the emergence of design codes. The significant progress made in new criteria of earthquake resistant design, should be extended to all the existing structures, it is therefore essential to identify the degree of seismic performance. Unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings represent a significant portion of the residential structures in Algeria, accounting for more than 60% of existing buildings. In addition to significant population, the brittle nature of URM buildings further supports a thorough consideration of seismic response given the susceptibility to severe failure modes. Currently, there is a pressing need for analytically based fragility curves for URM buildings. In order to improve the estimation of damage state probabilities through the development of simulation-based masonry fragilities, an extensive literature survey is conducted on pushover analysis of URM structures. Structural response is evaluated using an advanced capacity spectrum method. Capacity, demand, and response are thus derived analytically and response data is used to generate an improved and uniform set of fragility curves for use in risk assessment. Seismic fragility curves are expressed in multiple forms for wide range of use in loss-assessment applications. Results are discussed and compared with other relationships developed in the literature. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.

16622,"DAMAGE CHARACTERISTIC AND FIELD SURVEY OF THE 2011 GREAT EAST JAPAN TSUNAMI IN MIYAGI PREFECTURE On March 11th, 2011, the Pacific coast of Japan was hit by a tsunami generated by the largest earthquake (M9.0) in the history of the country and causing a wide range of devastating damage. Using preliminary reported data from many sources, some topics such as tsunami fatality ratio and tsunami fragility curves for structural damage are discussed and compared with other countries. This paper aims to discuss the damage characteristics of this tsunami as well as its mechanism, as observed through field surveys conducted over the 4 months following the tsunami. The field survey covers 13 areas in the Miyagi prefecture from Kesennuma city in the northernmost region to Yamamoto town in the southernmost region. The arrival time of the first tsunami along the coastal areas in the Miyagi prefecture was confirmed by stopped clocks found during the survey. The damage mechanism of coastal structures such as breakwaters, seawalls, tsunami gates, and evacuation buildings was investigated and discussed. Damage characteristics for each area, i.e., urban areas, port, coastal structures, fisheries, and agricultural areas, were also summarized. The conclusions drawn from the data analysis suggest that experience and education (soft countermeasures) are important to reduce the loss of life, as shown for example in the Sanriku area. The field surveys indicate that wood and reinforced-concrete (RC) structures should be balanced to survive both earthquake and tsunami forces, and the structural design for buildings should be reconsidered after the example in Onagawa town. In addition, coastal structures for tsunami countermeasures (hard countermeasures) should be more properly designed for survival instead of becoming floating debris upon being overturned by a tsunami. The combination of both hard and soft measures is especially necessary for optimizing the outcomes following a great disaster. These recommendations should be taken into consideration in the reconstruction efforts for better tsunami countermeasures in the future.

18837,"Mechanism based assessment of damaged building's residual capacity Seismic behavior of damaged buildings may be expressed as a function of their RE-sidual Capacity (REC). The residual capacity RECSa is defined as the minimum spectral acceleration (at the period Teq of the equivalent SDOF) corresponding to building collapse. When referring to peak ground acceleration ag as damaging intensity parameter, REC ag is defined as the minimum anchoring peak ground acceleration such as to determine building collapse. For a given spectral shape, RECag corresponds to RECSa scaled by the spectral amplification factor for Teq. RECSa and RECag, generally indicated as REC, lower with increasing damage level in buildings; hence REC may be very useful in estimating the post-seismic building safety. In a recent work [1] it has been shown how it is possible to derive REC (RECSa and RECag) through Pushover Analyses (PA), where a suitable modification of plastic hinges for damaged elements is applied. The applicability of PA for damaged structures is verified in [2] by comparison of the PA results with those on nonlinear time-history analyses. On the other hand, it is unrealistic that in the aftermath of an earthquake, when the assessment of building safety has to be performed in an emergency situation, there would be time for the execution of detailed nonlinear analyses. Acknowledging the need for easier and faster evaluation tools, in [3] a simplified MEChanism based method (MEC) for evaluating the building REC was preliminary tested. The present work extends the comparison of the results (in terms of REC), that could be obtained by PA and MEC analyses, considering a number of Reinforced Concrete (RC) frames building typologies. Moreover, by adopting the MEC approach, the possible variation of REC as a function of seismic demand is investigated. The simplified method can be used to explore the possible ranges of REC variation for RC building classes considering the anticipated mechanism formation after an earthquake; in addition, it could be used in the post-seismic phase for estimating the REC of damaged buildings having undergone identifiable plastic mechanisms and for fast assessment of damage-dependent collapse fragility curves.

16952,"Development of vulnerability curves of buildings to windstorms using insurance data: An empirical study in South Korea Windstorms have caused a range of damage on the built environment. Although several risk assessment models for estimating such damage have been widely developed, the results generated by these models often turn inaccurate due to the building information required for such models at a regional scale are usually incomplete, or of a poor quality. Alternatively, this study utilizes an insurance company's loss data pertaining to the high winds of Typhoon Maemi in South Korea in 2003 for calculating building damage in terms of damage ratios. Next, these damage ratios and storm-wind speeds are utilized for constructing vulnerability curves that can be used to predict levels of damage to designated building types subject to given wind speeds. Lastly, geographical information systems spatial data is combined with those vulnerability curves to arrive at four distinct wind-damage levels. It is hoped that the present research will serve as a reference for further studies of developing building vulnerability curves for storm winds.

20200,"Role of design level and infill arrangement on the seismic fragility curves of Italian RC existing buildings Assessing the seismic vulnerability of existing buildings is a fundamental step in order to define mitigation programs in prone earthquake areas. In Italy, in 2019 the National Department of Civil Protection supported an ongoing research project involving its “Center of Competence” on seismic risk, ReLUIS (Network of University Laboratories for Earthquake Engineering), with the cooperation of Eucentre (European Centre for Training and Research in Earthquake Engineering) to update the 2018 version of the National Risk Assessment. In this context, new fragility curves are being derived by using different approaches, whose results will be properly combined. In the paper, the purposely set up methodology for deriving analytical fragility curves through Non-Linear Dynamic Analyses (NLDAs) has been described.

19820,"Probabilistic, Multivariable Flood Loss Modeling on the Mesoscale with BT-FLEMO Flood loss modeling is an important component for risk analyses and decision support in flood risk management. Commonly, flood loss models describe complex damaging processes by simple, deterministic approaches like depth-damage functions and are associated with large uncertainty. To improve flood loss estimation and to provide quantitative information about the uncertainty associated with loss modeling, a probabilistic, multivariable Bagging decision Tree Flood Loss Estimation MOdel (BT-FLEMO) for residential buildings was developed. The application of BT-FLEMO provides a probability distribution of estimated losses to residential buildings per municipality. BT-FLEMO was applied and validated at the mesoscale in 19 municipalities that were affected during the 2002 flood by the River Mulde in Saxony, Germany. Validation was undertaken on the one hand via a comparison with six deterministic loss models, including both depth-damage functions and multivariable models. On the other hand, the results were compared with official loss data. BT-FLEMO outperforms deterministic, univariable, and multivariable models with regard to model accuracy, although the prediction uncertainty remains high. An important advantage of BT-FLEMO is the quantification of prediction uncertainty. The probability distribution of loss estimates by BT-FLEMO well represents the variation range of loss estimates of the other models in the case study. © 2016 Society for Risk Analysis Damage modeling  multiparameter  probabilistic  uncertainty  validation Buildings  Decision support systems  Decision trees  Flood control  Flood damage  Housing  Pitting  Probability distributions  Reactor cores  Risk analysis  Risk management  Uncertainty analysis  Damage model  Multiparameters  Probabilistic  Uncertainty  Validation  Floods  decision analysis  flood  model validation  multivariate analysis  probability  residential development  uncertainty analysis  Germany  Saxony  article  decision tree  Germany  prediction  probability  quantitative analysis  river  sensitivity analysis  uncertainty","Probabilistic, Multivariable Flood Loss Modeling on the Mesoscale with BT-FLEMO",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06267051310144021,0.19933734628432503,0.01974939157783783,0.03059316514992685,Empirical
16770,"Derivation of tsunami damage curves from fragility functions Structural vulnerability due to tsunami loading can be characterized by a family of fragility curves, which are expressed as lognormal cumulative distributions of the conditional probabilities of reaching or exceeding various damage states for given values of the demand parameter, generally inundation depth. Such curves can easily be obtained from field surveys. However, what is required for risk analyses is total damage. This research presents a method of obtaining mean damage curves from fragility functions in the literature, using cost coefficients associated with each of four damage states. The curves are obtained for timber, masonry and reinforced concrete single-storey structures. They could also be fitted very well with negative power law expressions having two parameters, and quite well with negative exponential functions having just a single parameter (based on construction material) and the single independent variable of inundation depth. The damage curves can also be used to present the relative vulnerability of one construction material with respect to another; this could reduce the variability associated with different locations. The relative damage ratios for the different construction materials were found to be strongly dependent on inundation depth. Although there are large differences among construction materials at low depths, such differences disappear at depths of 6-10m. Similarly, the effects of shielding and debris on damage were also found to be dependent on inundation depth. The results of this work can be used to introduce coupling effects into empirical relative vulnerability models that seek to incorporate many factors independently.

16004,"Building damage characteristics based on surveyed data and fragility curves of the 2011 Great East Japan tsunami A large amount of buildings was damaged or destroyed by the 2011 Great East Japan tsunami. Numerous field surveys were conducted in order to collect the tsunami inundation extents and building damage data in the affected areas. Therefore, this event provides us with one of the most complete data set among tsunami events in history. In this study, fragility functions are derived using data provided by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transportation of Japan, with more than 250,000 structures surveyed. The set of data has details on damage level, structural material, number of stories per building and location (town). This information is crucial to the understanding of the causes of building damage, as differences in structural characteristics and building location can be taken into account in the damage probability analysis. Using least squares regression, different sets of fragility curves are derived to demonstrate the influence of structural material, number of stories and coastal topography on building damage levels. The results show a better resistant performance of reinforced concrete and steel buildings over wood or masonry buildings. Also, buildings taller than two stories were confirmed to be much stronger than the buildings of one or two stories. The damage characteristic due to the coastal topography based on limited number of data in town locations is also shortly discussed here. At the same tsunami inundation depth, buildings along the Sanriku ria coast were much greater damaged than buildings from the plain coast in Sendai. The difference in damage states can be explained by the faster flow velocities in the ria coast at the same inundation depth. These findings are key to support better future building damage assessments, land use management and disaster planning. © 2012 The Author(s).

19711,"Probabilistic demand models and fragilities for reinforced concrete frame structures subject to mainshock-aftershock sequences This paper presents a formulation for developing seismic demand models and estimating fragilities for reinforced concrete (RC) structures under mainshocks (MSs) only and mainshock-aftershock (MS-AS) sequences. The demand model for the MS only is a function of the MS intensity, while the model for the MS-AS sequence is a function of two variables, one describing the MS and one describing the AS. A Bayesian method is used to calibrate the demand models. The demand models are then used to estimate the fragility of RC structures. Predictive fragility curves are developed to include the uncertainties in the model parameters estimated by Bayesian approach, and confidence bounds of the fragility curves are developed to separate the effects of the uncertainty in the model parameters from the other sources of uncertainties. The proposed formulation is illustrated using a typical five-story RC frame building. The results show that the fragility curves for MS only tend to significantly underestimate the fragility curves for MS-AS sequences. Also, the uncertainty in the fragilities for the MS-AS sequence is, as expected, larger than that considering only the MS. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd Bayesian updating  Mainshock-aftershock impacts  Probabilistic modeling  Seismic damage evaluation  Structural reliability Bayesian networks  Reinforced concrete  Uncertainty analysis  Aftershock sequence  Bayesian updating  Demand models  Fragility curves  Mainshock  Mainshock-aftershock impact  Probabilistic modeling  Seismic damage evaluation  Structural reliability  Uncertainty  Earthquakes  aftershock  Bayesian analysis  multistorey building  numerical model  probability  reinforced concrete  reliability analysis  seismic response  structural response",Probabilistic demand models and fragilities for reinforced concrete frame structures subject to mainshock-aftershock sequences,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1517511988773664,0.06352084376228838,0.02215259118869137,0.16554279132873828,ML
12681,"Characterization of Coastal Flood Damage States for Residential Buildings Risk management programs and catastrophe models use fragility and vulnerability curves extensively. For the case of coastal flood events, the independent variable for these damage functions is usually the inundation depth, sometimes combined with some expression of water velocity or wave action. Postdisaster surveys often provide the basis for these damage functions, where the investigators classify the observed damage into broad categories based on qualitative descriptions. This paper describes a method to transform these qualitative evaluations into quantitative descriptions of damage states, which are then applied to develop fragility and vulnerability curves. The authors present this process within the context of the development of coastal flood fragility and vulnerability functions for the Florida Public Hurricane Loss Model. The model characterizes and quantifies the damage states specific to a set of fragility curves by using damage distributions and component cost analysis and transforms the fragility curves into a vulnerability curve. The paper analyzes the uncertainties in the model due to the number and quantification of the damage states and an adjustment function included in the discretization process. The analysis shows that the number of damage states governs the overall uncertainty. Model outputs are compared with USACE expert opinion depth-damage functions to validate the model and identify aspects for further refinement. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

12795,"Development of Fragility Curve of Reinforced Concrete Buildings with Different Height Based on Dynamic Analysis This study aims to develop the fragility curve of reinforced concrete buildings with different height based on dynamic analysis. There are 4 models of the moment-resisting concrete frame (MRCF) were used, which are 10, 15, 20, and 25-storey. Each of these frames was designed based on Eurocode 2. The SAP2000 program was used as the main analysis tool to obtain the limit state of MRCF. Then, an incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) was carried out with 7 ground motion records obtained from the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center (PEER). The IDA curves were compared with the limit state of the MRCF, which is maximum allowable drift. The calculation of maximum allowable drift is based on the formula from the International Building Code (IBC, 2003). From the IDA results, 10-storey MRCF has better structural performance under the same ground motion as compared to other MRCF (10, 15, 20, and 25-storey). Fragility curves were developed by considering the results of IDA as parameters. Based on the results of the fragility curve, the MRCF that has the highest probability of exceeding the limit state is 25-storey MRCF. This is because 25-storey MRCF has the lowest PGA at 100% probability. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

20801,"Seismic performance assessment of masonry infill reinforced concrete buildings in Eastern Canada In Eastern Canada, most of moment resisting reinforced concrete frames with unreinforced masonry infill (MI-MRF) buildings were constructed between 1915 and 1960. These pre-code structures, in terms of seismic requirements, are considered vulnerable to earthquake due to insufficient ductility and resistance. The goal of this study is to provide a quantitative assessment of their seismic performance using fragility functions. Fragility functions represent the probability of damage that corresponds to a specific seismic intensity measure (e.g. peak ground acceleration at the site). Based on a structural characterisation study on existing buildings in Québec region, a case study three storey-three bay MI-MRF was selected as representative for mid-rise buildings. Pushover analyses were conducted on a nonlinear model of the infill frame to obtain the corresponding lateral load-deformation capacity curve. The nonlinear behaviour of the reinforced concrete beams and columns was modelled with concentrated plastic hinges at members' ends and a modified strut-and-tie model was used for the infill to account for multiple failure modes. A simplified probabilistic nonlinear static procedure was applied to obtain the seismic demand model at increasing levels of seismic intensity. Fragility functions were then developed using an experiment-based damage model that correlate the extent of damage to the displacement demand. Damage assessment using the developed functions was conducted for an earthquake scenario compatible with the design-level seismic hazard in Quebec City with a 2% and 10% probability of exceedance in 50 years. The developed functions and methodology are particularly useful in probability-based seismic loss assessment and in planning mitigation solutions. © 2014 © 2014 The Institution of Engineers, Singapore. damage estimation  fragility analysis  nonlinear static analyses  reinforced concrete frames  unreinforced masonry infills Beams and girders  Damage detection  Earthquake resistance  Probability  Reinforced concrete  Seismic design  Seismic waves  Static analysis  Structural frames  Damage estimation  Fragility analysis  Non-linear static analysis  Reinforced concrete frames  Unreinforced masonry  Earthquakes",Seismic performance assessment of masonry infill reinforced concrete buildings in Eastern Canada,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8193635674171366,0.033854376381107776,0.02604252647895564,0.004572089599100445,Analytical
20577,"Seismic fragility analysis of RC frame-shear wall structure under multidimensional performance limit state based on ensemble neural network An improved seismic fragility analysis method without any assumption on the distribution of the target engineering demand parameter is proposed based on an ensemble neural network. Firstly, a multidimensional performance limit state function is introduced to evaluate both the structural and non-structural performance. Next, an ensemble neural network, which is defined as a weighted average of three artificial neural networks, is trained to predict the index of the structure subjected to any seismic ground motion. A new index derived from the multidimensional performance limit state function is defined as the neural network output. Finally, the fragility curves are obtained by means of Monte Carlo simulation with high computational efficiency with the help of the ensemble neural network. It is applied to a reinforced concrete frame-shear wall structure, and the maximum inter-story drift ratio and the peak floor acceleration are selected as two engineering demand parameters. The results indicate that, the prediction accuracy of the ensemble neural network is higher than other three neural networks. If only a single neural network is used, the obtained fragility curves may have much error. Compared to the traditional multidimensional probabilistic seismic demand model based on the lognormal distribution assumption, the proposed method can give more credible seismic fragility curves.

18003,"Fragility curves for concrete frame buildings with passive controllers Fragility curves present the probability of a structure exceeding a certain limit state in terms of a seismic intensity parameter function. The seismic demand varies from very low to maximum intensity. The fragility curves are developed from the adjustment of the function distribution of the results obtained. This article presents a set of fragility curves for concrete frame buildings of mid rise and high rise elevations based on the HAZUS classification in order to obtain the level of damage of a structure. The frames have the principal characteristic of having installed passive controllers of variable orifice in each level. Different dampers configurations were considered in the analysis, such as Diagonal, Chevron, Lower Toggle, among others. To develop the fragility curves the maximum drift of the top floor was obtained for each frame based on a nonlinear time history analysis using records of four earthquakes, i.e., El Centro, San Fernando, Loma Prieta, and an earthquake artificially generated. The earthquakes used were escalated from 0.1g to 1.5g with of an increase of 0.1g based on their maximum PGA. To simulate the nonlinearity of the structure the Bouc-Wen model was used.

A total of 7429 buildings were severely damaged or collapsed. Unreinforced masonry buildings still represent a significant part of the residential building stock in rural surroundings of the Eastern Anatolia region. Unfortunately, most of the masonry buildings near to epicenter were found to have collapsed or suffered severe damage. This study provides an evolution of seismological characteristics of the earthquake, including recorded accelerograms and acceleration response spectra. Case studies of damaged masonry buildings and failure or collapse mechanisms are also examined.

A large number of pushover and time history analyses are deployed under a set of 100 strong ground motion records. Fragility curves are generated based on the analysis results for each of the typical buildings. Peak ground velocity (PGV) is selected as the measure of seismic intensity. From the generated sets of the fragility curves, it is observed that damage probabilities are significantly affected by the concrete and detailing quality. Using the constructed fragility curves, collapse probabilities of existing public buildings were estimated according to PGV values. The estimated damage by fragility analyses is compared with past studies related to RC buildings in the region. Hence, analytical fragility curves developed in this study can increase the effectiveness of seismic assessment of essential health care facilities with template designs in the Turkey region. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

12572,"An Efficient Methodology to Estimate Probabilistic Seismic Damage Curves The incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) is a powerful methodology that can be easily extended for calculating probabilistic seismic damage curves. These curves are metadata to assess the seismic risk of structures. Although this methodology requires a relevant computational effort, it should be the reference to correctly estimate the seismic risk of structures. Nevertheless, it would be of high practical interest to have a simpler methodology, based for instance on the pushover analysis (PA), to obtain similar results to those based on IDA. In this article, PA is used to obtain probabilistic seismic damage curves from the stiffness degradation and the energy of the nonlinear part of the capacity curve. A fully probabilistic methodology is tackled by means of Monte Carlo simulations with the purpose of establishing that the results based on the simplified proposed approach are compatible with those obtained with the IDA. Comparisons between the results of both approaches are included for a low- to midrise reinforced concrete building. The proposed methodology significantly reduces the computational effort when calculating probabilistic seismic damage curves. (C) 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

16252,"Comparative non-structural vulnerability assessment methods for historical residential masonry buildings The determination of seismic risk is the foundation for risk mitigation decision-making and a key step in risk management. Large corporations and other enterprises (e.g., local governments) analyze their 'portfolio' of properties, to determine how to best allocate limited funds for structural strengthening of buildings, or other risk reduction measures such as emergency planning. When assessing the seismic vulnerability of buildings, it is essential to first establish the project objectives, before subsequently choosing the most appropriate strategy and tools necessary for building assessment and fulfillment of these objectives. It is also extremely important to understand the difference between the detailed approaches used for individual building assessment and those methods most efficient for larger scale analysis, pursued for city center assessment. While the latter results can be used as a general measure of seismic risk for different types of buildings, the actual seismic risk for any individual building may vary considerably and will depend upon its exact configuration and condition. In this study, some historical masonry buildings located in Alsace France are considered and the dynamic characteristics of these structures were estimated by the analysis of seismic noise recordings by sensors installed at each floor of the buildings under study. The estimated dynamic properties for small amplitude vibrations of these historical structures were used to derive fragility curves through vulnerability models with different level of complexity and accuracy. These fragility curves have been calculated using incremental dynamic analysis for the seismic demands generally imposed upon linear and slightly nonlinear models of single and multiple degrees of freedom, which is the case for the effects of induced seismicity. Considering the latter case of induced seismicity, the vulnerability assessment requires the expected damage to refer to non-structural components. The conclusions through comparison of the results of this study in terms of refinement of the verified structural models will prove useful for both local end-users and industrial stakeholders, with a clear perspective for a better understanding of the risk related to induced and triggered seismicity and its sound management. © 2021 COMPDYN Proceedings.

22077,"Understanding flood risk in the context of community resilience modeling for the built environment: research needs and trends Floods can be devastating to communities and result in fatalities and injuries, negatively impacting the economy, and quality of life. This paper presents a review of community resilience research with a focus on flood hazard including recent advances in flood risk quantification methods and trends to integrate socio-economic factors. The focus of this review was placed on flood risk components including hazard, exposure, and vulnerability to move the current research from deterministic to probabilistic approaches in order to propagate uncertainties through flood modeling, damage, loss, and recovery. Both short-term and long-term impacts of different flood resilience measures are included. The largest gap identified in flood risk research was the need for a standardized quantitative assessment tool or framework that could measure the impact of approaches to improve resilience at the community level. That tool should include the interactions between the different community systems (physical infrastructure, economic systems, and social systems).

Considering the age of these buildings (more than 70 years) two mechanical properties for the masonry were defined. The seismic action considered is defined by elastic response spectrum defined by Eurocode 8 for the seismic acceleration of Barcelona. To analyze these buildings the capacity spectrum method was used, from which the capacity curve and the fragility curves are obtained for evaluating the seismic expected damage. Damage probability matrices quantified the seismic damage and they are obtained from the fragility curves and the performance point.

22273,"Vulnerability of buildings to windstorms and insurance loss estimation Windstorms cause enormous loss to life and property worldwide. Insurance companies use risk assessment models to assess the financial risk to their insurance exposure due to windstorms. The estimation of the intensity of hazard and the vulnerability of buildings to windstorms are important parts of a windstorm risk assessment model. The vulnerability functions (or curves) are, in general, based on analyses of loss data from insurance companies. The loss data available from insurance companies following a natural disaster is generally comprised of losses representative of a wide variety of buildings, often lacking information on building-specific characteristics such as height and material. Analysis of such data may not go beyond the development of an aggregate (or generic) vulnerability curve for a combined portfolio giving no idea of the vulnerability of individual building types represented by this curve. The paper discusses the vulnerability of buildings to windstorms and the development of vulnerability functions for windstorm loss estimation. A methodology is presented for the disaggregation of a generic vulnerability curve into several curves representing individual building types. The methodology provides a convenient way of translating known vulnerabilities for a region to those for another region by combining them with actuarial data and building inventory information of the region. The methodology is applied for the disaggregation of generic vulnerability curves for the Caribbean Island of Puerto Rico. The hurricane hazards and the consequent property losses in the region are also discussed.

Survey data were collected by the Italian Department of Civil Protection during post-earthquake usability inspections including information on building characteristics, level and extent of damage to structural and non-structural components. For each building, the Peak Ground Acceleration demand has been determined according to data available from the ShakeMap of the event and the georeferenced building location. The analysis of data highlights the key role played by the damage to non-structural componentsâ€”namely, infills and partitions. Damage Grades according to the European Macroseismic Scale EMS-98 have been derived from damage data to single building components. Two building classes have been defined in the study in order to investigate the influence of number of storeys of buildings on the observed damage. Damage Probability Matrices have been derived for the assumed building classes and bins of Peak Ground Acceleration, and observed trends are analyzed. Different methodologies for estimating fragility functions from data on Damage Grades and Peak Ground Acceleration demand are illustrated, discussed and applied to the database, leading to the derivation of EMS-98-based fragility curves for the defined building classes.

13449,"Seismic vulnerability assessment of low-rise unreinforced masonry buildings in Northeast India considering variability of material properties Unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings are the most common building typology in the rural and urban areas of Northeast India. These URM buildings suffered substantial damage during earthquakes. In this context, the paper makes an effort to assess the vulnerability of URM buildings of this region through fragility analysis. Four representative URM buildings, consisting of single- and double-storey, have been selected from a group of buildings in the Northeastern part of India based on a suitable statistical parameter to reflect the commonly constructed building typology. Following the equivalent frame modelling approach, each building has been modelled with varying material properties, and thus, a total of 60 building models have been developed. Non-linear static analysis is performed for all the buildings to obtain the probability distribution function (pdf) of the damage states based on the capacity curve parameters. Inelastic displacement demands have been calculated for all the buildings based on the expressions given in FEMA 440 along with the response spectrum of Indian seismic code, IS 1893 Part I. Fragility curves are then derived from the complementary cumulative distribution function (cdf) of displacement demand and pdf of damage states. It is seen that there is a very high probability of suffering major to complete damage for URM buildings subjected to a peak ground acceleration of 0.18 g. Furthermore, derived fragility curves give reasonable predictions of observed post-earthquake building damage and can be used for the earthquake risk assessment of the same building typology of this Northeastern region of India. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.

16996,"Displacement determination of concrete reinforcement building using data-driven models Decision making on buildings after the earthquake have always been a great concern of scientists. Safety concerns, possibility of using the building, repairing the building, and the rate of damage are some of the most vital factors that needs to be paid attention in immediate decision makings of the buildings. In order to determine the level of damage in the buildings, the maximum displacement of stories is one of the most important parameter that needs to be investigated. In this paper, a concrete frame with shear wall containing 4-stories and 4-bays has been designed for acceleration records of 0.1g to 1.5g and the rate of damage is determined. The total of 450 data with 6 input variables and one output variable is produced. The input parameters are defined as frequency, Vs, Richter, the distance from the earthquake epicentre (DEE), PGA, and acceleration, and the output parameter is defined as drift. With respect to this data set, three different data-driven models, i.e. Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and Multiple Linear Regression Model (MLR) are used to predict the displacements. Results indicate that Both the ANN and ANFIS model show great accuracies in estimating the displacements in concrete frame with shear wall. On the other hand, MLR model did not show acceptable accuracy in the same estimation purposes. Finally, the sensitivity analysis was performed on the data set and it was observed that the accuracy of the predictions highly depends on the number of input parameters. In other words, increasing the number of input parameters would result in the increase in the accuracy of the final prediction results.

18545,"INSYDE: A synthetic, probabilistic flood damage model based on explicit cost analysis Methodologies to estimate economic flood damages are increasingly important for flood risk assessment and management. In this work, we present a new synthetic flood damage model based on a component-by-component analysis of physical damage to buildings. The damage functions are designed using an expert-based approach with the support of existing scientific and technical literature, loss adjustment studies, and damage surveys carried out for past flood events in Italy. The model structure is designed to be transparent and flexible, and therefore it can be applied in different geographical contexts and adapted to the actual knowledge of hazard and vulnerability variables. The model has been tested in a recent flood event in northern Italy. Validation results provided good estimates of post-event damages, with similar or superior performances when compared with other damage models available in the literature. In addition, a local sensitivity analysis was performed in order to identify the hazard variables that have more influence on damage assessment results. © Author(s) 2016.

15177,"A machine learning-based prediction and analysis of flood affected households: A case study of floods in Bangladesh Floods are one of the most frequently occurring disasters in Bangladesh that cause small to large scale damage every year. Most of the studies in the literature provide a flood damage prediction or inference model at individual building level. Some of the works that adopt a higher spatial scale such as households conduct their analysis on a few specific regions. This paper presents a household-level flood damage analysis performed on 2004â€“2009 flood data from 64 districts of Bangladesh. The study focuses both on prediction and determination of influencing factors because both of these facilitate flood damage reduction programs. A machine learning driven approach has been taken for prediction where three learning algorithms namely linear regression, random forest and artificial neural network are fitted to the data and compared. In this work, linear regression performed better than the other two because its assumptions were considered. A regression analysis showed the significance of the relationship between predictors and damage. Apart from the significant hydrologic predictors, literacy, flood awareness, house structure and disaster management knowledge were found to be influential. Preparedness was observed to be statistically insignificant unless it was combined with disaster management knowledge. A principal component analysis was further performed to cluster different variables into predictor groups and inspect their effect on flood damage. According to this analysis, hydrologic and environmental predictors, literacy, land ownership and house structure were found to be highly important where precaution and disaster related factors showed less significance.

19960,"RC infilled building performance against the evidence of the 2016 EEFIT Central Italy post-earthquake reconnaissance mission: empirical fragilities and comparison with the FAST method Damage data on low-to-mid-rise Reinforced Concrete (RC) buildings, collected during the UK Earthquake Engineering Field Investigation Team post-earthquake reconnaissance mission on the August 24 Central Italy earthquake, are employed to derive empirical fragility relationships. Given the small dataset, the new data distributions are used for the Bayesian update of fragility functions derived for the L’Aquila earthquake (same seismic region and similar construction typologies). Other properties such as number of storeys, age of construction and shape in plan of the buildings are also analyzed. This information is employed to assess the ability of the FAST method to predict damage states in non-regular infilled RC buildings for the municipalities of Amatrice, Accumoli, Arquata del Tronto and Norcia, all severely affected by the 2016 Central Italy sequence. FAST is a spectral-based method to derive capacity curves and peak ground acceleration damage state thresholds for buildings. It is a dedicated methodology for regular RC frame buildings with masonry infills, first calibrated on damage data from the 2009 L’Aquila earthquake and applied to the 2011 Lorca (Spain), the 2012 Emilia (Italy) events for damage back-analyses. The new data from the August 2016 Central Italy earthquake provide a test-bed for FAST further employments in case of less homogenous building samples. The application of FAST presented here accounts for different shake-maps produced by both the United States Geological Survey and the Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology which are significantly different and representative of different refinements of the demand scenario. For the area of Amatrice, where the two shake-maps provide similar estimates and the buildings considered match reasonably well the typology for which FAST is calibrated, the comparison between damage level observed and as provided by FAST is very satisfactory. For other structural typologies like RC industrial structures and dwellings with non-hollow-clay-bricks as infills, FAST needs further calibration. © 2017, The Author(s).

17995,"Fragility Curves Based on Data from the 2011 Tohoku-Oki Tsunami in Ishinomaki City, with Discussion of Parameters Influencing Building Damage The 63,605 damaged buildings from the 2011 Tohoku-oki tsunami in Ishinomaki were used to develop 52 fragility curves using linear regression. The data comprise the damage level and the measured inundation depth for each building. In agreement with previous studies, the present results indicate that reinforced concrete and steel buildings with three stories or more perform better under tsunami loading. Performance with respect to their intended function was found to depend mainly on structural material. Moreover, based on Japan's design code for earthquake-resistant buildings, buildings constructed after 1981 do not display a better performance compared to more recent constructions. Finally, the results show that for the same inundation depth, a higher damage probability exists along a ria coast due to higher flow velocities, confirmed by numerical simulation and survivor videos. These new findings are useful for building damage assessment, town reconstruction, and comparison of vulnerability functions in future studies.

The method takes damage correlation into account, which depends on the relative distance between buildings, and a numerical technique based on the theorem of total probability was employed.

19740,"Probabilistic fragility analysis: A tool for assessing design rules of RC buildings In this work, fragility analysis is performed to assess two groups of reinforced concrete structures. The first group of structures is composed of buildings that implement three common design practices; namely, fully infilled, weak ground story and short columns. The three design practices are applied during the design process of a reinforced concrete building. The structures of the second group vary according to the value of the behavioral factors used to define the seismic forces as specified in design procedures. Most seismic design codes belong to the class of prescriptive procedures where if certain constraints are fulfilled, the structure is considered safe. Prescriptive design procedures express the ability of the structure to absorb energy through inelastic deformation using the behavior factor. The basic objective of this work is to assess both groups of structures with reference to the limit-state probability of exceedance. Thus, four limit state fragility curves are developed on the basis of nonlinear static analysis for both groups of structures. Moreover, the 95% confidence intervals of the fragility curves are also calculated, taking into account two types of random variables that influence structural capacity and seismic demand. © 2008 Institute of Engineering Mechanics.

18925,"Modeling wind vulnerability of French houses to European extra-tropical cyclones using empirical methods Extra-tropical cyclones that occur between Autumn and Spring in northern Europe results in billions of dollars of economic as well as insured loss annually across Europe. The wind footprint of these storms are characterised by low level peak gusts over wide swathes of a region with varying spatial intensification subject to local site conditions as well as meteorological variations. The damage from these low level peak gusts are typically to the roofing and cladding elements of the building with some occurrences of structural damage and indirect damage from tree fall. This paper first identifies the damage modes from Europe extra-tropical cyclones and studies the design and construction practices of French buildings focusing on residential single-family homes. A relative meso-scale vulnerability summary in terms of frequency of highest design level occurrences for wind, snow, earthquake loads and roof construction practices for wind and rain was developed. This showed that regions in the north-west and Mediterranean coast were expected to have the lowest wind vulnerability, while the south-west the highest, which is consistent with the experience from insurance loss data from Lothar, Martin and Klaus windstorms.

21292,"Sensitivity of engineering demand parameters as a function of structural typology and assessment method Fragility curves express the failure probability of a structure, or a critical component, as a function of a seismic intensity measure, for a given failure criterion. The failure criterion is often built as the difference between a structural response and a threshold, which can be either deterministic or probabilistic. Within a probabilistic context, the structural response is a random variable and therefore, it will be subjected to a certain variability mostly depending on the structural typology and the assessment method. When engineers have to make a decision to choose the appropriate engineering demand parameter to consider, they need to know how much sensitive it will be. The study reported in this paper attempts to bring answers to this question. More precisely, the sensitivity of some engineering demand parameters is quantified and discussed as a function of the structural typology (beam-column or wall-based structures) and of the considered assessment method. The final output is a correlation matrix linking (i) the coefficient of variation of specific engineering demand parameters, (ii) the structural typology and (iii) the type of assessment method.

19468,"Performance-based damage assessment of low-rise reinforced concrete buildings For any places located in zones with high seismic risk, seismic damage assessment of buildings is a crucial issue. In the past few years, much attention has been paid to the concept of performance-based assessment due to ATC-40. However, its tedious procedure and deficiency in precision have left room for improvement. In the present paper, a modified procedure is introduced. It is expected to improve the efficiency as well as accuracy of the assessment. The main idea of the modification is to treat the performance points on the structural capacity curve as input, and subsequently determine the corresponding seismic demands of RC structures. The proposed approach is also capable of finding the correlations between peak ground acceleration (PGA) and various structural performances. On the other hand, it is well known that the accuracy of pushover analysis is greatly affected by the proper setting of the plastic hinges. Here, an algorithm for determining plastic hinges with respect to three well-known distinct failure modes is also suggested. To further testify to the adequacy of the new approach, a practical low-rise traditional RC school building damaged in the Chi-Chi earthquake is adopted as a case study. Following the proposed seismic damage assessment procedures, a pushover analysis based on the suggested algorithm is performed to find the ultimate PGA that the building could sustain. The accuracy of the results is then verified by applying the nonlinear time history analysis. It is seen that the proposed method gives acceptable results and is expected to be helpful both in facilitating seismic damage assessment, as well as in formulating strategies for repairing, retrofitting, or strengthening for RC buildings. © 2006, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

18120,"From rapid visual survey to multi-hazard risk prioritisation and numerical fragility of school buildings Regional seismic risk assessment is paramount in earthquake-prone areas, for instance, to define and implement prioritisation schemes for earthquake risk reduction. As part of the Indonesia School Programme to Increase Resilience (INSPIRE), this paper proposes an ad hoc rapidvisual-survey form, allowing one to (1) calculate the newly proposed INSPIRE seismic risk prioritisation index, which is an empirical proxy for the relative seismic risk of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings within a given building portfolio; (2) calculate the Papathoma Tsunami Vulnerability Assessment (PTVA) index, in any of its variations; (3) define one or more archetype buildings representative of the analysed portfolio; (4) derive detailed numerical models of the archetype buildings, provided that the simulated design is used to crosscheck the model assumptions. The proposed INSPIRE index combines a baseline score, calibrated based on fragility curves, and a performance modifier, calibrated through the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to minimise subjectivity. An attempt to define a multi-hazard prioritisation scheme is proposed, combining the INSPIRE and PTVA indices. Such a multi-level framework is implemented for 85 RC school buildings in Banda Aceh, Indonesia, the most affected city by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake-tsunami sequence. As part of the proposed framework, two archetype buildings representative of the entire portfolio are defined based on the collected data. Their seismic performance is analysed by means of non-linear static analyses, using both the analytical simple lateral mechanism analysis (SLaMA) method and numerical finite-element pushover analyses to investigate the expected plastic mechanisms and derive displacement/drift thresholds to define appropriate damage states. Finally, non-linear dynamic analyses are performed to derive fragility curves for the archetype buildings. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the INSPIRE data collection form and proposed index in providing a rational method to derive seismic risk prioritisation schemes and in allowing the definition of archetype buildings for more detailed evaluations/analyses. © Author(s) 2019.

12877,"Empirical seismic fragility functions based on field survey data after the 5 May 2014 Mae Lao (Northern Thailand) earthquake Empirical seismic fragility curves have been developed based on post-seismic survey data on official building damage, collected in the epicentral area of Mw 6.1, 2014 Mae Lao earthquake. In total, about 26,551 survey building data have been investigated by authorities and engineers. The typical pattern of observed damage for different structures and the reasons for damage are presented. In addition, damage statistics in the field are correlated with ground motion in order to derive empirical seismic fragility curves. Using a maximum likelihood method, different sets of fragility curves are developed to demonstrate the influence of structural material on building damage level. The good correlation between observed damage and peak ground acceleration (PGA) are observed. In addition, the results show a better seismic performance of the engineered reinforced concrete building over non-engineered buildings. These findings are essential to support a better future building damage assessments, land use management, and seismic risk mitigation planning. © 2019 The Authors 2014 Mae Lao earthquake  Non-engineered building  Seismic fragility curve  Thailand None",Empirical seismic fragility functions based on field survey data after the 5 May 2014 Mae Lao (Northern Thailand) earthquake,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,Empirical
17927,"Fragility Analysis of Space Reinforced Concrete Frame Structures with Structural Irregularity in Plan Because significant damages to structures having structural irregularity in their plans were repeatedly observed during many past earthquakes, there have been great research efforts to evaluate their seismic vulnerability. Although most of the previous studies used simplified structural representations such as one-dimensional or two-dimensional models in the fragility analysis of plan-irregular structures, simple analytical models could not represent true seismic behavior from the complicated nonlinear coupling between lateral and torsional responses as the degree of irregularity increased. For space structures with high irregularity, more realistic representations such as three-dimensional models are needed for proper seismic assessment. However, the use of computationally expensive models is not practically feasible with existing approaches of fragility analysis. Thus, in this study, a different approach is adopted that can produce vulnerability curves efficiently, even with a three-dimensional model. In this approach, an integrated computational framework is established that combines reliability analysis and structural analysis. This enables evaluation of the limit-state faction without constructing its explicit formula, and the failure probability is calculated with the first-order reliability method (FORM) to deal with the computational challenge. Under the integrated framework, this study investigates the seismic vulnerability of space reinforced concrete frame structures with varying plan irregularity. Material uncertainty is considered, and more representative seismic fragility curves are derived with their three-dimensional analytical models. The effectiveness of the adopted approach is discussed, and the significant effect of structural irregularity on seismic vulnerability is highlighted.

21084,"Seismic Vulnerability Analysis of Rock Mountain Tunnel Seismic fragility analysis is a way to study the vulnerability of structures considering various uncertainties. In the paper, a seismic vulnerability analysis of rock mountain tunnels is proposed. The uniform design method (UDM), a computationally economic method for experiment design, is adopted here. Through the UDM, experiment samples are generated considering variability of the variables. Different tunnel depths, tunnel scales, rock masses, and lining thicknesses are considered. Verified dynamical finite element analysis is carried out to develop probabilistic seismic demand models. The fragility curves are established based on probabilistic seismic demand models. It is concluded that (1) UDM can generate good samples considering different sources of uncertainties; (2) a comparison between the established vulnerability curves and the empirical ones validate the feasibility of the developed methodology.

13562,"Tsunami analytical fragility curves for the Colombian Pacific coast: A reinforced concrete building example From the last large seismic movements generated in the Pacific Ocean, it has been demonstrated that tsunamis have a high potential of destruction of buildings on the coasts. In that sense, although along the Pacific Colombian coast several earthquakes that have generated tsunami were reported during the last century, there are no local data to quantify the physical damage that future events could produce on nearby cities. For the purpose of establishing tools to increase the risk management capabilities along the Colombian-Ecuadorian Pacific Coast, this paper summarizes a research aimed to describe a new integrated methodology to obtain fragility curves for local buildings at risk of a tsunami. This task was accomplished using computational nonlinear structural analysis, combined with a Monte Carlo statistical algorithm to obtain numerical probabilistic fragility curves. The structural capacity of buildings was obtained from nonlinear structural simulations using the finite element method, to calculate later the damage of each building. Two different damage models to estimate the probability of damage were tested in order to evaluate the one that better represents the structural behavior of buildings, in which the tsunami was considered in the structural model as forces scattered to different heights, thus representing different flow depths. As a result, a methodology was developed to calculate theoretical probabilistic fragility curves for the typical structures found in the Colombian Pacific coast, although this methodology could be expanded to any structural system located in any region around the world. As an illustrative example, the methodology proposed in this research was applied to a typical reinforced concrete building, obtained from a previous work in which all the Tumaco city buildings were characterized according to their structural features. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd Colombian Pacific coast  Damage models  Fragility curves  Risk  Structural capacity  Tsunamis Concrete buildings  Reinforced concrete  Risk management  Risks  Damage model  Fragility curves  Integrated methodology  Management capabilities  Nonlinear structural analysis  Pacific coasts  Structural capacities  Structural simulations  Tsunamis  analytical framework  building  concrete structure  damage  reinforced concrete  risk assessment  structural analysis  structural response  tsunami  Colombia  Pacific Coast [Colombia]  Pacific Coast [South America]",Tsunami analytical fragility curves for the Colombian Pacific coast: A reinforced concrete building example,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,Analytical
20865,"Seismic performance of four-storey masonry infilled reinforced concrete frame building Masonry infilled reinforced concrete frames are a structural system commonly used for low-to-mid-rise buildings. Generally, this type of structure is modelled as an open frame neglecting the strength and stiffness contribution of the masonry infilled panel. In order to describe realistic behaviour under lateral loading, this paper evaluates the seismic performance of the building by modelling the contribution of masonry as a compression strut acting diagonally in the panel. The non-linear static procedure is employed by subjecting the building to pushover loads. The performance of the building is then analysed based on the obtained capacity curve. Seismic performance is assessed in terms of building fragility which is the conditional probability of exceeding certain damage state for a given ground shaking intensity. Fragility functions eventually are expressed as series of log-normal curves of both the open and masonry infilled reinforced concrete frame. Based on this study, the infilled frame can resist a maximum load of 20.3x103 kN, while the open frame is only able to withstand a maximum load of 15.2x103 kN. From the fragility curve, it can be concluded that the probability of the infilled frame to reach a certain damage state is lower than that of the open frame. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.

The strong ground motion models considered include five modern ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) amply used worldwide. Capacity and fragility curves from the Risk-UE project are utilized to model building vulnerability and expected damage. Damage estimates resulting from different combinations of GMPE and capacity/fragility curves are compared with the actual damage scenario, establishing the combination that best explains the observed damage distribution. In addition, some recommendations are proposed, including correction factors in fragility curves in order to reproduce in a better way the observed damage in masonry and reinforce concrete buildings.

17997,"Fragility curves definition of existing reinforced concrete buildings designed for gravity loads Urban areas with a significant number of buildings designed without earthquake resistant concepts may undergo high losses following major earthquakes. However, an adequate design is the direct result of a comprehensive knowledge of the seismic hazard. In Italy, for example, the seismic zonation was completed in recent years, thus a significant number of buildings lack adequate lateral capacity. For this reason, preventive assessment of their vulnerability and expected damage is crucial. This paper presents the vulnerability assessment of two reinforced concrete buildings designed for gravity loads and representative of the Pescara Province in the Abruzzi Region (Central Italy). Geometrical and structural characteristics of the buildings are initially derived from an existing database based on structured interviews with local technicians. The two buildings are then modeled using a simulated design approach following two different buildings codes. Nonlinear dynamic analyses are carried out in order to derive a suite of fragility curves for different damage states. These curves may be used to predict the expected damage following earthquakes of increasing intensities and plan mitigation strategies. © 2021 COMPDYN Proceedings.

15654,"Application of fuzzy theory on earthquake damage rate estimation of buildings Variations between earthquakes result in many factors that influence post-earthquake building damage (e.g., ground motion parameters, building structure, site information, and quality of construction). Consequently, it is necessary to develop an appropriate building damage-rate estimation model. The building damage survey data were recorded and constructed into files by the Architecture and Building Research Institute (ABRI), Taiwan for the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake in the Nantou region as a basis for developing a building damage rate estimation model by applying fuzzy theory to express the fragility curves of buildings as a membership function. Empirical verification was performed using post-earthquake building damage data in the Taichung city that suffered relatively severe damage. Results indicate that fuzzy theory can be applied to predict building damage rates and that the estimated results are similar to actual disaster figures.

16840,"Developing tsunami fragility curves based on the satellite remote sensing and the numerical modeling of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami in Thailand The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami damaged and destroyed numerous buildings and houses in Thailand. Estimation of tsunami impact to buildings from this event and evaluation of the potential risks are important but still in progress. The tsunami fragility curve is a function used to estimate the structural fragility against tsunami hazards. This study was undertaken to develop fragility curves using visual inspection of high-resolution satellite images (IKONOS) taken before and after tsunami events to classify whether the buildings were destroyed or not based on the remaining roof. Then, a tsunami inundation model is created to reconstruct the tsunami features such as inundation depth, current velocity, and hydrodynamic force of the event. It is assumed that the fragility curves are expressed as normal or lognormal distribution functions and the estimation of the median and log-standard deviation is performed using least square fitting. From the results, the developed fragility curves for different types of building materials (mixed type, reinforced concrete and wood) show consistent performance in damage probability and when compared to the existing curves for other locations. © Author(s) 2011.

18364,"Implementation and validation of an approach for the estimation of the magnitude of historical earthquakes in Azores Islands In many regions of the globe, the seismic data associated with higher magnitude seismic events usable in the characterization of the seismic hazard is scarce. Therefore, seismologists have been estimating the magnitude and probable epicentral location of historical earthquakes using the historical records and intensity scales to map the observed damage. Another method, employed by earthquake engineers, uses fragility functions, a ground motion model and the Bayes’ theorem to estimate the probable magnitude of historical seismic events. Nevertheless, this method requires assembling an approach consistent with the local seismicity and building stock of the period of reference. This paper implements and validates an approach for the estimation of the magnitude of historical seismic events in Azores Islands, Portugal, that uses fragility functions. In order to carry out this study, data from the damage surveys, a vulnerability distribution and approximate epicentral positions of the 1998 Faial earthquake Mw = 6.0–6.2, as well as a specific attenuation model, are utilized in a calibration phase. The vulnerability index methodology is employed to derive fragility functions from a detailed vulnerability assessment. Afterwards, the approach is validated using analogous data corresponding to the 1980 Terceira earthquake Mw = 6.8–7.2. The different assumptions and results are discussed and compared. The results show that this approach can model expected magnitude values with accuracy: Mw = 6.01–5.76 for the 1998 Faial and Mw = 6.90–6.55 for the 1980 Terceira earthquakes. Additionally, the real PGAs may have been in several locations lower than those predicted by the selected ground motion equation.

22008,"Tsunami inundation modeling: Sensitivity of velocity and momentum flux to bottom friction with application to building damage at Seaside, Oregon We examine the sensitivity of three different tsunami inundation numerical models using various friction terms. We use the model output to examine the probabilistic damage levels using fragility curves applied over a community scale and resolved at the scale of individual tax lots for Seaside, OR. With this work, we estimate the inundation hazard using the ""500 year"" tsunami originating from a Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake and then compare the maximum surface elevation, velocity, and momentum flux results across the three models. We find a larger variation in the velocities and momentum fluxes when varying model types and friction coefficients; surface elevation variations are not as large. We also find that absolute velocity and momentum flux are more sensitive to friction factors rather than model type, while surface elevation varies with model type. For the fragility curve analysis, we consider flow depth, velocity, and momentum flux as the intensity measure to estimate the probability of a certain damage level based on the known structure type and characteristic tsunami intensity. We examine the sensitivity of damage levels to various fragility curves, using different intensity measures, and we find that velocity and momentum flux curves provide a more realistic estimate of damage.

16905,"Development of Fragility Curves for Japanese Buildings Based on Integrated Damage Data from the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake A series of earthquakes hit Kumamoto Prefecture on Kyushu Island, Japan on April 14 and 16, 2016. Soon after the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, municipal governments carried out building damage surveys to issue disaster-victim certificates. The building damage caused by the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake was serious in Mashiki Town, which is located close to the source region, but Uki City, next to that area, was also heavily damaged. The present authors have already developed several fragility curves using damage survey data from the Mashiki Town and Uki City governments. Some of the fragility curves for Mashiki Town rise sharply at low PGV levels because of the lack of damage data in the low PGV range. Compared with the fragility curves for Mashiki Town, the fragility curves for Uki City show a lower damage ratio for the same PGV. The fragility curves for Uki City were obtained using the damage data in the PGV range lower than those for Mashiki Town. In this study, we integrated the damage survey data of the Mashiki Town government and the Uki City government due to the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, and constructed building fragility curves with respect to the structural material and construction period in combination with the estimated seismic motion distribution. The correlation coefficient showed a strong positive correlation of approximately 0.9 in all classifications of the building fragility curves covering a wide range of seismic ground motions.

22209,"Vulnerability analysis for gravity load designed RC buildings in Naples - Italy Damage scenario and risk analyses are helpful tools for the local administrators for mitigation of potential earthquake losses at the urban-regional level. One of the main issues in developing such scenarios is the choice of proper capacity functions expressing the effective seismic supply for the existing building classes and the convolution with demand in the so-called fragility analysis. This article, as a further implementation of a recently developed mechanical based procedure for class scale quantitative risk evaluation, presents the derivation of class representative capacity curves and the relative fragility curves for slight, moderate, extensive, and complete damage states as defined by the well-known HAZUS methodology. Starting from an extensive building survey of Arenella district in Naples, southern Italy, statistics on main model input parameters are obtained for selected building classes of existing and/or pre-code RC buildings. Accordingly, a number of building models is simulated designed and analyzed in order to determine building class capacity. Fragility curves are computed simulating the fraction of failures within a capacity spectrum method framework. These capacity and fragility curves have been used in a companion paper by Lang et al.

17973,"Fragility assessment of slab-column connections in existing non-ductile reinforced concrete buildings Fragility functions that estimate the probability of exceeding different levels of damage in slab-column connections of existing non-ductile reinforced concrete buildings subjected to earthquakes are presented. The proposed fragility functions sure based on experimental data from 16 investigations conducted in the last 36 years that include a total of 82 specimens. Fragility functions corresponding to four damage states are presented as functions of the level of peak interstory drift imposed on the connection. For damage states involving punching shear failure and loss of vertical carrying capacity, the fragility functions are also a function of the vertical shear in the connection produced by gravity loads normalised by the nominal vertical shear strength in the absence of unbalanced moments. Two sources of uncertainty in the estimation of damage as a function of lateral deformation are studied and discussed. The first is the specimen-to-specimen variability of the drifts associated with a damage state, and the second the epistemic uncertainty arising from using small samples of experimental data and from interpreting the experimental results.

In this paper, a framework of extracting time-varying mean component and determining time-varying fluctuating component of nonstationary signals is established, which is applied to investigate the on-site measured near-ground nonstationary wind velocities and wind-induced pressures on the roof of a typical low-rise building during a typhoon. It is observed that near-ground wind characteristic parameters (including turbulence intensities, gust factors, peak factors and turbulence integral length scales, wind spectra) and wind pressure coefficients on the roof obtained by the nonstationary analytical approach are more reasonable than those determined by the conventional stationary analytical approach. Besides, the evolutionary power spectral density is used to examine time-frequency spectra of wind velocities and wind pressures. This comparative study based on the nonstationary and stationary analysis approaches aims to further the understanding of the nonstationary surface layer wind characteristics and wind pressures on typical low-rise buildings for reduction of windstorm damages to residential buildings in typhoon-prone regions.

21087,"Seismic vulnerability and fragility of existing Italian industrial steel buildings Introduction: The recent L’Aquila (2009) and Emilia-Romagna (2012) Italian earthquakes have highlighted the vulnerability of recently erected buildings, with particular reference to industrial ones. Although steel buildings have usually demonstrated a good behaviour under earthquakes, with limited damages and rare cases of collapse, they still represent a structural typology at risk due to the significant exposure connected to the importance of the resources they host. Methods: In the paper a parametric study on several industrial steel buildings, different for typology, geometrical dimensions, seismic zones and snow geographic areas, has been done through pushover analyses. Results and Conclusion: The results have allowed to plot vulnerability curves, which have been compared to seismic fragility curves derived from literature observational studies. The comparison among curves has allowed to estimate the effectiveness of the literature fragility studies, as well as to evaluate the seismic damages suffered by investigated structures under dissimilar grade earthquakes. © 2017 Formisano et al.

16338,"Consideration of aging and SSI effects on seismic vulnerability assessment of RC buildings At present, the seismic vulnerability assessment of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings is made considering fixed base conditions; moreover, the mechanical properties of the building remain intact in time. In this study we investigate whether these two fundamental hypotheses are sound as aging and soil-structure interaction (SSI) effects might play a crucial role in the seismic fragility analysis of RC structures. Among the various aging processes, we consider the chloride-induced corrosion based on probabilistic modeling of corrosion initiation time and corrosion rate. Different corrosion aspects are considered in the analysis including the loss of reinforcement cross-sectional area, the degradation of concrete cover and the reduction of steel ultimate deformation. SSI is modeled by applying the direct one-step approach, which accounts simultaneously for inertial and kinematic interactions. Two-dimensional incremental dynamic analysis is performed to assess the seismic performance of the initial uncorroded (t=0 years) and corroded (t = 50 years) RC moment resisting frame structures, having been designed with different seismic code levels. The time-dependent fragility functions are derived in terms of the spectral acceleration at the fundamental mode of the structure Sa(T1, 5%) and the outcropping peak ground acceleration for the immediate occupancy and collapse prevention limit states. Results show an overall increase in seismic vulnerability over time due to corrosion highlighting the important influence of deterioration due to aging effects on the structural behavior. Moreover, the consideration of SSI and site effects may significantly alter the expected structural performance leading to higher vulnerability values. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

22224,"Vulnerability assessment and earthquake damage scenarios of the building stock of Potenza (Southern Italy) using Italian and Greek methodologies The prevailing Italian and Greek methodologies for seismic risk assessment are used herein to construct loss scenarios for the building stock of a small city (Potenza, Southern Italy). The inventory of buildings of interest is obtained from a survey carried out after the 1990 earthquake that struck Potenza and its hinterland, subsequently updated in 1999. About 12,000 buildings were surveyed in Potenza, using the Italian first level survey form for damage and vulnerability evaluation. In the Italian methodology, a hybrid technique is set up to evaluate vulnerability, combining an analysis of building typologies with expert judgement. The probabilistic distribution of damage is evaluated by assigning Damage Probability Matrices (DPMs) from the literature. Besides the vulnerability classes A, B and C of the MSK-scale, the class D of the anti-seismic buildings is considered and the relevant DPM is defined. Damage and economic loss scenarios relevant to dwelling buildings are constructed for three reference earthquakes. Next, the hybrid methodology for seismic vulnerability assessment of reinforced concrete (R/C) and masonry buildings developed at the University of Thessaloniki (Greece) is applied to the same building stock. The methodology combines available statistical data of damage collected after past earthquakes with a systematic nonlinear analysis of various â€œmodel buildingsâ€, representative of several vulnerability classes. Similarities, as well as discrepancies, between the two methods are discussed in the light of the obtained results, and possible sources for the discrepancies are suggested.

19113,"Nonlinear control of structure using neuro-predictive algorithm A new neural network (NN) predictive controller (NNPC) algorithm has been developed and tested in the computer simulation of active control of a nonlinear structure. In the present method an NN is used as a predictor. This NN has been trained to predict the future response of the structure to determine the control forces. These control forces are calculated by minimizing the differencebetween the predicted and desired responses via a numerical minimization algorithm. Since the NNPC is very time consuming and not suitable for real-time control, it is then used to train an NN controller. To consider the effectiveness of the controller onprobability of damage, fragility curves are generated. The approach is validated by using simulated response of a 3 story nonlinear benchmark building excited by several historical earthquake records. The simulation results are then compared with a linearquadratic Gaussian (LQG) active controller. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is completely effective in relative displacement reduction. Copyright © 2015 Techno-Press, Ltd.

19870,"Quantification of the Approximations Introduced by Assumptions on the Marginal Distribution of the Demand for Highway Bridge Fragility Analysis Fragility analysis is one of the most popular tools for the computation of the probability of reaching each investigated limit state for a given value of the external load intensity. Because of its versatility and computational efficiency, fragility analysis is particularly appropriate for regional loss estimations and risk analyses. Several different techniques have been proposed in the literature to compute the fragility of buildings and bridges. However, most of these techniques rely on simplifications and assumptions which, in some cases, are made more for analytical convenience than for adherence to reality. This paper investigates the effect of three of these common assumptions made on the engineering demand parameters for the case of seismic fragility analyses of bridges: (1) the marginal distribution is lognormal, (2) the median of such distribution follows a power law of the seismic intensity measure of choice, and (3) the dispersion of such distribution is constant for any value of the intensity measure. Numerical analyses have been performed running extensive Monte Carlo simulations on computational clusters, focusing on structural models of different complexity. The results suggest that assumption (1) is not realistic in general, but it does not induce a significant error on the final results, whereas assumptions (2) and (3) significantly corrupt the quality of the results, introducing substantial errors. A comprehensive methodology for the assessment of fragility curves for structural components and systems is then proposed, which does not rely on the above-mentioned assumptions. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

12761,"Deriving fragility functions from bilinearized capacity curves for earthquake scenario modelling using the conditional spectrum The development of fragility curves to perform seismic scenario-based risk assessment requires a fully probabilistic procedure in order to account for uncertainties at each step of the computation. This is especially true when developing fragility curves conditional on an Intensity Measure that is directly available from a ground-motion prediction equation. In this study, we propose a new derivation method that uses realistic spectra instead of design spectral shapes or uniform hazard spectra and allows one to easily account for the features of the site-specific hazard that influences the fragility, without using non-linear dynamic analysis. The proposed method has been applied to typical school building types in the city of Basel (Switzerland) and the results have been compared to the standard practice in Europe. The results confirm that fragility curves are scenario dependent and are particularly sensitive to the magnitude of the earthquake scenario. The same background theory used for the derivation of the fragility curves has allowed an innovative method to be proposed for the conversion of fragility curves to a common IM (i.e. spectral acceleration or PGA). This conversion is the only way direct comparisons of fragility curves can be made and is useful when inter-period correlation cannot be used in scenario loss assessment. Moreover, such conversion is necessary to compare and verify newly developed curves against those from previous studies. Conversion to macroseismic intensity is also relevant for the comparison between mechanical-based and empirical fragility curves, in order to detect possible biases. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

18158,"Generation of Fragility Curves for Typical RC Health Care Facilities: Emphasis on Hospitals in Turkey This study uses fragility curves to focus on the seismic safety evaluation of RC hospital buildings in Turkey. Three hospital buildings with varying heights of 3-5 stories are selected, and a set of fragility curves are generated for each class. The major parameters considered in this study are the number of stories, lateral stiffness, strength, and displacement capacities of the selected template designs. A large number of pushover and time history analyses are deployed under a set of 100 strong ground motion records. Fragility curves are generated based on the analysis results for each of the typical buildings. Peak ground velocity (PGV) is selected as the measure of seismic intensity. From the generated sets of the fragility curves, it is observed that damage probabilities are significantly affected by the concrete and detailing quality. Using the constructed fragility curves, collapse probabilities of existing public buildings were estimated according to PGV values. The estimated damage by fragility analyses is compared with past studies related to RC buildings in the region. Hence, analytical fragility curves developed in this study can increase the effectiveness of seismic assessment of essential health care facilities with template designs in the Turkey region.

22268,"Vulnerability of asymmetric multi-storey buildings in the context of performance-based seismic design Many existing buildings with reinforced concrete structure have, in reality, irregular configurations especially in plan. This category of edifices cannot be avoided due to the functional and architectural requirements. Under strong earthquake trembling, they experience inelastic behaviour which causes torsional effect, one of the most important factors influencing the seismic damage of RC structures during an earthquake. The main intent of this study is to investigate the 3 D seismic demands of RC asymmetric-plan structures by employing Displacement-based Adaptive Pushover methodology. The torsional effect on the structures is considered by varying eccentricity subjected to Pushover Analysis and Non-Linear Time History Analysis, setting up equivalent single degree of freedom system. For this purpose, the seismic behaviour of three asymmetric-plan buildings was studied by considering uncertainties associated with the randomness of the seismic action using accelerograms of real earthquakes compatible with target design spectra. From capacity curves, the damage states and corresponding fragility curves can be obtained. Based on Fibre-element modelling, the analysis of the models is done using OpenSees under Eurocode 8 compliant real record sets.

16851,"Development and evaluation of FLEMOps - a new Flood oss stimation del for the rivate sector The estimation of flood losses is an essential component for risk-oriented flood design, risk mapping or financial appraisals in the reinsurance sector. However, only simple models, e.g. stage-damage curves, have been used frequently. Further, the reliability of flood loss and risk estimates is fairly unknown, since flood loss models are scarcely validated. In the aftermath of flooding in August 2002 large data sets of flood losses were collected at affected properties in Germany. These data were used to derive multi-factorial loss models. This paper presents FLEMOps - the Flood Loss Estimation Model for the private sector, which estimates direct monetary flood losses of residential buildings and household contents considering water level, building type and building quality. In an additional model stage (FLEMOps+), the effects of private precautionary measures as well as of the contamination of the floodwater can be quantified. Together with census data and land use information the model is adapted for applications on the meso-scale. Further, different data sets of repair costs for single buildings and in whole municipalities were used to validate loss estimates on the micro- as well as on the meso-scale. First results show that the model FLEMOps+ outperforms simple stage-damage-functions. damage estimation  precaution  contamination  model validation  flood losses DAMAGE  BUILDINGS",Development and evaluation of FLEMOps - a new Flood oss stimation del for the rivate sector,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1452581980329069,0.17136712426991077,0.14989226930182206,0.004589581604862796,Empirical
15312,"A procedure for seismic risk assessment of Italian masonry buildings This paper describes a fragility model for the seismic risk assessment of residential masonry buildings, by taking advantage of Italian post-earthquake damage data collected in the time span 1980-2009. The proposed model includes empirically-derived fragility curves for three vulnerability classes, further subdivided based on the building height (i.e. low-rise and mid-/high-rise). To this aim, damage data are uniformly allocated to predefined building typologies, representative of the Italian built environment, and damage levels. Typological fragility curves are derived for five damage states of the EMS-98, considering the peak ground acceleration from shakemap as the selected ground motion intensity measure. The predefined masonry building typologies are then attributed to the vulnerability classes. The proposed model is then implemented in the framework of the Italian national platform for assessing seismic risk at different scale levels (e.g. regional and national scales) and an example of application is presented.

20609,"Seismic Fragility and Risk Assessment of a Nuclear Power Plant Containment Building for Seismic Input Based on the Conditional Spectrum A procedure for the seismic fragility assessment of nuclear power plants by applying ground motions compatible with the conditional probability distribution of a conditional spectrum (CS) is presented with a case study of a containment building. Three CSs were constructed using different control frequencies to investigate the influence of the control frequency. Horizontal component-to-component directional variability was introduced by randomly rotating the horizontal axes of the recorded ground motions. Nonlinear lumped mass stick models were constructed using variables distributed by Latin hypercube sampling to model the uncertainty. An incremental dynamic analysis was performed, and seismic fragility curves were calculated. In addition, a seismic input based on a uniform hazard response spectrum (UHRS) was applied to the seismic fragility assessment for comparison. By selecting a control frequency dominating the seismic response, the CS-based seismic input produces an enhanced ‘high confidence of low probability of failure’ capacity and lower seismic risk than the UHRS-based seismic input. © 2022 by the authors.

18604,"Inventory method for urban seismic risk studies The first step in seismic risk assessment studies consists of collecting the inventory of the exposed assets. The distribution of the building types combined with respective fragility curves and assumed seismic scenario generates results for the damage estimates. Building specific parameters used in urban seismic risk studies are traditionally collected by sidewalk surveys relying mainly on the global visual characteristics. This approach is, however, time consuming and the reliability of the assigned structural type is highly dependent on the surveyor expertise. A methodological approach for rapid building inventory is proposed with the objective to increase efficiency and reduce subjectivity in data collection. It is based on analyses of the information given in municipal property databases. The statistical analyses of the municipal data were combined with a study of the evolution of typical construction systems in Québec City, selected as a study area, and the Province of Québec in general. Correlations were established between the municipal data and building types proposed in Hazus loss estimation methodology to build an inference matrix indicating the most probable structural type to be assigned to a building, The developed inventory methodology was applied over two samples of buildings, 207 and more than 2,000 buildings in downtown Québec City, to validate the assumptions of the inference matrix. The calibrated procedure was then applied to the whole set of 16,421 buildings.

22256,"Vulnerability assessment of reinforced concrete frame structures designed according to romanian codes The damaged produced worldwide by earthquakes and their secondary effects during the past decade show that the vulnerability assessment of the entire building stock should be evaluated. Various methodologies for the evaluation of the seismic vulnerability have been proposed as a result of research work carried out worldwide. The easiest way to describe the vulnerability of a structure is to represent a lognormal function of the relation between the probability of damage and the spectral displacement. The present paper focuses on the assessment of the seismic vulnerability of reinforced concrete structures. The procedure is based on the capacity curve obtained through a nonlinear static analysis and on four damage states described according to RISK-UE project specification. The vulnerability index is computed based on the values obtained from the fragility curves.

19698,"Probabilistic Building Functionality Estimation Framework for Buildings Subjected to Hurricane Winds Buildings are vulnerable to extreme winds, both physically and functionally. Although many studies exist on buildings' structural and interior damage modeling, limited research exists on the modeling of buildings' functionality loss under extreme winds. In this paper, a novel probabilistic building functionality estimation framework is developed to quantitatively evaluate the functionality of buildings under hurricane winds. The functionality of a building is evaluated by integrating the functionalities of individual building systems (e.g., envelope, interior, electrical, and HVAC) that are determined by a detailed component-level damage analysis considering uncertainty in wind loading, rain ingress, and component resistance capacity. The proposed framework is demonstrated with a 1-story wood residential building by estimating its shelter function. The fragility curves are developed for multiple functionality states of the shelter function and compared with the fragility curves developed for the envelope system only. The comparison indicated that the functionality of a building evaluated by considering the four building systems was significantly lower than the functionality evaluated by considering only the envelope system. Thus, considering the envelope system only will largely underestimate the building functionality loss. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.

17861,"Flood Risk Modeling under Uncertainties: The Case Study of Croatia This study presents an approach for assessing the flood risk using the fully probabilistic description of the annual damage using the derived higher-order statistical moments of the annual damage random variable. The annual damage distribution is used to analyze the impact on the macro-scale agglomeration described with the unified damage function in the case study of the river Kupa, Croatia. The agglomeration damage function is derived through the unit damage function and estimated distribution of building thresholds within the studied agglomeration. The unit damage is described with the shape function, which can easily accommodate different forms of damage assessment depending on the available information. The estimated distribution of annual maximum flood levels is propagated through the agglomeration damage function into the annual damage distribution derived using higher-order statistical moments and presented with the exceedance probability, indicating the likelihood that a certain annual maximum damage can be exceeded. Besides the aleatory uncertainty of annual maximum flood levels, we analyzed the impact of the uncertainty in estimating the unit damage function upon the annual damage distribution. This uncertainty shows a significant impact on the shape of the annual damage distribution, particularly in the region of extreme flood events. Analyzing the annual damage distribution range, resulting from the uncertainty in damage functions, provides more information to policymakers in assessing the potential consequences on the future spatial planning programs, particularly from the strategic environmental assessment point of view. © 2022 by the authors.

21239,"Seismic vulnerability of low-rise residential buildings based on damage data from three earthquakes (Mw6.5, 6.5 and 6.3) In June 2000 two Mw6.5 earthquakes occurred in South Iceland and in May 2008 an Mw6struck in the same area. High PGAs (&gt;0.6 g) were registered in all cases. The epicentres were located in an agriculture region and close to small towns and villages. Nearly 9500 residential buildings were affected. A great deal of damage occurred but there was no loss of life. Insurance against natural disasters is obligatory for all buildings in Iceland and they are all registered in a comprehensive property database. Therefore, after each quake a field survey was carried out where damage and repair costs were estimated for every structure. Most of the damage was observed in the near-fault area (0-10 km) but at longer distances it was significantly less. The damage in the two Mw6.5 events was considerably greater than in the Mw6.3 event. In all the events a high proportion of buildings were undamaged, even in the near-fault area. The main damage was non-structural, in interior walls and flooring. New buildings built after implementation of seismic codes performed better than those built pre-code. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

20238,"Seeimic evaluation of bridges using capacity spectrum method Capacity Spectrum Method (CSM) is a nonlinear static analysis tool in the performance-based design approach of buildings. It compares structural base shear-deformation capacity with the demand of earthquake ground motion by means of graphical representation. For the purpose of vulnerability assessment of bridges, this paper develops the nonlinear static procedure involving CSM for construction of fragility curves incorporating performance-based engineering concept. One simplified approach, alternative to the current professional design procedure given in ATC-40 (1996), is followed to reduce the seismic demand curve to account for structural nonlinearity. Seismic performance evaluation of one sample reinforced concrete bridge is carried out for sixty (60) ground acceleration time histories in Los Angeles area. Fragility curves at different damage levels such as, 'almost no', 'minor', 'moderate', 'major' and 'collapse' are developed by numerically simulating the performance displacements obtained from the intersection of the sixty reduced demand spectra and capacity spectrum.

12876,"Empirical seismic fragility for the precast RC industrial buildings damaged by the 2012 Emilia (Italy) earthquakes The paper analyses the seismic fragility of precast reinforced concrete buildings using observational damage data gathered after the 2012 Emilia earthquakes that struck Northern Italy. The damage level in 1890 buildings was collected, classified and examined. Damage matrices were then evaluated, and finally, empirical fragility curves were fitted using Bayesian regression. Building damage was classified using a six-level scale derived from EMS-98. The completeness of the database and the spatial distribution of the buildings investigated were analysed using cadastral data as a reference. The intensity of the ground motion was quantified by the maximum horizontal peak ground acceleration, which was obtained from ShakeMaps.

13346,"Seismic fragility analysis of masonry infilled reinforced concrete frame buildings in Eastern Canada In Eastern Canada, most of moment resisting reinforced concrete frames with unreinforced masonry infill (MI-MRF) buildings were constructed between 1915 and 1960. These pre-code structures, in terms of seismic requirements, are considered vulnerable to earthquake loading. The goal of this study is to provide a simplified seismic demand and fragility analysis for reliable quantification of their seismic performance under potential future seismic events. Fragility functions represent the probability of damage that corresponds to a specific seismic intensity measure (e.g. peak ground acceleration). A case study three story-three bay MI-MRF was selected to illustrate the procedure. The selected frame was proportioned with compatible characteristics of existing mid-rise frames in Quebec region. A simplified probabilistic nonlinear static procedure was applied to obtain the seismic demand model at increasing levels of seismic intensity. Pushover analysis was conducted on a nonlinear model of the frame to obtain the corresponding lateral load-deformation capacity curve. Masonry infills were modelled as an equivalent diagonal struts and the nonlinear behaviour of the reinforced concrete beams and columns were modelled with concentrated plastic hinges at members' ends. Fragility functions were then developed using an experimental based damage model that correlate the extent of damage to the displacement demand. Damage assessment using the developed functions was conducted for an earthquake scenario compatible with the design level seismic hazard in Quebec City with a 2% probability of exceedance in 50% years. The developed functions are particularly useful in probabilistic based seismic loss assessment and in planning mitigation solutions. © (2015) by the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering All rights reserved.

20589,"Seismic fragility analysis of steel building portfolios based on mathematical models Chapter 6 aims to provide a thorough procedure on how to accurately create seismic fragility curves for steel building portfolios using mathematical models. The building portfolios are restricted to l-shaped steel moment frame structures (SMFSs) located in the Central-Eastern United States (CEUS). Given the numerous l-shaped SMFSs in the CEUS, their seismic fragility needs to be assessed efficiently. Seismic fragility curves of the l-shaped SMFSs for immediate occupancy (IO), life safety (LS), and collapse prevention (CP) were created using two mathematical models, logistic and Gompertz models. Then, these curves were compared to those from Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) coupled with lognormal distribution functions, which is the most commonly used fragility model using the results of Chi-squared tests (x2). It turned out that the mathematical models attained low values of the x2 signifying high accuracy, and particularly, the Gompertz model was the most accurate model for LS and CP fragility. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

20768,"Seismic partitioned fragility analysis for high-rise RC chimney considering multidimensional ground motion In order to identify the vulnerable parts and areas of the high-rise reinforced concrete chimney, this paper presents an effective method, which called partitioned fragility analysis. One 240-m-high reinforced concrete chimney was selected as the practical project, and its analytical model was created with ABAQUS software. The selected high-rise chimney structure was divided into 17 parts, and then the damage probability of each part in different damage states was obtained with the fragility analysis considering multidimensional ground motions. Twenty ground motion records were taken from the Next Generation Attenuation database as the input motions, and the peak ground acceleration was selected as the intensity measure. The response of the chimney structure under multidimensional ground motions was obtained based on incremental dynamic analysis. The maximum strains of concrete and steel bars were defined as the damage limit states of the chimney structure. The fragility curves and surfaces obtained from this analysis showed that the vulnerable areas of the chimney structure appear at 0-20 m, 90-130 m, and 150-200 m along the height of the chimney respectively. Based analytical results, these vulnerable parts can be retrofitted to enhance the seismic resistance of existing chimney structures. And the partitioned fragility analysis method can also be used to improve the design of new chimney structures. finite element analysis  incremental dynamic analysis  multidimensional ground motion  partitioned fragility  reinforced concrete chimney  seismic performance None",Seismic partitioned fragility analysis for high-rise RC chimney considering multidimensional ground motion,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2315185788045535,0.03778135371147103,0.02239761256522237,0.01052010976600651,Analytical
18255,"How can insurers get prepared to catastrophes? Assessing earthquake expected losses from historical catalogue Countries around the world have had to face huge economic losses due to natural disasters over the past decade. This, of course represents a source of great concern for National Governments and even more so for the insurance industry. In the aftermath of a natural disaster, insurance and reinsurance markets are prone to severe insolvencies and destabilization. Therefore, the finance industry is looking for more reliable loss estimation procedures and insurance models, as effective means for resilience improvement. The present paper proposes an engineering-based methodology as a support for innovative insurance models. The study aims at defining a scientific instrument supporting insurers and reinsurers in forecasting expected losses and in mitigating the potential lack of financial capacity. This allows for catastrophe-linked modeling to be performed according to a risk-based framework. The proposed methodology is applied to the Italian residential building stock subjected to seismic risk. Expected losses are evaluated following the procedure outlined in Asprone et al. (2013) [1] for earthquake scenarios from the catalogue of historical earthquakes, of the National Institute of Volcanology and Geology (INGV) [2] and assuming present-day exposure characteristics. Hence the procedure can be implemented anywhere else a detailed catalogue collecting information about earthquakes from the past is available, as for Italy. Statistical simulations of ground motion intensity (peak ground acceleration, PGA) using multivariate normal distributions are performed for each earthquake. The simulated PGA values are calculated based on the ground motion prediction equation of Sabetta and Pugliese (1996)[3], whose coefficient are re-estimated by Bindi et al. (2009) [4], for each Italian Municipality. A set of different fragility curves from the literature has been selected and averaged for each building type, also accounting for seismic and non-seismic design. In the next step, the annual expected losses for insurers are evaluated and the results are aggregated in order to calculate total losses for the entire National building stock. Linear regression analysis is performed for predicting the expected loss as a function of earthquake magnitude. The resulting loss model can be used for efficient and rapid loss estimation for a given earthquake scenario.

19302,"On the vulnerability of low-rise residential buildings based on observations In May 2008 a shallow Mw6.3 earthquake occurred in South Iceland with its epicentre close to two small towns in the area. The maximum PGA was registered as 0.88g. A great deal of damage occurred but fortunately there was no loss of life or serious injuries. Insurance against natural disasters is obligatory for all buildings in Iceland. After the earthquake a field survey was carried out that covered every damaged structure in the affected area. The damage data was linked to the official land registry database, which contains detailed information on all buildings in Iceland. The data was used to develop probabilistic vulnerability functions and fragility curves for five types of low-rise building classes, which covers the majority of all properties in the region. Four intensity levels were used in the analysis. The damage data was classified into structural and non-structural damage categories and furthermore listed in a number of subcategories. The main findings were that these buildings have relatively good earthquake resistance and that the structural damage was low. Most of the monetary loss was related to non-structural cosmetic damage of interior walls that needed small repairs and paintwork and flooring that required replacement. © Civil-Comp Press, 2014.

20724,"Seismic fragility of RC frame-core wall structures In order to establish fragility curves of high-rise RC frame-core wall structures, nine typical RC frame-core wall structures with uniform story height, different spans and earthquake fortification intensity were designed and numerically modeled. Considering the randomness of earthquake ground motions input, their seismic responses were obtained through nonlinear dynamic time history analysis adopting the finite element software Perform-3D. Ultimate damage states of all structures were defined on the basis of current seismic design code to build the corresponding seismic fragility curves. The influences of structural span and seismic fortification intensity on structures' seismic fragility were analyzed. The results showed that low seismic fortification intensity makes no obviuos differences among structure vulnerability curves, while with increase in the intensity, the differences become obvious; although spans are divers, the fragility curves are similar under the same seismic fortification intensity; so, the design uncertainties have smaller effects on structures' seismis fragility. The results provided a reference for the seismic loss estimation of city high-rise buildings. © 2016, Editorial Office of Journal of Vibration and Shock. All right reserved.

At the first stage a probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) has been performed to extract hazard curve in CRISIS platform.

13142,"Multi-variate and single-variable flood fragility and loss approaches for buildings Propagating uncertainties in flood damage models is a critical step towards a risk-informed decision methodology that is based on quantitative assessment. Flood-related data scarcity and the use of deterministic models present challenges when seeking to include uncertainties in flood damage modeling. In this paper, a single-variable and multi-variate component-based flood fragility method is proposed. The method uses expert-based data derived from online sources that are applied within a Monte Carlo framework to divide the building into independent components and then assigns these components to five predefined damage states that describe the building damage as a whole. Using a series of Monte Carlo simulations, uncertainties in flood depth and flood duration that result in each damage level for each component were propagated. Their damage is then characterized using component fragility functions to be used to develop total building fragility and loss functions. The resulting fragilities can be used as a probabilistic vulnerability function to be assigned to a real community based on building archetype and occupancy. The ability to develop flood fragility curves for buildings without the need for empirical field data is the primary contribution of this work. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Flood loss  Flood vulnerability  Fragility function  Loss function  Resilience Buildings  Damage detection  Flood damage  Intelligent systems  Risk assessment  Uncertainty analysis  Component based  Deterministic models  Fragility curves  Fragility function  Independent components  Informed decision  Primary contribution  Quantitative assessments  Monte Carlo methods",Multi-variate and single-variable flood fragility and loss approaches for buildings,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,ML
15383,"A Study on Influential Factors on Building Damage in Kesennuma, Japan from the 2011 Great East Japan Tsunami A number of buildings were damaged by the 2011 Great East Japan tsunami in the Tohoku area. The research objective is to determine the significant predictor variables of the level of building damage. This paper used detailed data on damaged buildings in Kesennuma City, Japan, collected by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT). The tested explanatory parameters included the inundation depth, number of floors, volume of the building, debris flow, structural material, and function of the building. Through multinomial logistic regression, the results found that the number of floors was significantly associated with the damage level; the inundation depth, structural material (reinforced concrete and masonry), and function of the building (commercial facility, transportation/storage facility, and public facility) were partially associated with the damage level. This study can contribute to academic research by assessing the contribution of different variables to observed damage data by applying statistical analysis, as well as the practical contribution of providing an examination of the predominant factors driving tsunami damage to buildings. 2011 great east Japan tsunami  building damage level  multinomial logistic regression  prediction FRAGILITY CURVES  VULNERABILITY  REGRESSION","A Study on Influential Factors on Building Damage in Kesennuma, Japan from the 2011 Great East Japan Tsunami",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.083377833124923,0.2553140908742074,0.026023781360184347,0.012832087516395167,Empirical
12867,"Empirical flash flood vulnerability functions for residential buildings The estimation of flood losses is crucial for the quantitative estimation of risk and the cost–benefit analysis of risk mitigation and prevention measures. Flood losses are usually estimated by means of vulnerability functions, which are often developed in a synthetic way by experts, since loss datasets collected after events are sparse or lacking and mostly refer to slow riverine inundations. Simple univariable empirical vulnerability functions are recognized as a more valuable tool with respect to synthetic curves developed for different contexts. The aim of this work is to derive empirical vulnerability functions for a flash flood event which occurred in Livorno (Italy) in September 2017, based on the hydrologic–hydraulic reconstruction of the flood and observed losses to residential properties. The hydrologic processes are reproduced with a distributed hydrologic model, and the flood propagation is simulated with a full 2D model. Many open GIS data are used and combined with virtual on-site inspection in the study area to analyze building exposure. Different regression curves are tested to fit the data and obtain damage curves. The results show (i) a poor correlation between relative or absolute losses and flow velocity, (ii) a low correlation between relative losses and water depth, thus confirming the existing literature. More significant correlation is found between absolute losses and water depths. The curves here derived provide a first attempt to develop damage functions for flash flood in Italy, which could be applied in similar urban and morphologic contexts. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

17330,"Empirical building fragilities from observed damage in the 2009 South Pacific tsunami This manuscript presents empirical building fragility functions that were developed based on data obtained from the 29th September 2009 South Pacific tsunami. A multi-disciplinary reconnaissance team involving topographic surveyors, tsunami/hydrology modellers, structural engineers, and risk analysts collected observational and quantitative data on building damage and the tsunami demand. A diverse range of collected data, which included a topographic survey, observed water depths, predominant flow directions, inundation limits, building damage, and eyewitness reports, were used to recreate the peak tsunami-induced demands on structures at each of the survey locations. Using the interpreted data, fragility functions were developed for a variety of building classes using logistic regression. It was observed that residential timber structures were more fragile (i.e. have a higher likelihood of damage for a given water depth) than masonry residential structures for severe and collapse damage states. Conversely, residential reinforced concrete structures were observed to be less fragile than residential masonry structures for severe and collapse damage states. The influence of â€˜shieldingâ€™ and â€˜entrained debrisâ€™ effects on fragility functions were also quantified using the empirical data. Other parameters such as velocity or impact duration were not considered due to the paucity of data.

This includes the development of seismic fragility functions for commonly employed building systems.

21049,"Seismic robustness assessment of steel moment resisting frames employing material uncertainty incorporated incremental dynamic analysis Seismic robustness can be a useful tool to evaluate the structural system capacity to withstand seismic damages. Robust structures can minimize their vulnerability to the progression of damages (extensive) and thereby prevent or avert the collapse risk in the event of seismic shocks. Neglecting the effect of topology, the structural robustness can be reduced to the function of seismic record and material properties. It can be taken as the ratio of mean annual frequency of exceeding a given limit state of interest considering record variability alone and the mean annual frequency of exceeding the given limit state of interest incorporating record as well as material uncertainty. The present study attempts to quantify the seismic robustness of 4-storey and 8-storey moment-resisting frames in terms of the above two mean annual frequency of exceeding the given limit state of interest. Based on the past research reports, a 10% Inter-storey Drift Ratio, IDR where transient drift is competent to permanent drift is considered as the collapse limit state of interest for the investigation.

15632,"Analytical Fragility Function for Seismic Damage Evaluation of Unreinforced Masonry Buildings in High Seismic Zone The paper describes the evaluation of seismic capacity of the unreinforced masonry building in the high seismic zone by an analytical procedure, based on nonlinear static approach. In this procedure, each wall plane is modeled as some vertical strip walls separated by the openings and is characterized by two primary components such as vertical component pier and horizontal component spandrel. These walls are analysed considering the capacity of pier in conjunction with the coupling effect between pier and spandrel. However, capacity of spandrel is not considered in this case. The shear capacity of the wall is calculated based on lower bound theorem of plasticity without considering the tensile strength of masonry. Capacity curves of the walls are determined by three parameters as shear capacity, yield displacement and ultimate displacement at zero stiffness approaching a bilinear approximation and these capacity curves of the walls in a certain orthogonal direction are superposed to obtain capacity curve of the building in that direction. The smaller capacity of the building in the prevalent direction is then compared with seismic demand and a capacity-demand relationship is found and damages are introduced in this capacity-demand relationship to obtain vulnerability function. The vulnerability function of the representative masonry building models are used to construct fragility function of the building group and this fragility function shows the expected damage of the building group as a function of spectral displacement.

19354,"Out-of-Plane fragility of In-Plane damaged unreinforced masonry infills in low rise reinforced concrete buildings Unreinforced masonry (URM) is commonly used to make infill walls in reinforced concrete (RC) frame buildings. Such infill walls are highly vulnerable to out-of-plane (OOP) seismic loading and this can result in huge economic losses and human casualties. Therefore, fragility assessment of URM infill walls under seismic loads is important in view of performing large-scale risk analysis. In this paper, OOP fragility functions are provided based on a numerical investigation supported by a macro-element model. The fragility is calculated assuming the uncertainty in the geometric and mechanical properties of infills instead of the variability in the seismic input. Further, the effect of in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) interaction is taken into account. Finally, the sensitivity of the results to the infill position in low rise buildings is discussed. Experimental data available in the literature are used for the validation of the output. Overall, the results indicated lower vulnerability in the OOP direction for infill walls without IP damage and high vulnerability in the OOP direction in the presence of previous IP damage. The vulnerability was found also increasingly proportional to the positioning of the panels at higher floors where the spectral acceleration of the structure is higher too. The proposed procedure can be extended to other types of infill walls depending on the construction technique of the site of interest, obtaining different and specific fragility curves for large-scale risk analysis. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

21090,"Seismic vulnerability and risk analysis of the old building stock at urban scale: application to a neighbourhood in Lisbon The old buildings represent an important fraction of the urban fabric of the cities, which have implicit societal issues, like safety. This work deals with the seismic vulnerability assessment and risk analysis of the old building stock, with application to a neighbourhood in Lisbon. The studied neighbourhood includes three frequent building typologies in Portugal, i.e. stone masonry, “Placa” and RC buildings. Reference buildings for each typology were numerically modelled using the equivalent frame method. Pushover analysis was then performed to derive the vulnerability characteristics of the reference buildings and more general building classes, i.e. capacity and fragility curves, in order to assess the seismic vulnerability of the buildings and perform a seismic risk analysis. This last analysis was performed to estimate the building damages and the economic and life losses for different earthquake scenarios. Most of the studied buildings are found to be unsafe to the considered seismic actions and will suffer severe damages with associated large losses. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

19619,"Potential seismic damage assessment of residential buildings in Imzouren City (Northern Morocco) The main purpose of this study is to assess seismic risk and present earthquake loss scenarios for the city of Imzouren, in northern Morocco. An empirical approach was chosen to assess the seismic vulnerability of the existing buildings, using the Vulnerability Index Method (RISK-UE), and considering two earthquake scenarios (deterministic and probabilistic). Special concern was given to the seismic vulnerability in Imzouren since the 2004 earthquake (24 February, mw = 6.4) that struck the region and caused substantial damage. A site investigation was conducted in the city targeting more than 3000 residential buildings, which had been closely examined and catalogued to assess their seismic vulnerability. The results of the seismic risk assessment in the city are represented through damage to the buildings, harm to the population and economic loss. Generally, the results obtained from the deterministic approach are in agreement with the damage caused by the 2004 earthquake. © 2018 by the authors.

17347,"Empirical fragility curves for masonry buildings after the 2009 L’Aquila, Italy, earthquake This study focuses on the seismic vulnerability of masonry buildings damaged by the 2009 L’Aquila earthquake. A geo-referenced database of 32,520 masonry residential buildings was compiled in the aftermath of the earthquake under the coordination of the Italian Department of Civil Protection through the AeDES survey form. The availability of this enormous amount of data provides an exceptional opportunity to examine in depth damage data and their correlation with the main parameters available from the post-earthquake survey. The original database was grouped into 20 building classes, defined as a function of vertical and horizontal structural types. Damage levels defined according to the European Macroseismic Scale classification are used to derive damage probability matrices and relevant vulnerability curves for these classes. The influences of connection systems, the quality/regularity of the masonry wall layout and the horizontal structural type on the building response are analysed in detail. A vulnerability classification, also supported by the use of statistical post hoc tests, is used to detect a reduced number of independent classes. The parameters of the non-crossing fragility curves are determined via the maximum likelihood estimation method by adopting a lognormal cumulative function to determine the exceedance probabilities of the considered damage levels. The impact of “mixed” classes, characterized by multiple vertical and/or horizontal structural types, on the derivation of the fragility curves is also investigated. Finally, the adaptation of the general version of the fragility curves to large-scale applications based on poor (census) data is also demonstrated, leading to curves that are easily usable in regional/national seismic loss assessments. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

12788,"Development of damage functions for flood risk assessment in the city of Colombo (Sri Lanka) Depth vs. damage curves were developed for a flood risk assessment carried out in Colombo, Sri Lanka. The major elements of the damage assessment comprised building fabrics, building contents, distributed infrastructure and vehicles. Current approaches to damage function development were improved on by separating damage to building fabric and contents; using actual building footprints rather than assigning building functions to city zones; assessing infrastructure damage accurately; and incorporating damage to vehicles. Information sources included infrastructure agencies, bills of quantities for buildings, expert consultations, household surveys and insurance agencies. The building fabric was assigned three categories, namely semi-permanent, single storey and two storey. The building contents were classified into 7 types based on function as warehouse/storage, industrial, shops, offices, residential, educational and health. The proportion of contents asset values to that of the fabric ranged from 1.67 for warehouse/storage to 0.20for educational. Both 'what-if' analyses and historic data were used to generate the curves. Data were obtained as losses per unit area or unit length; or as point losses.For the 140 square km urban area, the generated flood damages ranged from USD 37 to 549 million for return periods from 5 to 100 years, with average inundation depths ranging from 0.48 m to 1.28 m (and outliers up to 5.8 m). The total non-residential to residential building damage increased with return period (and together accounted for 75-85% of damage). The residential contents to fabric damage ratio was generally around 1.5. The percentage damage to infrastructure was not very significant, although that to vehicles was, especially at lower return periods. © 2018 The Authors.

20231,"Scenario-based seismic loss estimation for concrete buildings in the central US This paper focuses on the estimation of economic losses related to structural damage for concrete frame structures due to seismic events. A scenario-based assessment is conducted for moderate to high intensity earthquakes in the Central U.S. The scenario earthquakes under consideration have three magnitudes (5.5, 6.5, and 7.5) and Shelby County, Tennessee, is selected as the case study area. The buildings considered are typical Reinforced Concrete (RC) moment frame buildings in this region. Fragility curves developed using story-specific demand models are used to represent seismic vulnerability of the buildings. The structural damage of the selected buildings is assessed with a probabilistic approach that uses empirical structural damage factors and accounts for the prevailing uncertainties. Finally, these inputs are implemented into MAEviz, the seismic loss assessment software developed by the Mid-America Earthquake Center, and the structural losses for the concrete frame buildings are estimated. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

22286,"What are the uncertainties when calculating flood damage potentials? [Wie groß Sind die Unsicherheiten bei der Schadenspotenzialermittlung Infolge Überschwemmung?] The EU flood directive requires Member States to draw up flood risk maps by 2013. After defining the probability of occurrence of a flood event, the damage potentials have to be quantified. The damage resulting from flooding is relevant to people, buildings, Infrastructure, companies, ecological and cultural goods and can be divided up into economic, ecological and psychosocial damages. Compared to ecological and psychosocial damages the damage assessment of economic damages is much more developed, but there is still a lack in data of the existing models, which leads to uncertainties of the model outputs when calculating the damages. Although the quantification of the uncertainties is important information when calculating the absolute damage in monetary terms and deciding whether to implement a mitigation measure within the risk management, the uncertainties are not considered yet in the damage models.

19646,"Predictive model for seismic vulnerability assessment of churches based on the 2009 L’Aquila earthquake Seismic events that struck Italy in the last years had a dramatic impact on historical and cultural heritage. Damage occurred on existing masonry buildings, in particular on churches, stressed out the need to better understand the seismic behaviour of this type of constructions as well as to define more appropriate mitigation strategies to be applied at large scale. This study deals with a predictive methodology for vulnerability assessment of churches in large territorial areas. Focusing the attention on three naves churches of Abruzzi, the paper proposes modifications and integrations of an existing methodology taken by literature. These modifications are defined through a calibration procedure based on damage observation of 64 three naves churches located at different distances from the epicentre of the 2009 earthquake. The proposed model is employed to predict damage level distribution for different earthquake intensities, allowing fragility curves to be plotted and therefore potential damage scenarios to be represented. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

20014,"Re-evaluation of building damage during recent earthquakes in Turkey Over the past two decades Turkey has been hit by several moderate to large earthquakes that resulted in significant loss of life and property. A remarkable number of casualties and heavily damaged or collapsed buildings has emphasized inadequate seismic performance of multistory reinforced concrete buildings, typically three to seven stories in height. This study aims to evaluate seismic performance of the most common reinforced concrete building stock in Turkey considering nonlinear behavior of the components. A sample building set is selected to reflect existing construction practice; regular buildings and buildings with irregularities such as soft story, heavy overhangs, short columns, and soft story with heavy overhangs. Ductile and non-ductile details are taken into account by transverse reinforcement amount. Capacity curves of the investigated building set are determined by pushover analyses conducted in two principal directions. The inelastic dynamic characteristics are represented by equivalent single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) systems. Their seismic displacement demands are determined using nonlinear response history analysis under selected ground motions. Seismic performance evaluation is carried out in accordance with the recently published Turkish Earthquake Code (2006) that has similarities with FEMA-356 guidelines. Analytical damage evaluation in this study has shown that the seismic effects of earthquakes experienced in Turkey are significant and some of the earthquakes impose excessive displacement demands. Therefore, a considerable portion of existing building stock may not be safe enough in Turkey or similar countries. Also, it is observed that structural irregularities affect seismic performance of buildings. Short columns and soft story with heavy overhangs have the most negative effect.

16667,"Damage models for extreme flood events - Part 2: Preliminary conclusions from the event in June 2013 The 2013 flood event caused severe damage again in the areas affected by the 2002 flood. Based on a damage documentation along the river basin of Vereinigte Mulde and Zwickauer Mulde, and therefore concentrated on the most affected areas during the flood in Saxony, some preliminary conclusions are drawn about the impact of two extreme floods on a repeated affected building stock. The evaluation of the observed damages allows a further plausibility of the flood damage model which was developed at the Earthquake Damage Analysis Center (EDAC) at the Bauhaus-Universitat Weimar. In the study areas Dobeln, Eilenburg and Grimma in Saxony, already affected by the 2002 flood, the observed damages and the flood heights are documented. Newly developed vulnerability and damage functions enable the prediction of the damages and losses, which can be correlated later with the official reported losses. The effects of recovery measures after the 2002 flood on the vulnerability of the building stock are highlighted and the resulting changes are taken into account differentiated by the prediction of the losses. flood damage  damage documentation  damage cases  vulnerability assessment  loss prognosis None",Damage models for extreme flood events - Part 2: Preliminary conclusions from the event in June 2013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06637629291406548,0.24925140337132523,0.05971918530673197,0.0260296789429218,Empirical
17351,Empirical fragility curves for Peruvian school buildings This paper describes an estimation of economic losses in Peruvian educational buildings for different levels of seismic action. Opinions of experts were processed to generate seismic intensity versus damage relationships. Economic losses were then expressed through fragility curves and damage matrices. For frequent earthquakes (50-year return period) a 50 loss would be expected in adobe buildings and 20 loss in confined masonry structures built before 1997. During severe earthquakes (500-year return period) only confined masonry structures built after 1997 would be repairable at a cost of around 40 of their original cost. 1997 Peruvian seismic code  Damage matrices  Fragility curves  Seismic lose  Types of Peruvian school buildings Buildings  Damage detection  Masonry construction  Seismic response  Damage matrices  Fragility curves  Seismic lose  Earthquake effects  building  earthquake damage  empirical analysis  seismic attenuation,Empirical fragility curves for Peruvian school buildings,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06644385813601719,0.31305285172369646,0.061310386916409464,0.003721864118349014,Empirical
16919,"Development of medium- and low-rise reinforced concrete building fragility curves based on Chi-Chi Earthquake data In this paper, a grid-based cluster division procedure, in combination with a novel maximum likelihood estimate based on multinomial distribution, is proposed to derive fragility curves for medium- and low-rise reinforced concrete (RC) buildings in Taiwan. This new grid-based method generates higher-quality vulnerability data for reducing the dispersion of datasets than does the district-based method. The medium- and low-rise RC buildings are classified into six typologies according to both the number of floors and the design code, based on the complete building damage records collected after the 1999 Chi-Chi Earthquake in Taiwan. The results of the grid-based method show that the fragility curves are more stable and convergent than those from the district-based method. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method can reasonably be implemented for fragility analysis and can be used for assessing seismic risk in the future. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

21927,"Time-dependent seismic performance assessment of a single-degree-of-freedom frame subject to corrosion Corrosion of reinforcement bars in concrete is directly responsible for serious damage to concrete structures, which may result in premature failure of the structures as a function of time. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate its damage on the structural performance level. Many models have been developed to predict the corrosion rate of steel in concrete and its effects on structures. It is also possible to evaluate and identify the seismic performance level of reinforced concrete (RC) structures. This study contributes to an understanding of the relationship between these two topics as a function of time to predict the performance level of corroded RC buildings. Three combined parameters (loss of the cross sectional area of reinforcement bars, reduction of the concrete strength, and additional displacement due to slip) as a consequence of corrosion effects were calculated as a function of the corrosion rate for five different time periods (i.e., non-corroded (t: 0), 25, 50, 75, and 100years). Obtained results were used to perform nonlinear time-history analyses for 20 ground motion records. The results showed that the effect of the corrosion of steel on the seismic performance level is highly significant, and it should be considered carefully in performance analysis.

17252,"Effectiveness of base-isolated low-rise masonry building under excitation from earthquakes Low-rise masonry building is one of the most commonly adopted structural types even in earthquake prone regions in developing countries. The building is generally susceptible to damage due to earthquake induced motion and may suffer partial or total collapse. Un-bonded fiber reinforced elastomeric isolator (U-FREI) is a relatively new seismic base isolator and is expected to be an attractive option for seismic mitigation of low-rise buildings. In this paper, the effectiveness of a base-isolated masonry building supported on U-FREls subjected to earthquakes is investigated by finite element (FE) analysis using SAP2000. The prototype building is a two-storey masonry building located at Tawang, Arunachal Pradesh State, India and is the first such U-FREls supported prototype low-rise building constructed anywhere in the world. Mechanical characteristics of U-FREls obtained from both experiments and FE analysis are utilized in defining the nonlinear property of the model used for simulating U-FREls. The force-deformation behaviour of the isolator is modelled as bi-linear hysteretic behaviour, which can be effectively used to model all isolation system in practice. Time history analysis of the building for both fixed-base (FB) and base-isolated (BI) conditions under the action of various recorded real earthquakes are investigated. Comparison of the dynamic response of both FB and BI buildings is computed to evaluate the effectiveness of the base isolation system. The FE analysis results show that floor acceleration and inter-storey drift responses of the BI building under earthquakes are significantly lesser than those of the FB building. U-FREls are recommended for seismic isolation of low-rise masonry building. masonry building  base isolation  seismic isolation technology  seismic vulnerability  fiber reinforced elastomeric isolator  floor acceleration response  inter-storey drift response  earthquake HOMOGENIZED LIMIT ANALYSIS  RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS  FRAGILITY CURVES  BRICK MASONRY  SHAKE TABLE  PERFORMANCE  BRIDGES",Effectiveness of base-isolated low-rise masonry building under excitation from earthquakes,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4065267619420466,0.02212459033254696,0.044260192510874034,0.03693743090753135,Analytical
22009,"Tsunami loss assessment based on Hazus approach â€“ The Bat Galim, Israel, case study The extensive loss of human lives and building damage sustained during past tsunamis drove development of the first tsunami risk assessment in Israel. Although past tsunamis have occurred along the eastern Mediterranean coasts, no data is available for empirical hazard and risk analysis. Thus, our assessment focused on a simulated tsunami generated by an Mw 8.2 earthquake along the eastern Cypriot Arc (about 200 km NW of Haifa) in Bat Galim, the most vulnerable neighborhood in the city of Haifa, situated along the Mediterranean coast in northern Israel. This tsunami event represents the worst-case scenario threatening Bat Galim. Exposure data were taken from the National Archives of the Survey of Israel and was verified with a field survey. Two approaches were taken to derive the most appropriate vulnerability models for the study: first, already published Damage Criteria (DC) were developed based on information from past tsunami events around the world; second, damage functions were applied using the Hazus Tsunami Model (HTM), a multi-parameter loss estimation tool built using detailed engineering knowledge. Risk was considered the product of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. Following several parametric studies and sensitivity tests, we produced loss assessment results from the two most realistic model outcomes and arrived at conclusions meaningful for tsunami preparedness in northern Israel. Most importantly, we note that the loss of life far surpasses building damage. Increasing community preparedness is the simplest and most cost-effective way to significantly reduce the risk of casualties during a tsunami. We also note that upgrading the seismic design of existing structures according to required standards in Israel will decrease vulnerability to tsunamis and expand possibilities for vertical evacuation. We discuss the accuracy and reliability of our analysis and demonstrate that a simple DC approach is useful for preliminary investigation in cases of limited data. The HTM however, requires detailed preparation and data inputs but produces more realistic loss estimates. These insights may aid others during future implementation of tsunami loss modeling in threatened coastal communities. Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Damage assessment and risk analysis are important issues for risk management and hazard mitigation.

This paper focuses on the use of spatial data for capture of spatial characteristics of damage in natural calamities. Because it affects a large number of persons and families, flood damages in the residential area usually attract major attentions in regional flood hazard management.

18426,"Incremental Dynamic Analysis and Pushover Analysis of Buildings. A Probabilistic Comparison Capacity-spectrum-based-methods are also used for assessing the vulnerability and risk of existing buildings. Capacity curves are usually obtained by means of nonlinear static analysis. Incremental Dynamic Analysis is another powerful tool based on nonlinear dynamic analysis. This method is similar to the pushover analysis as the input is increasingly enlarged but it is different as it is based on dynamic analysis. Moreover, it is well known that the randomness associated to the structural response can be significant, because of the uncertainties involved in the mechanical properties of the materials, among other uncertainty sources, and because the expected seismic actions are also highly stochastic. Selected mechanical properties are considered as random variables and the seismic hazard is considered in a probabilistic way. A number of accelerograms of actual European seismic events have been selected in such a way that their response spectra fit well the response spectra provided by the seismic codes for the zone where the target building is constructed. In this work a fully probabilistic approach is tackled by means of Monte Carlo simulation. The method is applied to a detailed study of the seismic response of a reinforced concrete building. The building is representative for office buildings in Spain but the procedures used and the results obtained can be extended to other types of buildings. The main purposes of this work are (1) to analyze the differences when static and dynamic techniques are used and (2) to obtain a measure of the uncertainties involved in the assessment of the vulnerability of structures. The results show that static based procedures are somehow conservative and that uncertainties increase with the severity of the seismic actions and with the damage. Low damage state fragility curves have little uncertainty while high damage grades fragility curves show great scattering. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

20720,"Seismic fragility of open ground story buildings in India 'Open ground storey' (OGS) framed buildings are very common in urban areas in countries like India. In design practice, the influence of the infill stiffness in the upper stories of the building is usually ignored, and unless the ground storey columns are specially designed for enhanced bending moments and shear forces, OGS framed buildings is seismically vulnerable due to vertical irregularity. In this study, the seismic fragility of existing OGS buildings in India are evaluated and compared with the corresponding fragility curves for building frames without infill (bare frames) and with full infill in all storeys. The inter-storey drift at the ground storey is treated as the demand variable using a power law model, considering a soft-storey failure mechanism. A regression analysis is performed to estimate the parameters of the demand model, from the peak responses estimated from nonlinear dynamic analyses of OGS buildings using an ensemble of 30 ground motions that represent the seismicity of the region. The probability distributions of the capacities are assumed to be lognormal. The OGS frames are found to be significantly more fragile compared to the fully infilled frames at all limit states, and in general, the fragility increases with increase in number of storeys, but decreases when a large number of bays are involved.

18151,"Gaussian process regression for seismic fragility assessment of building portfolios Seismic fragility assessment of building portfolios is often based on the analysis of “average” building models representative of structural types (or building classes), thus neglecting building-to-building variability within a structural type. This paper proposes the use of Gaussian process (GP) regressions to develop flexible and accurate metamodels explicitly mapping building-class attributes to the seismic fragility parameters. The proposed metamodels can enable analysts to account for building-to-building variability in simulation-based seismic risk assessment of building portfolios. Unlike other commonly-used metamodels, GP regressions do not require the a-priori definition of a prediction function and they quantify the uncertainty on the predictions in a refined and explicit fashion. The proposed method is demonstrated for a portfolio of seismically-deficient reinforced concrete school buildings with construction details typical of some developing countries. Based on the available information about the building attributes (e.g. geometry, materials, detailing), building realisations are generated based on two alternative approaches, which are critically compared: design of experiment and Monte Carlo sampling. Cloud-based time-history analysis for each building realisation is performed using unscaled real ground-motion records; fragility relationships are derived for four structure-specific damage states. A GP regression is then developed for each considered fragility parameter (i.e. median and dispersion). To further increase the tractability and scalability of the methodology, alternative metamodels are defined based on numerical non-linear static pushover analyses or analytical “by-hand” pushover analyses, through the Simple Lateral Mechanism Analysis (SLaMA) method. The results show that, for the considered portfolio, the fitted GP regressions have a high predictive power in surrogating the modelled fragility, demonstrating the feasibility of the approach in practice. It is also shown that the choice of the sampling technique could be based on the input data availability, rather than on the expected computational burden. Finally, the use of simplified methods for response analysis shows acceptable error levels with respect to the full time-history analysis results. Such simplified methods can be promising alternatives to generate large training datasets for the proposed GP regressions. This increases the potential of training metamodels in practical portfolio risk assessment applications, in which a high number of building types, each characterised by a large number of attributes, is generally involved.

20461,"Seismic damage evaluation of unreinforced masonry buildings in high seismic zone using the nonlinear static method Seismotectonic features of northeast India signify a very high probabilit of occurrence of major earthquake in future. However, a considerable portion of the building stock of this region is unreinforced masonry buildings. These buildings possess very little displacement capacity and consequently a devastating effect maybe observed during a future earthquake. Therefore, potential seismic evaluation of unreinforced masonry buildings in these areas is very essential in order to implement any kind of seismic hazard mitigation strategy. In this study, seismic evaluation of representative masonry building models is carried out by performing pushover analysis using available computer program SAP2000. In this method the masonry walls are modeled as equivalent frame made of vertical (pier) and horizontal (spandrels) elements with rigid intersecting joint elements and lumped plastic hinge concept. The model simulates nonlinear in-plane behaviour of the wall panels. The shear failure of spandrel is addressed by shear hinge at the middle and acombined failure of pier is addressed by two P-M interaction hinges at either end of the pier. However, combined failure is governed by the minimum failure envelopeof P-M interaction curves to ensure the effect of vertical load on the failure of pier. Lastly, fragility curves which express the expected damage as a function of spectraldisplacement were developed based on the capacity curve. © Springer India 2015.

17971,"Fragility assessment of RC-MRFs under concurrent vertical-horizontal seismic action effects In this study, structural vulnerability of reinforced concrete moment resisting frames (RC-MRFs) by considering the Iran-specific characteristics is investigated to manage the earthquake risk in terms of multicomponent seismic excitations. Low and medium rise RC-MRFs, which constitute approximately 80-90% of the total buildings stock in Iran, are focused in this fragility-based assessment. The seismic design of 3-12 story RC-MRFs are carried out according to the Iranian Code of Practice for Seismic Resistant Design of Buildings (Standard No. 2800), and the analytical models are formed accordingly in open source nonlinear platforms. Frame structures are categorized in three subclasses according to the specific characteristics of construction practice and the observed seismic performance after major earthquakes in Iran. Both far and near fields' ground motions have been considered in the fragility estimation. An optimal intensity measure (IM) called Sa, avg and beta probability distribution were used to obtain reliable fragility-based database for earthquake damage and loss estimation of RC buildings stock in urban areas of Iran. Nonlinear incremental dynamic analyses by means of lumped-parameter based structural models have been simulated and performed to extract the fragility curves. Approximate confidence bounds are developed to represent the epistemic uncertainties inherent in the fragility estimations. Consequently, it's shown that including vertical ground motion in the analysis is highly recommended for reliable seismic assessment of RC buildings. Copyright © 2015 Techno-Press, Ltd.

21260,"Seismic Vulnerability Scenarios for Timisoara, Romania Romania is an European country with two major seismic zones, Vrancea and Banat. Timisoara is one of the biggest cities in Romania, located in Banat seismic area, characterized by shallow earthquakes, with depths between 2 and 20Â km and important vertical forces. In the historical area of Timisoara there were classified different types of structures, using the HAZUS method (HAZUS 1999). Seismic vulnerability analysis was done using different methodologies, Vulnerability Index, Tremuri, Vulnus and the Romanian methodology according to code P100-3/2013 in order to assess the behavior of historical buildings.Â Based on the results obtained after applying the three methodologies, there will be further made fragility curves for buildings located in the 3 historic zones of Timisoara city. In particular the probability to have in-plane or out-of-plane damages obtained by Vulnus is correlated with the results of the nonlinear analysis made with Tremuri software considering different limit state. Subsequently, considering the typical earthquakes in Banat area, it was possible to define the seismic response for three buildings, as a preview of seismic response of the city and the impact of the earthquake. This type of analysis was made for the most frequent earthquake type. This article makes plain the first step in estimating the hazard seismic scenarios for the evaluation of the losses in terms of human life and financial problems, offering the support for further prevention and intervention strategies. © 2019, RILEM.

17063,"Earthquake and Tsunami Resiliency Assessment for a Coastal Community in the Pacific Northwest, USA In this paper we examine and compare the vulnerabilities of building and highway bridge to the combined effect of earthquake and tsunami loading. Earthquake-induced ground shaking, ground failure (e.g., landslides and liquefaction), and tsunami inundation fragility functions are combined with regional hazard data to estimate the damage and direct economic loss of building and bridge. We use the city of Seaside, Oregon, as a case study site, because it is one of the most vulnerable coastal cities in the Pacific North United States given the threat of an extreme nearfield Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake and resulting tsunami. We test sensitivity of damage levels using various fragility curves. For the fragility curve analysis, we consider flow depth, velocity and momentum flux ad the intensity measure to estimate the probability of a certain damage level based on the known structure type and characteristic tsunami and earthquake intensity. We also evaluate the disaster resilience. The results indicate that when ground failure and tsunami inundation are considered, there is an overwhelming increase in the loss estimates when compared to the estimates obtained when ground shaking alone is considered. © ASCE.

15636,"Analytical seismic fragility analysis of existing building frame in Northeast India The analytical seismic fragility analysis (SFA) of a typical mid-rise steel building frame considered to be located in the Guwahati city of Northeast India is presented in the performance-based earthquake engineering (PBEE) framework. The approach starts with a detailed probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) of the Guwahati city to obtain hazard curve parameters. Subsequently, nonlinear time history analyses (NLTHA) are carried out to obtain displacement demand model parameters for the example frame. For dynamic analysis, a representative ground motion bin is prepared judiciously. As the recorded accelerograms in the region is limited, the bin is formed with recorded as well as artificially and synthetically generated data. The structural capacities at various limit states are obtained from random pushover analysis (RPA). With the estimated seismic hazard, demand and capacity parameters, fragility curves are generated for different performance levels. The annual probability of failure is finally estimated based on the seismic hazard and the fragility curves. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

15346,"A simplified method for seismic assessment of unreinforced masonry buildings The paper presents a simplified vulnerability assessment method for unreinforced masonry buildings based on the evaluation of a few structural parameters, which can be determined from visual inspection and a geometry survey. The authors proposed an empirical approach with the aim to assess the in-plane vulnerability quickly by predicting the damage failure of bearing masonry walls. Field observations reveal different behaviours: out-of-plane and in-plane seismic responses. Several simplified assessments focus on out-of-plane behaviour. Few studies deal with in-plane seismic behaviour, which is also the expected response for more masonry buildings. The proposed seismic method provides a vulnerability index, which is evaluated as the weighted sum of 10 parameters markedly affecting the in-plane seismic performance. The reliability of the method is investigated through an application on buildings located in Central Italy, damaged by the 2016 earthquake. The mean damage and damage probability distributions were predicted for each building using the proposed method. Then, fragility functions were estimated from the results of non-linear static analysis, and the damage probability distributions were derived. The capability of the simplified method to foresee the damage probabilities was confirmed by a comparison between different approaches, confirming the reliability of the method in large-scale seismic assessment. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. damage probability distributions  mean damage curves  unreinforced masonry buildings  Vulnerability assessment Damage detection  Masonry construction  Masonry materials  Seismic response  Walls (structural partitions)  Damage curves  Damage probability  Damage probability distribution  Mean damage curve  Out-of-plane  Probability: distributions  Seismic assessment  Simplified method  Unreinforced masonry building  Vulnerability assessments  Probability distributions  building  earthquake damage  earthquake engineering  masonry  seismic response  vulnerability  Italy",A simplified method for seismic assessment of unreinforced masonry buildings,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16855484050960956,0.09882188175044065,0.029910441044545346,0.006057992516428962,Analytical

Fourteen representative real ground motion records were scaled and used to assess the potential seismic structural risk of the model buildings. Time history analyses were performed on the 13 model buildings and fragility curves relating the probability of reaching or exceeding four predefined damage states to peak ground acceleration (PGA) were established for the 13 model building types. The fragility curves were then used to assess the structural risk of the model buildings and estimate the associated human and economic losses for various earthquake scenarios.

16854,"Development and evaluation of FLFAcs – A new Flood Loss Function for Australian commercial structures Commercial building flood losses significantly affect the Australian economy; however, there are not many models for commercial flood damage estimation and their results are not reliable. This study has attempted to derive and develop a new model (FLFAcs) for estimating the magnitude of direct damage on commercial structures. The FLFAcs – Flood Loss Function for Australian commercial structures, was calibrated using empirical data collected from the 2013 flood in Bundaberg, Australia, and considering the inherent uncertainty in the data sample. In addition, the newly derived model has been validated using a K-fold cross-validation procedure. The model performance has also been compared with the Flood Loss Estimation MOdel for the commercial sector (FLEMOcs) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) damage functions from overseas, as well as the ANUFLOOD damage model from Australia. The validation procedure shows very good results for FLFAcs performance (no bias and only five per cent mean absolute error). It also shows that ANUFLOOD, as Australia’s most prevalently used commercial loss estimation model, is still subject to very high uncertainty. Hence, there is an immediate need for a project to build new depth–damage functions for commercial and industrial properties. Awareness of these issues is important for strategic decision-making in flood risk reduction and it could amplify the cognition of decision-makers and insurance companies about flood risk assessment in Australia.

19829,"Progressive collapse fragility models of European reinforced concrete framed buildings based on pushdown analysis Structural safety for extreme loads that may cause local damage to single primary components or even the progressive collapse of the structure has been probabilistically assessed in a few studies, hence neglecting uncertainties in loads and system capacity. As such, this paper moves from a deterministic to a probabilistic framework, proposing new progressive collapse fragility models based on pushdown analysis of low-rise, reinforced concrete framed bare structures. Two building classes representative of structures designed for either gravity loads or earthquake resistance in accordance with current European codes were investigated. Monte Carlo simulation was used to generate random realizations of 2D and 3D structural models. Fiber-based finite element models were developed within an open source platform. The primary output consisted of fragility functions for each damage state of interest, given the loss of corner column at the ground floor. The fragility models were compared to those derived through incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) to assess the inaccuracy of progressive collapse fragility functions derived through pushdown analysis. Load capacity predictions provided by those analysis methods were used to develop regression models for a quick estimation of dynamic amplification factor at a given displacement/drift level. The analysis results show a significant influence of both seismic design and secondary beams on robustness of the case-study building classes.

13218,"Probabilistic depth-damage curves for assessment of flood-induced building losses The most common and internationally accepted method of assessing building damage due to flooding is through the application of a depth-damage curve (DDC). A DDC relates the percent damage or estimated economic loss to a buildings' structural integrity and/or contents directly to a given water level (depth). The DDC generally represents an average structure within a given building category, e.g. one-storey single-family residence. Given the great variability across any given structural category, the variation in building materials, construction quality across communities and the singular focus on depth for estimation of losses, it is important to communicate the uncertainty and potential variability of the expected losses in any assessment. In this paper, probabilistic depth-damage curves (PDDCs) are developed based on synthetically derived DDCs from communities in southern Ontario. The generated PDDCs are based on assumed loss thresholds for minor and major loss levels, as spent in Canadian dollars. The economic loss estimates obtained in this way and their likelihood of being exceeded at any given flood depth express more transparently the potential building losses. An applied example of this method is included for both aggregate and building-by-building loss estimation.

15105,"A Decision-Making Framework Integrating Fluid and Solid Systems to Assess Resilience of Coastal Communities Experiencing Extreme Storm Events The precise assessment of flood damage and structural resiliency is of the utmost importance for coastal communities, mitigating risk from repeated extreme storm events. However, most flood resiliency studies have been criticized for lack of accuracy and failing to depict the relationships among the hydrodynamics, structural characteristics, and community preparedness. This work intends to present an inclusive approach for quantifying community-scale flood damage and structural resiliency. Large-scale coastal flooding has been simulated and validated with semi-coupled storm surge and 2D inundation models. The depth and momentum components of flood flow were integrated with a newly developed multidimensional flood-damage assessment model, which includes the traditional depth–damage relationship as well as building height, age, configuration, and construction material to calculate the resiliency of structures as a function of recovery time, community preparedness, and level of flood-induced damage. The study region experienced flood depths ranging from 4.91 m to 8.06 m from various hurricane categories with 28.69%, 45.62%, and 92.13% damage to properties. The flood damage and resiliency results were presented via geospatial analytics at property level (i.e., microscale) and aggregated census block group (i.e., macroscale) levels, indicating the developed framework's universal applicability and scalability. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd Disaster recovery  Flood damage  Flood resiliency  Hydrodynamic modeling  Resilience Restorative Curves Building materials  Damage detection  Decision making  Hydrodynamics  Risk assessment  Storms  Coastal communities  Decision-making frameworks  Disaster recovery  Extreme storm events  Flood resiliency  Fluid and solids  Fluid systems  Hydrodynamic modeling  Property  Resilience restorative curve  Floods",A Decision-Making Framework Integrating Fluid and Solid Systems to Assess Resilience of Coastal Communities Experiencing Extreme Storm Events,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2420191252076104,0.07885844486084476,0.006087550513288305,0.03704362018914192,Analytical
18015,"Fragility curves for non-ductile reinforced concrete frames that exhibit different component response mechanisms Around the world, a large percentage of buildings in regions of high seismicity are older, non-ductile reinforced concrete. To assess the risk posed by these buildings, fragility functions are required to define the likelihood that these buildings will sustain damage and collapse under earthquake loading. This paper presents the initial phase of a research effort to develop fragility functions for non-ductile concrete frames using numerical simulation; the research presented in this paper focuses on development of the numerical model and application of the model to develop fragility functions for a prototype non-ductile concrete frame. To enable numerical simulation of concrete frame buildings, response models for beam-column joints and columns are developed to provide (1) appropriate simulation of component response and, thereby, reliable assessment of risk and (2) computational efficiency and robustness. These new models are developed using existing experimental data, build on response models proposed by others, and employ component and material models available in the OpenSees analysis platform (http://opensees.berkeley.edu). A new beam-column joint model combines a new expression for joint strength and newly developed cyclic response parameters; a new column response model includes a new shear-strength model and newly developed cyclic response parameters. Numerical models of a prototype non-ductile concrete frame are developed that include simulation of one or more of the following characteristics: (1) rigid beam-column joint, (2) nonlinear joint shear response, (3) nonlinear joint shear and bond-slip response, and (4) column shear failure. Dynamic analyses are performed using these frame models and a suite of ground motions; analysis results are used to develop fragility curves. Fragility curves quantify the vulnerability of the frame and provide understanding of the impact of different component failure mechanisms on frame vulnerability. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

19661,"Preliminary prediction of damage to residential buildings following the 21st August 2017 Ischia earthquake On August 21st, 2017, an earthquake with duration magnitude Md = 4.0 and epicentre in Casamicciola Terme hit Ischia island, in the South of Italy. This event caused two fatalities and dozens of injured people. Moreover, despite the low magnitude, the earthquake produced significant damages to masonry and reinforced concrete (RC) buildings, with some partial or complete collapse of structures, in a very limited area close to the epicentre, while even at small distance from the most damaged zone the earthquake was just felt by local people and tourists. In the days after the event, discussions concerning the destructive effects of such an earthquake arose in the scientific community—as also reported by local and national media. In this paper, the seismic history of Ischia island is recalled to show and explain the peculiarity of the August 21st earthquake, which is also described in terms of ground motion and response spectra characteristics. The results of the first surveys carried out in Casamicciola Terme are reported, together with appropriate pictures, to introduce and explain the observed damage state of masonry and RC buildings in the epicentral zone. Then, data from the 15th general census of the population and dwellings (ISTAT) is used to define vulnerability classes according to the classification of the European Macrosismic Scale (EMS-98) (Grünthal, 1998). Seismic damage scenarios are then evaluated combining macro-seismic intensity values obtained using an interpolation method starting from QUEST macro-seismic survey data (Azzaro et al., 2017) and fragility curves for A-to-D vulnerability classes and for five damage states, from DS0 (no damage) to DS5 (collapse) trough a Monte Carlo simulation technique. The distributions of Usable, Temporarily or Partially Unusable, and Unusable buildings, which are obtained by using relationships between damage and usability judgments obtained through post-earthquake damage data collected after past seismic events, result in very good accordance with those published in September 1st, 2017 by the Department of Civil Protection, regarding a dataset of about 600 buildings. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature. 2017 Ischia earthquake  Census data  Damage  Macrosesmic  Usability Earthquake effects  Housing  Intelligent systems  Monte Carlo methods  Population statistics  Reinforced concrete  Seismic prospecting  Surveys  Census data  Damage  Interpolation method  Macrosesmic  Monte carlo simulation technique  Residential building  Scientific community  Usability  Structural analysis  architectural design  census  collapse structure  damage mechanics  earthquake damage  earthquake epicenter  earthquake event  earthquake magnitude  earthquake prediction  ground motion  masonry  Monte Carlo analysis  reinforced concrete  seismic survey  Italy",Preliminary prediction of damage to residential buildings following the 21st August 2017 Ischia earthquake,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1917368984674399,0.2466330240608094,0.028653925230870354,0.03842885244809641,Empirical
19839,"Propagating fragility curve for RC buildings via HAZUS methodology In this era where sustainability plays a key role, to design structures for resisting the earthquake in best probable manner is an inspiration for all designers. The recent trend for structural engineers is evolving in the direction of NSA (Nonlinear Static Analysis) in order to generate its ultimate building capacity. Frame structures are evaluated using NSA i.e. push-over analysis to interpret the phenomenon of plastic yielding being experienced within the structure. ATC-40 has well illustrated various performance levels of the buildings. When seismic loads are active due to shaking of ground, it is essential to assess the conditional probability of structural response. This can be done using conditional probability as a function and plotting fragility curves for structural response due to application of seismic activity or loading as a function. These fragility curves are useful not only for calamities before earthquake but also after earthquake to evaluate the seismic losses. The probability of whichever damage state being exceeded can be plotted using fragility curves which can be derived using empirical or analytical methods which rely on both the source of the data along with type of analysis. This paper addresses the analytical method using the guidelines given by the HAZUS MH technical manual. The work represented here is compiled by means of procedure for establishing the fragility curves for three typical Reinforced Concrete (RC) frame structures having variations resembling 3 storey intended for short-period structures, 6 storey used for medium-period structures and 12 storey representing long-period structures. For analyzing structures, FEM based software SAP2000 has been used as a tool. The present study contributes towards quantification of seismic fragility; henceforth fragility curves are co-related and plotted which provides a rational and consistent probabilistic treatment of damage or loss.

17111,"Earthquake loss estimation for Greater Cairo and the national economic implications The Egyptian economy and culture are centralized in the Greater Cairo region. Thus, it is essential that the built environment is able to withstand the possible earthquake events that may occur, and to continue to operate and function. Failure to do so would result in significant economic losses. This study presents the latter stages of a multi-tiered probabilistic earthquake loss estimation model for Greater Cairo and builds upon previous studies of the seismic hazard. In order to assess possible damage to the built environment, and the resulting economic losses, the vulnerability of the built environment is first evaluated. Through the use of satellite images, Egypts building census, previous studies and field surveys, a building-stock inventory is compiled. This building inventory is classified according to structural type and height, and is geocoded by district. Using existing fragility curves, the vulnerability of the building stock is assessed. In addition, the vulnerability of both the electricity and natural gas networks are assessed, through the use of fragility curves, cut sets and an evaluation of the supply networks. Based on the assessment of direct losses, the losses associated with building damage far exceed those associated with the considered network infrastructure. A macro-economic model is developed that takes into account damage to the built environment and provides estimates of indirect economic losses, as well as enabling the identification of the optimal recovery process. Using this model, it is shown that the indirect losses can exceed direct losses for extreme scenarios where the economy is brought to a near standstill. The framework developed and presented herein can be extended to include more networks, and is also applicable to other regions. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

20573,"Seismic fragility analysis of poorly built timber buildings in yangon slum areas In Yangon and the suburbs of Myanmar, timber-framed buildings are the popular choice of construction for residential purposes. Nearly 8% of the total population in Yangon live in the slums and slum-like areas where the dwellings are predominantly made of non-durable materials. Wood, jungle wood, and bamboo are used as the framework and corrugated gal-vanized iron sheets as walling and sheathing material. The seismic-resistance capacity of timber buildings in slum areas has never been approved based on experimental evidence. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a seismic fragility analysis for poorly built timber buildings by providing a suitable method through numerical and experimental approaches. Pull-over loading tests were conducted on selected buildings to assess their loading-displacement capacity. Further, numerical modeling was done using the Wallstat simulation tool, which is based on the discrete element method. The pushover curve was validated with the curve from the pull-over load test. Once the numerical model was confirmed, dynamic analysis was conducted for different peak ground acceleration (PGA) (g) values until the complete numerical collapse of the building. Three building configurations with three ranges of variable material properties were considered in this study.

17402,"Epistemic uncertainty assessment using Incremental Dynamic Analysis and Neural Networks Incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) is a powerful method for the seismic performance assessment of structures. IDA is also very efficient for handling uncertainty due to the mechanical properties of the structure. In the latter case, IDA should be performed within a Monte Carlo framework requiring the execution of a vast number of nonlinear response history analyses. The increased computing effort renders the calculation of performance statistics time-consuming and hence the method is not always practical. We propose a scheme based on artificial neural networks (NN) in order to reduce the computational effort. Within a Monte Carlo approach, trained NN can rapidly generate a large sample of IDA curves and therefore allow us to easily calculate useful response statistics and fragility curves. The implementation of the proposed approach is quick, straightforward and quite accurate.

19324,"Optimal earthquake intensity measures for probabilistic seismic demand models of ARP1400 reactor containment building This study identifies efficient earthquake intensity measures (IMs) for seismic performances and fragility evaluations of the reactor containment building (RCB) in the advanced power reactor 1400 (APR1400) nuclear power plant (NPP). The computational model of RCB is constructed using the beam-truss model (BTM) for nonlinear analyses. A total of 90 ground motion records and 20 different IMs are employed for numerical analyses. A series of nonlinear time-history analyses are performed to monitor maximum floor displacements and accelerations of RCB. Then, probabilistic seismic demand models of RCB are developed for each IM. Statistical parameters including coefficient of determination (R2), dispersion (i.e. standard deviation), practicality, and proficiency are calculated to recognize strongly correlated IMs with the seismic performance of the NPP structure. The numerical results show that the optimal IMs are spectral acceleration, spectral velocity, spectral displacement at the fundamental period, acceleration spectrum intensity, effective peak acceleration, peak ground acceleration, A95, and sustained maximum acceleration. Moreover, weakly related IMs to the seismic performance of RCB are peak ground displacement, root-mean-square of displacement, specific energy density, root-mean-square of velocity, peak ground velocity, Housner intensity, velocity spectrum intensity, and sustained maximum velocity. Finally, a set of fragility curves of RCB are developed for optimal IMs. © 2021 Korean Nuclear Society Earthquake intensity measure  Fragility curve  Nonlinear time-history analysis  Optimality  Probabilistic seismic demand model  Reactor containment building None",Optimal earthquake intensity measures for probabilistic seismic demand models of ARP1400 reactor containment building,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1365593702461472,0.03465783353757691,0.01668102397505786,0.08176152159059487,Analytical
16014,"Building damage from the 2011 Great East Japan tsunami: quantitative assessment of influential factors A new perspective on building damage analysis Based on the classification provided by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT), the damage level of buildings impacted by the 2011 Great East Japan tsunami can be separated into six levels (from minor damage to washed away). The objective of this paper is to identify the significant predictor variables and the direction of their potential relationship to the damage level in order to create a predicting formula for damage level. This study used the detailed data of damaged buildings in Ishinomaki city, Miyagi prefecture, Japan, collected by MLIT. The explanatory variables tested included the inundation depth, number of floors, structural material, and function of the building. Ordinal regression was applied to model the relationship between the ordinal outcome variable (damage level) and the predictors. The findings indicated that inundation depth, structural material, and function of building were significantly associated with the damage level. In addition to this new type of model, this research provides a valuable insight into the relative influence of different factors on building damage and suggestions that may help to revise the classification of current standards. This study can contribute to academic tsunami research by assessing the contribution of different variables to the observed damage using new approaches based on statistical analysis and regression. Moreover, practical applications of these results include understanding of the predominant factors driving tsunami damage to structures, implementation of the relevant variables into the proposed, or alternative model in order to improve current damage predictions by taking into account not only inundation depth, but also variables such as structural material and function of building. 2011 Great East Japan tsunami  Building damage level  Ordinal regression  Prediction FRAGILITY CURVES  VULNERABILITY  REGRESSION  MODEL",Building damage from the 2011 Great East Japan tsunami: quantitative assessment of influential factors A new perspective on building damage analysis,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08020827606223561,0.07154183412465161,0.01930599218310277,0.014877559281151632,Analytical

12554,"A study on fragility analyses of masonry buildings in Erzincan (Turkey) utilizing simulated and real ground motion records Ground motion records are generally required to develop fragility curves which are utilized in seismic loss estimation studies for earthquake prone zones. These records could be 'real', i.e. recorded acceleration time series or 'simulated' records consistent with the regional seismicity and produced using alternative simulation techniques. This study mainly concentrates on development of fragility curves for masonry buildings located in Erzincan (eastern Turkey) using 'simulated' ground motion records and evaluates the suitability of these fragilities by comparing with the curves developed utilizing 'real' records. To generate a set of scenario earthquakes by using regional seismicity parameters of Erzincan, stochastic finite-fault methodology has been employed as the simulation technique. The 'real' records, on the other hand, are selected from Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center's NGA-West2 ground motion database and chosen to be compatible with the seismological characteristics of the region of interest. The records are imposed on a set of masonry buildings (with 1-, 2-, 3-stories and 3 different quality classes) representing the building stock in Erzincan. To assess the dynamic responses of the structures, nonlinear time history analyses utilizing equivalent single-degree-of-freedom systems are performed on OpenSees platform. Afterwards, fragility curves for three limit states (Immediate Occupancy, Life Safety and Collapse Prevention) are generated. This study also investigates the sensitivity of these fragility curves to ground motion variability and two alternative fragility curve generation methods. © 2017 The Authors.

18054,"Fragility curves of restoration processes for resilience analysis In literature the fragility curves are usually adopted to evaluate the probability of exceedance of a given damage state. This chapter presents for the first time a procedure for developing fragility curves of restoration processes which can be adopted for resilience analysis. The restoration process describes the capacity to recover from a system failure and it is one of the most uncertain variables in the resilience analysis therefore, the problem should be treated in probabilistic terms. In the chapter, a method is proposed for evaluating the Restoration Fragility Functions (RFF) of a given system following an extreme event. The restoration curves have been built empirically using the data obtained by a discrete event simulation model of the system considered. Different restoration processes obtained through Monte Carlo simulations have been analyzed statistically to determine the probability of exceedance of a given restoration state. Then, Restoration Fragility Functions (RFF) are obtained using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) approach assuming a lognormal cumulative distribution function. The method has been applied to an Emergency Department of a hospital during a crisis, because these buildings are critical facilities which should withstand after an earthquake in order to assist injuries.

12925,"Expert-based versus data-driven flood damage models: A comparative evaluation for data-scarce regions The knowledge about potential flood damage is a key issue for disaster risk reduction. However, the scarcity of empirical data has limited flood damage modeling in several regions. As a result, studies in data-scarce regions have mostly been restricted to either building exposure assessment or identification of vulnerability indicators without a further linkage to probable damage. As expert-based approaches do not require empirical damage data, they have a high potential for flood damage modeling in data-scarce regions. In this study, we carried out a comparative assessment between an expert-based and a data-driven approach. The expert-based approach systematically combines the vulnerability indicator method and synthetic what-if analysis based on the knowledge of regional experts. The data-driven approach integrates empirical flood damage data in the analysis applying a multivariate random forest model. Flood damage data, collected through interviews after two flood events in 2017 and 2019 at separate locations in Nigeria, were used to evaluate the performance of both methods based on developed damage grades. Results from both methods showed i) a predictive accuracy of 30% and 38% for the expert-based and data-driven approaches respectively, ii) that distance to channel, wall material, building condition, and building quality are significant regional damage drivers, and iii) comparable model performance can be achieved even with a reduced number of variables. Furthermore, the study demonstrated how experts are likely to underestimate damage at low water depths and how a difference in conformity to building standards can add to challenges in flood damage prediction. © 2021 The Author(s) Damage grades  Damage prediction  Data-driven  Data-scarce  Expert-based  Flood None",Expert-based versus data-driven flood damage models: A comparative evaluation for data-scarce regions,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,Empirical
20667,"Seismic fragility curves for structures using non-parametric representations Fragility curves are commonly used in civil engineering to assess the vulnerability of structures to earthquakes. The probability of failure associated with a prescribed criterion (e.g., the maximal inter-storey drift of a building exceeding a certain threshold) is represented as a function of the intensity of the earthquake ground motion (e.g., peak ground acceleration or spectral acceleration). The classical approach relies on assuming a lognormal shape of the fragility curves; it is thus parametric. In this paper, we introduce two non-parametric approaches to establish the fragility curves without employing the above assumption, namely binned Monte Carlo simulation and kernel density estimation. As an illustration, we compute the fragility curves for a three-storey steel frame using a large number of synthetic ground motions. The curves obtained with the non-parametric approaches are compared with respective curves based on the lognormal assumption. A similar comparison is presented for a case when a limited number of recorded ground motions is available. It is found that the accuracy of the lognormal curves depends on the ground motion intensity measure, the failure criterion and most importantly, on the employed method for estimating the parameters of the lognormal shape. © 2017, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. earthquake engineering  epistemic uncertainty  fragility curves  kernel density estimation  lognormal assumption  non-parametric approach Codes (symbols)  Earthquake engineering  Earthquakes  Geophysics  Intelligent systems  Monte Carlo methods  Statistics  Uncertainty analysis  Epistemic uncertainties  Fragility curves  Kernel Density Estimation  Log-normal  Nonparametric approaches  Parameter estimation",Seismic fragility curves for structures using non-parametric representations,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19907925930277273,0.08828414648188657,0.012359012124041082,0.07724686676157073,Analytical
15190,"A methodology for rapid earthquake damage assessment of existing buildings In an effort to contribute to the reduction of the potential seismic risk in Canada, the Geological Survey of Canada has recently undertaken a comprehensive quantitative risk assessment study. The proposed framework for risk assessment considers region-specific inventory of the building stock, definition of the seismic hazard and evaluation of respective vulnerabilities. Structural vulnerability represents the key component within the framework and is derived from the fragility functions combining the intensity of the seismic motion to the expected damage for a given building type. This paper focuses on the development of a rapid procedure for the development of analytical seismic fragility functions based on the structural characteristics of the existing buildings in Old Quebec City with emphasis to historic stone masonry buildings. The applied procedure incorporates: (1) capacity curves to characterize the nonlinear behaviour of the existing buildings; (2) displacement fragility curves to represent the probability of exceedance of specified damage state under various levels of structural response; and (3) response spectra to estimate the structural demand for a series of earthquake magnitude-distance combinations. A modified capacity spectrum method is proposed for rapid evaluation of expected damage as opposed to the usual iterative procedure for the displacement response, e.g., the one implemented in the Hazus software. The developed methodology revealed to be a powerful tool for rapid assessment of regional seismic risk as it significantly reduces the computation time. It was validated for damage assessment of 1220 buildings in the Old Quebec City for a scenario event of M6.2 and distance 15km. The results show that some 30% of the buildings would suffer a certain degree of damage with most of the damage attributable to the poor performance of masonry buildings. The damage results are almost identical with those obtained by applying the Hazus software for the same input parameters.

16768,"Derivation of fragility curves for URM school buildings in Nepal In recent years there has been an increasing interest from governmental authorities and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in the seismic safety enhancement of school buildings in developing countries. Schools represent a reference point for local communities and can be used as primary facilities for emergency and recovery activities after an earthquake. Focusing on the Nepal case, the last 2015 seismic events have shown that Nepalese school buildings are characterized by a high level of vulnerability. According to post-disaster surveys, more than the 20 percent of the country's classrooms experienced damage or collapse during the earthquake. Nepal's building stock is mainly constituted by non-engineered constructions realized without seismic detailing and material quality controls. Particularly, unreinforced masonry (URM) structures, representing the majority of the total building inventory, are characterized by numerous construction deficiencies such as inadequate wall-to-wall or wall-to-floor connections which have led to frequent out-of-plane collapses. Herein, a spectral-based methodology to derive fragility curves for Nepalese unreinforced masonry school buildings subjected to out-of-plane damage is discussed. The technique is applied to the case of typical mud-mortar URM Nepalese structures, by taking into account regional variations in construction practice, material properties and recurrent failure modes detected after the 2015 seismic events. © 13th International Conference on Applications of Statistics and Probability in Civil Engineering, ICASP 2019.

21242,"Seismic vulnerability of masonry infilled reinforced concrete frame structures Despite intense worldwide research in the area of masonry infilled frame structures during the past half a century, displacement-based non-linear analyses of masonry infilled frames with explicit consideration of infill panels as structural elements is far from common practice in earthquake resistant design of such structures. The displacements are of particular interest from the viewpoint of performance-based design (PBD), the emerging paradigm for the next generation of standard codes of practice for earthquake resistant design. The present paper is based on an analytical study of the seismic performance and vulnerability of typical planar masonry infilled reinforced concrete (R/C) frames considering the effect of distribution of masonry infill panels over the elevation of the R/C frame using rational displacement based analysis methods such as non-linear dynamic time-history analysis based on realistic and efficient hysteretic models of the structural elements. The results of the displacementbased analyses are used to develop seismic vulnerability curves in probabilistic terms for the populations of typical medium-rise masonry infilled reinforced concrete (R/C) framed buildings.

22037,"Typological seismic fragility assessment of old railway stations by nonlinear time history analysis The homogeneity of standard Italian railway stations in terms of period of construction (second half of the 19th century), architectural and structural features, typical dimensions and morphology (mostly depending on expected number of passengers) allows the identification of building typologies, with an expected similar behaviour under seismic actions. Four typologies of standard railway stations were identified and, for each of them, variability in building geometry and material parameters was accounted for. Fragility curves were then derived by means of multi-stripe nonlinear dynamic analyses on equivalent-frame 3D macroelement models of the structures, for appropriately selected limit states. The results obtained can be very useful for assessing the seismic vulnerability of this kind of structures, whose seismic behaviour is of strategic importance, both for the potentially high number of victims and for the need of keeping railway lines operational in the aftermath of a seismic event. Also, the results presented in this study could be useful to set prioritization schemes of retrofitting interventions, starting from the identification of the stations most at risk, by combining fragility curves and seismic hazard information. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

19968,"Real-Time City-Scale Time-History Analysis and Its Application in Resilience-Oriented Earthquake Emergency Responses The resilience of cities has received worldwide attention. An accurate and rapid assessment of seismic damage, economic loss, and post-event repair time can provide an important reference for emergency rescue and post-earthquake recovery. Based on city-scale nonlinear time-history analysis (THA) and regional seismic loss prediction, a real-time city-scale time-history analysis method is proposed in this work. In this method, the actual ground motion records obtained from seismic stations are input into the building models of the earthquake-stricken area, and the nonlinear time-history analysis of these models is subsequently performed using a high-performance computing platform. The seismic damage to the buildings in the target region subjected to this earthquake is evaluated according to the analysis results. The economic loss and repair time of the earthquake-stricken areas are calculated using the engineering demand parameters obtained from the time-history analysis. A program named, Real-time Earthquake Damage Assessment using City-scale Time-history analysis (RED-ACT for short) was developed to automatically implement the above workflow.

15481,"An analytical framework for seismic fragility analysis of RC high-rise buildings An analytical framework and sample application are presented for the seismic fragility assessment of reinforced-concrete high-rise buildings. Since no probabilistic fragility relationships exist for this class of structure, the work fills an important void in regional earthquake impact assessment. The key element of the presented framework is the methodology for the development of a simple lumped-parameter model representative of the complex high-rise building system. This model was created in the ZEUS-NL environment to enable computationally efficient dynamic response history analyses of high-rise structures that were previously not possible and that can accurately account for the complex behaviour and interactions predicted by more detailed analytical models. The parameters for this model were selected using genetic algorithms. The development of a simple lumped-parameter model is presented for an existing high-rise structure with dual core walls and a reinforced concrete frame. The accuracy of the individual components of this model is compared with the predictions of more detailed analytical models and sample fragility curves are presented.

13122,"Modelling correlated damages of residential building portfolios under tropical cyclone wind loads Performing probabilistic damage assessment for a community under a tropical cyclone event needs to consider the collective damage of individual structures within the community, which involves modeling the spatial correlations of hazard demands and structural capacities between individual structures. However, how to model these two kinds of spatial correlations and how they influence the damage assessment remain unclear. In this paper, focus is given to the roof sheathing damage of a residential building portfolio consisting of multiple wooden residential buildings under the wind loads of a tropical cyclone event. Two methods are used to predict the damage of individual buildings based on their hazard demands: one is using a direct Monte Carlo Simulation in which structural (capacity) parameters of different buildings are treated as correlated. This method provides accurate results but needs a lot of information. Another approach is to probabilistically predict the damage state of each building based on its hazard demand using its fragility functions. The relative importance of the correlations of hazard demands and structural capacities is investigated. It is demonstrated that the correlations of damage states are strongly dependent on hazard demands. Finally, a method is developed to simulate correlated damage states of a building portfolio given hazard demands, through incorporating the hazard-dependent correlations with fragility functions using Gaussian Copula. © 13th International Conference on Applications of Statistics and Probability in Civil Engineering, ICASP 2019.

13482,"Site specific record selection and seismic fragility analysis Seismic fragility of a 5-storey regular shear wall building was derived through nonlinear dynamic analysis and the effect of site specific record selection and direction of applied load were investigated. Two sets of twenty synthetic earthquake records compatible with western and eastern Canadian seismicity are applied to the structural model. Fragility curves of the building were developed having spectral acceleration at the fundamental period of the structure and peak ground acceleration as seismic intensity measures. The results indicated that fragility curves are less sensitive to record selection when spectral acceleration is chosen as the seismic intensity measure, as this parameter provides a normalized format of hazard intensity. On the other hand, when peak ground acceleration is chosen as seismic intensity indicator, significant change is observed in fragility curves derived for sites with different seismicity characteristics. Numerical simulation of the building was further analyzed under western seismic records applied at an angle of 45 degree and the results of dynamic analysis and fragility curves are compared to the case that records are applied parallel to one of the principle directions. Based on the result, applying bidirectional load would cause a delay in entering nonlinear range of behaviour for the structure and therefore is not a conservative approach at lower levels of seismic intensity. © 6th International Conference on Engineering Mechanics and Materials 2017.

20624,"Seismic Fragility Assessment of Existing 9 Storey Reinforced Concrete (RC) Buildings in Patna, India Precise and accurate estimation of building’s response is the demand of the time. Since the response of any building is always associated with inherent uncertainty, its consideration is utmost for the preciseness of their vulnerability. The uncertainties can be due to two reasons, (1) randomness in ground motion, also termed as aleatoric uncertainty, and (2) variability in structural modelling (epistemic uncertainty). The present work focuses on obtaining the variability functions and fragility curves by considering those uncertainties for 9 storey RC buildings in Patna, India, which is a region of high seismicity. Variability due to randomness in ground motion was determined by generating several artificial ground motions (comprising both near as well as far-field). Therefore, extensive study of the seismotectonic map of the region was required to determine the nearby faults, past earthquakes and other random parameters contributing variability. Structural variability, on the other hand, is generally attributed to the uncertainty in the estimation of material, geometrical properties, of which the building is made and at the same time due to the uncertainty in design details. Therefore, their consideration is vital in fragility analysis. Material strength, storey height, plan typology and design methodologies were considered as the random parameters in this study. The selection of these parameters was purely based on the extensive survey of buildings in the region. Considering the several combinations of random parameters, the buildings were analysed using non-linear static (NLS) pushover analysis to obtain pushover curves. These pushover curves were converted to capacity curves considering the dynamic characteristic of the first mode of vibration. The obtained capacity curves were then utilised to derive the variability in the capacity spectrum corresponding to particular damage states. Eventually, lognormal variability function and fragility curves for 9 storey representative buildings were obtained considering both the uncertainties. The obtained fragility curves corresponding to particular damage states give a measure for the vulnerability of buildings in that region. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

19682,"Probabilistic assessment of structural damage due to earthquakes for buildings in mid-America This paper provides an approach to conduct a probabilistic assessment of structural damage due to seismic events with an application to typical building structures in mid-America. The developed methodology includes modified damage state classifications based on the Applied Technology Council (ATC)-13 and ATC-38 damage states and the ATC-38 database of building damage. Damage factors are assigned to each damage state to quantify structural damage as a percentage of structural replacement cost. To account for the inherent uncertainties, these factors are expressed as random variables with a Beta distribution. A set of fragility curves, quantifying the structural vulnerability of a building, is mapped onto the developed methodology to determine the expected structural damage. The total structural damage factor for a given seismic intensity is then calculated using a probabilistic approach. Prediction and confidence bands are also constructed to account for the prevailing uncertainties. The expected seismic structural damage is assessed for three types of building structures in the mid-American region using the developed methodology. In addition, a sensitivity analysis for the probabilistic parameters is conducted. The developed methodology provides a transparent procedure where the structural damage factors can be updated as additional seismic damage data becomes available. © 2009 ASCE.

17471,"Evaluating targeted heuristics for vulnerability assessment in flood impact model chains In flood risk management, the choice of vulnerability functions has a remarkable impact on the overall uncertainty of modelling flood damage. The spatial transferability of empirical vulnerability functions is limited, leading to the need for computation and validation of region-specific vulnerability functions. In data-scarce regions however, this option is not feasible. In contrast, the physical processes of flood impact model chains can be developed in these regions because of the availability of global datasets. Here we evaluated the implementation of a synthetic vulnerability function into a flood impact model. The function bases on expert heuristics on a targeted sample of representative buildings (targeted heuristics). We applied the vulnerability function in a meso-scale river basin and evaluated the new function by comparing the resulting flood damage with the damage computed by other approaches, (1) an ensemble of vulnerability functions available from the literature, (2) an individual vulnerability function calibrated with region-specific data, and (3) the vulnerability function used in flood risk management by the Swiss government. The results show that targeted heuristics can be a valuable alternative for developing flood impact models in regions without any data or only few data on flood damage. extreme events  flood damages  floodplain  vulnerability RISK-ASSESSMENT  PHYSICAL VULNERABILITY  DAMAGE MODELS  EXPOSURE  CURVES  URBAN  WIDTH",Evaluating targeted heuristics for vulnerability assessment in flood impact model chains,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09876651479590443,0.284536954464424,0.061647064031416864,0.014451570773401777,Empirical
17276,"Effects of ground-motion sequences on fragility and vulnerability of case-study reinforced concrete frames This study investigates the effects of ground-motion sequences on fragility and vulnerability of reinforced concrete (RC) moment-resisting frames (MRFs). Two four-storey, four-bay RC MRFs are selected as case studies. These structures, which share the same geometry, are representative of distinct vulnerability classes in the Mediterranean region and are characterized by different material properties, cross-section dimensions, and detailing. The first case study is a ductile MRF designed according to Eurocode 8 (i.e., a special-code frame), while the second is a non-ductile MRF designed to sustain only gravity loads (i.e., a pre-code frame). The influence of masonry infills on their seismic performance is also investigated. Advanced numerical models are developed to perform cloud-based sequential nonlinear time history analyses using ground-motion sequences assembled by randomly pairing two real records via Latin hypercube sampling. Different structure-specific damage states are considered to derive fragility curves for the undamaged structures, when subjected to a single ground-motion record, and state-dependent fragility curves by considering the additional damage induced by a second ground-motion record within the sequence. Damage-to-loss models are then used to derive mean vulnerability relationships. Results of the analysis show the importance of considering the effect of damage accumulation in the pre-code frames. Moreover, the presence of infills shows an overall positive contribution to the seismic performance of both frame types. Vector-valued vulnerability relationships accounting for the damaging effect of two ground-motion records are finally presented in the form of mean vulnerability surfaces.

21163,"Seismic vulnerability assessment of low to mid-rise RC buildings addressing prevailing design and construction practices in the Northeastern region of the Indian subcontinent: A case study based approach RC buildings with infilled masonry are very common in Northeast India and neighbouring countries like Nepal, along with open ground storey (OGS) buildings and bare framed buildings. In this region, due to the low financial capacity of the owners, most of the private buildings are constructed either with a consultation to local masons without any engineering input or by the engineers, mainly based on the thumb-rules. In such cases, design and construction quality (DCQ) and non-uniform distribution of the infill wall increase the damage level. Herein, an effort has been made to quantify the influence of DCQ, infill wall distribution, and their combined effect on seismic response. The vulnerability of low to mid-rise RC buildings is studied through fragility analysis using a simplistic nonlinear static analysis based method. The fragility curves show that inferior design and construction quality and the absence of masonry infill on the ground floor increases susceptibility to the manifold. However, the vulnerability of these RC buildings, including the ones with an open ground storey, can be decreased through well design and construction practices under controlled supervision. Thus, it may avoid collapse mainly for low seismic hazards that are often striking the Northeastern region of the Indian subcontinent and many other countries relatively more frequently than the very severe event. The overall observations that came out from the study may prove beneficial for selecting the suitable building configuration by design engineers, keeping a balance between safety and economy. The results obtained in the form of various curves and tables may be used for the preliminary design of new buildings and seismic risk assessment of existing buildings of such regions as well as of other areas with similar building typologies. Hence, the study may prove useful not only in the design offices, but the approach outlined in the study may be applied to various regions for vulnerability assessment, using the methodology having a fair compromise between rigour and accuracy.

21890,"The World Housing Encyclopedia: A means to stimulate seismic risk reduction efforts in developing countries The World Housing Encyclopedia (WHE) is an internet-based tool that is being used to help build capacity in developing countries by sharing knowledge and experiences and engaging professionals in various countries in the development of tutorials and participation in specific projects. The author is an Associate Editor of this project and has been involved in various WHE-related activities, ranging from working with colleagues in developing countries to prepare reports on their construction types to participating in the WHE-PAGER project by collecting and providing fragility curves for several non-US construction types. The structure of the WHE project is only possible because of the widespread use of the internet, and in fact relies on email and the website itself as a way to share information and discuss ideas with participants who are in 50+ countries. Often, the preparation of a housing report for the WHE represents a first step for young engineers in developing countries to collaborate with international colleagues and to work on a research-oriented report. The path, however, from taking the initiative to finalizing a report can be a bumpy road which is hampered by lack of communication as a result of language difficulties and misunderstandings, and unreliable internet connections. Sharing information by e-mail and the internet is of course only a first step in making real and lasting change and improvement in construction practices. It has been proven that the WHE database contains much information necessary to understand the building characteristics and structural vulnerability of various engineered and non-engineered building typologies and thus may serve as an input source for seismic risk and loss assessment studies. The WHE thereby contributes to the direct and indirect building of capacities in these countries. This presentation will also discuss ideas for affecting change ""on the ground"" that could use the WHE network, including regional and local trainings based on WHE tutorials and the sharing of capacity and fragility curves for a wide range of construction types found in developing countries.

17879,"Force and displacement based vulnerability assessment for traditional buildings Vulnerability assessment for historic buildings is usually carried out using capacity based approaches and prediction of losses is obtained by using normal or lognormal distributions for expected levels of macro seismic intensity or peak ground accelerations. Several authors have outlined the limitations of such approach. The paper presents a method to correlate analysis of seismic vulnerability using a failure mechanisms approach to observed in situ damage. The various aspects of the procedure are highlighted with application to a real case. It is shown how once the typologies within a sample have been identified, fragility curves for each of them can be derived and predictive cumulative damage curve obtained for samples for which direct survey of damage data is lacking.

18874,"Micro-scale flood damage and risk assessments: A case study in Kelantan, Malaysia In effort to understand and reduce flood consequences more effectively and strategically, flood risk assessment has been a cornerstone of a long-term flood management. One component of flood risk assessment is the estimation of a range of possible damage to an area exposed to flooding, that is, the vulnerability curve. The vulnerability curve can be depicted by a stage-damage relationship. This study attempts to investigate how vulnerability to flooding can be quantitatively assessed using a micro-scale approach in Malaysia’s vulnerable areas. A residential area in Kota Bharu was chosen as the case study area. Depth-damage relationships from a multiple regression function of Department of Irrigation and Drainage Malaysia and spatial variability of residential buildings were used for the micro-scale assessment. Final estimates of expected annual damage were then calculated for each building type at 1-, 3- and 5-day flood durations. Results show that the methodology adopted is feasible to be applied for local-scale assessment flood risk assessment in Malaysia. The results also suggest that applying the methodology is possible when given wider availability of resources and information.

19636,"Prediction of potential damage due to severe earthquakes A statistical model is developed to estimate the seismic vulnerability of low- to mid-rise reinforced concrete buildings. The model is based on a novel utilization of the discriminant analysis technique of multivariate statistics. Number of stories above the ground level (N), soft story index (SSI), overhang ratio (OHR), minimum normalized lateral stiffness index (MNLSTFI), minimum normalized lateral strength index (MNLSI) and normalized redundancy score (NRS) are selected as the basic estimation variables. The earthquake damage data compiled for the 12 November 1999 Duzce earthquake are used to develop a discriminant function in terms of these estimation variables. The discriminant score obtained from the resulting discriminant function is then used to estimate the damage state of buildings ranging from no damage to collapse, with intermediate damage states of light, moderate and severe.

12775,"Developing seismic vulnerability curves for typical Iranian buildings Iran is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. In recent earthquakes, the low quality of constructions has caused huge losses, both in human and economic terms. The high level of seismic hazard in combination with a high physical vulnerability of structures leads to a high earthquake risk of Iran, which has to be managed in some ways. Earthquake happening in populated areas causing economic and human losses has shown the vital role of assessing buildings' vulnerabilities as well as loss estimations. Vulnerability curve is one of the essential instruments to evaluate structural losses before the events. Regarding the lack of categorized vulnerability curves for Iranian buildings, this study focuses on filling this critical gap. For this reason, empirical approach involving statistical processing on existing data from the previous studies is used to develop vulnerability curves for Iranian buildings by critiquing the existing fragility/vulnerability curves in Iran and other countries. The logic-tree method is used to combine these curves by weighting in accordance with the condition of construction provisions, seismic code and engineering judgment. Finally, vulnerability curves are developed for the 42 Iranian building types.

Reinforced concrete moment resisting frames constitute the majority of the buildings in Patna and the ratio of low-, mid- and high-rise buildings are in the ratio 2:2:1. The percentage of soft storey buildings in Patna is 23.37%. The finite element model of a representative 15-storey special moment resisting frame building is modelled utilizing the survey data. It is modelled with and without soil–structure interaction (SSI) effects to access the variation in the structural responses with and without SSI effects. The fundamental time period is underestimated in the fixed base model by 1.38 times when compared to the model with SSI effects. A set of raw acceleration time histories is obtained from PEER NGA WEST2 database and scaled to bedrock site-specific design spectra for Patna. The time histories are further checked for soil amplification and the ground motions representative of surface motions in Patna are generated. The seismic vulnerability of the representative building is assessed by Incremental dynamic analysis. Floor displacement and inter-storey drift are significantly underestimated in the fixed base model when compared to the SSI model. A realistic building located in the study region is also studied with and without soft-storey effects.

20625,"Seismic fragility assessment of existing reinforced concrete buildings in Patna, India Assessment of seismic fragility of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings requires appropriate consideration of uncertainty in aleatory and epistemic sources. Aleatory uncertainty is typically attributed to randomness in ground motion records, while epistemic is due to the uncertainties in structural modelling. The present work focuses on obtaining the variability functions and fragility curves by considering those uncertainties for low, mid and high rise RC buildings in Patna, India, which is a region of high seismicity. Modelling uncertainties requires consideration of material, geometrical, and design as random parameters. These parameters mainly comprise material strength, storey height, plan, typology, design provisions, and various irregularities. In this study, the selection of the random parameters is purely based on the investigation of buildings in the Patna region. Considering the multiple combinations of random parameters, the buildings are modelled and analysed using nonlinear static (NLS) pushover analysis. The monotonic load in a triangular pattern is applied for NLS analysis to get pushover curves. The pushover curves are subsequently converted into capacity curves considering the dynamic characteristic of the first mode of vibration. The obtained capacity curves are utilised to derive the variability in the capacity spectrum for different categories of RC buildings. Subsequently, variability due to randomness in ground motion records is determined by generating several artificial (comprising near field and far field) ground motions considering the seismotectonic map of the region. Thence, by accounting for both the uncertainties, lognormal variability functions are determined, and seismic fragility assessment is performed for different building categories in Patna, India. Furthermore, the seismic vulnerability of existing buildings can be determined based on the obtained fragility curve. © 2020 Institution of Structural Engineers Aleatory and epistemic uncertainty  Capacity spectrum  Fragility curve  Ground motion  Pushover analysis  Variability function  Vulnerability assessment None","Seismic fragility assessment of existing reinforced concrete buildings in Patna, India",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7328266612717249,0.05720957290599414,0.008451199249184247,0.02202958636311579,Analytical
18596,"Interpreting the socio-technical interactions within a wind damage-artificial neural network model for community resilience The use of machine learning has grown in popularity in various disciplines. Despite the popularity, the apparent 'black box' nature of such tools continues to be an area of concern. In this article, we attempt to unravel the complexity of this black box by exploring the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs), coupled with graph theory, to model and interpret the spatial distribution of building damage from extreme wind events at a community level. Structural wind damage is a topic that is mostly well understood for how wind pressure translates to extreme loading on a structure, how debris can affect that loading and how specific social characteristics contribute to the overall population vulnerability. While these themes are widely accepted, they have proven difficult to model in a cohesive manner, which has led primarily to physical damage models considering wind loading only as it relates to structural capacity. We take advantage of this modelling difficulty to reflect on two different ANN models for predicting the spatial distribution of structural damage due to wind loading. Through graph theory analysis, we study the internal patterns of the apparent black box of artificial intelligence of the models and show that social parameters are key to predict structural damage. tornado  debris  structural damage  machine learning SOCIAL VULNERABILITY  CORTICAL NETWORKS  ALGORITHM  PREDICTION  IMPACT",Interpreting the socio-technical interactions within a wind damage-artificial neural network model for community resilience,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,,,,ML
15618,"Analysis of uncertainties in seismic vulnerability modeling of stone masonry buildings Seismic vulnerability is defined as the amount of damage and loss incurred by a class of buildings with respect to the intensity of the ground shaking. It is represented by vulnerability functions of the mean damage factor defined as the ratio of the repair cost to the total replacement value. A simplified method is presented for development of vulnerability functions allowing for systematic quantification of uncertainties. The developed method was applied to stone masonry buildings in Old Quebec City, Canada. Vulnerability functions were developed using capacity curves describe the nonlinear lateral behavior of the building, and displacement fragility curves representing the probability of exceedance of a specified damage state under various levels of structural response. Parameters considered in the analyses are: displacement response, elastic damping, structural degradation factor, and the damage factors assigned to different damage states.The conducted sensitivity analysis showed that the mean damage factor is most sensitive to uncertainties in the capacity and displacement fragility curves. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

20611,"Seismic fragility assessment based on Bayesian updating This paper deals with development of seismic fragility curves of buildings associated with seismic performance index (Is) based on Bayesian updating theory. Several buildings' empirical fragility curves based on damage data in the Hyogo-ken Nambu earthquake in 1995 have been established. But estimated fragility curves are too approximate to apply to a particular building, because they have been constructed from various types of building data, from simulated spatial distribution of ground motion intensity. For more accurate estimation of a building, more detailed information of building such as the result of seismic diagnosis has to be reflected to the fragility estimation. These precise information will be fully utilized in the fragility estimation, based on Bayesian updating theory. seismic fragility  Bayesian updating  Is index None",Seismic fragility assessment based on Bayesian updating,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07457298587451952,0.4504808295224046,0.031181865915824596,0.05964653197010886,Empirical
20214,"Safety Levels of RC Frame Building in Wenchuan County Town A local and formal RC frame building in Wenchuan dicstrict, named Shuang-he market building which is damaged in 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, is studied by nonlinear finite element method. By using probabilistic seismic demand model (PSDM), the seismic fragility assessment of the RC frame is demonstrated on RC frames. Probabilistic seismic demand model (PSDM) for RC frame structures was built to assess the safety levels of the actual RC frames representative of design and construction practices in the Wenchuan county town. The fragility curves for immediate occupancy, significant damage, and collapse prevention damage levels of the RC frame building are analyzed.

22186,"Variable-resolution building exposure modelling for earthquake and tsunami scenario-based risk assessment: an application case in Lima, Peru We propose the use of variable resolution boundaries based on central Voronoi tessellations (CVTs) to spatially aggregate building exposure models for risk assessment to various natural hazards. Such a framework is especially beneficial when the spatial distribution of the considered hazards presents intensity measures with contrasting footprints and spatial correlations, such as in coastal environments. This work avoids the incorrect assumption that a single intensity value from hazards with low spatial correlation (e.g. tsunami) can be considered to be representative within large-sized geo-cells for physical vulnerability assessment, without, at the same time, increasing the complexity of the overall model. We present decoupled earthquake and tsunami scenario-based risk estimates for the residential building stock of Lima (Peru). We observe that earthquake loss models for far-field subduction sources are practically insensitive to the exposure resolution. Conversely, tsunami loss models and associated uncertainties depend on the spatial correlations of the hazard intensities as well as on the resolution of the exposure models. We note that for the portfolio located in the coastal area exposed to both perils in Lima, the ground shaking dominates the losses for lower-magnitude earthquakes, whilst tsunamis cause the most damage for larger-magnitude events. For the latter, two sets of existing empirical flow depth fragility models are used, resulting in large differences in the calculated losses. This study, therefore, raises awareness about the uncertainties associated with the selection of fragility models and spatial aggregation entities for exposure modelling and loss mapping.

Three models of buildings representatives of the Eixample district of Barcelona have been chosen. The seismic vulnerability is evaluated by means of the Risk-UE methodology. The seismic demand is described by elastic project spectrum, in this case, defined by the Eurocode 8. Fragility curves are obtained from a nonlinear analysis, considering the capacity spectra. Expected seismic damage is gotten with the damage probability matrices, which indicate the occurrence probability of a damage state for a seismic demand given. The analysis of the buildings has been performed by TreMuri program by means of a macroelements model, which represents of a whole masonry panel. The buildings, here, analyzed are real and detailed structural drawings and reports have been used to model them.

19434,"Performance evaluation using fragility analysis of rc frame-wall structures A frame-wall structure provides resistance to lateral loading by a combination of shear walls and rigid frames. Due to the difficulties in predicting earthquakes and its random nature, probabilistic analysis is proposed in analyzing structural seismic responses. Fragility curve represents a continuous relationship between a seismic intensity measure and the probability that the structure will reach or exceed a predefined damage state. The fragility analysis is carried out using lognormal distribution of clouds of responses obtained using Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA). In the present paper, 15, 18, 22 and 26 storeys RC moment resisting frame-wall structure are analysed for seismic zone IV. The structures are assumed to be resting on hard soil and are analysed using ETABS-2016 and designed as per IS code provisions. Geometrical configuration of the structure is considered as per IS 16700:2017. The performance evaluation of above frames is done using SeismoStruct software for set of 11 recorded ground motions of past Indian earthquake varying in range of magnitude from 5.6 to 7.8. For this study, limit states Immediate Occupancy (IO), Life Safety (LS) and Collapse Prevention (CP) are considered as the performance criteria referred from FEMA 356. From the fragility curves, it is observed that there is negligible probability of collapse for spectral acceleration corresponding to Design Basis Earthquake. Also, probability of exceedance increases as the number of storey increases at given level of spectral acceleration. This is due to reduction in median collapse capacity of building. © 2021 Gnedenko Forum. All rights reserved.

In the paper, fragility curves for typical older residential RC buildings, realized in Italy and other southern Europe countries from the 50s to the early 70s, are derived following a hybrid approach. Fragility curves are expressed in terms of spectral acceleration. Median values for each damage state (or performance limit state) are estimated based on the results of comprehensive loss assessment analysis and the definition of a suitable loss index. Dispersions are evaluated based on the results of accurate inelastic dynamic analyses carried out for a number of archetype buildings at increasing levels of seismic intensity.

20152,"Revision and improvement of the PTVA-3 model for assessing tsunami building vulnerability using “international expert judgment”: introducing the PTVA-4 model This work reviewed, assessed, enhanced and field-tested one of the most widely used index-based methods for assessing the vulnerability of buildings to tsunamis: the Papathoma Tsunami Vulnerability Assessment (PTVA) model. The review and assessment were undertaken through a participatory survey process engaging authors of scientific literature during 2005–2015 in the field of building vulnerability to tsunamis. Expert respondents updated the weights of the PTVA building vulnerability attributes based on their expertise and insights from the 2011 Tohoku Tsunami. The respondents were also free to suggest additional PTVA building attributes and to provide open comments on the model. We then analysed the outcomes of the questionnaire and we used them to generate a new improved version of the model, the PTVA-4, which we field-tested in the area of Botany Bay (Sydney), New South Wales. Using a cohort of over 2000 buildings and a tsunami scenario numerically simulated using state-of-the-art hydrodynamic modelling techniques, we applied the PTVA-4 model and compared the outcomes against its predecessor (i.e. the PTVA-3). Results showed the PTVA-4 model is significantly more accurate and more sensitive to variations in the tsunami demand parameter, the attributes of the exposed buildings and their surroundings. The PTVA-4 model is the first tool of its kind to integrate the judgment of specialised scientists worldwide. It constitutes a viable option to assess the vulnerability of buildings in areas where no tsunami vulnerability curves have been developed yet, or to consider the contribution to vulnerability given by a significantly wider range of building engineering and physical attributes.

18013,"Fragility curves for material characteristics and damage index for brick masonry exposed to freeze–thaw action In regions exposed to floods followed by cold weather, brick masonry as a structural basis of the building envelope can be damaged due to the accompanying phenomenon of freezing and thawing. The main purpose of the article is the development of a mathematical model able to predict the chosen mechanical parameters and damage index of brick wallets for a given number of freeze-thaw cycles. For this, a statistical model derived from experimental data is used. As a result, regression curves for Young’s modulus and ductility for two types of mortar are obtained. Furthermore, fragility curves for ductility and also the damage index, which is based on displacement ductility, are presented. The obtained results enable probabilistic risk assessments in the case of deteriorated ductility and increased damage on brick masonry due to freeze–thaw cycles. © 2021 by the authors.

12753,"Damage study and seismic vulnerability assessment of existing masonry buildings in Northeast India The Northeast region of India is considered to be the most seismically active zone in India, having witnessed two major earthquakes (Mw &gt; 8) in the past. Recently, the 2017 Ambasa earthquake (with Mw of 5.7) caused significant damage to unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings in Tripura, a Northeast state of India. The typical nature of damage observed in URM buildings during the post-earthquake damage survey highlights poor construction practices that have been used in this region even though the seismic hazard of the Northeast region of India is well established. In this context, the present study is an effort to evaluate through fragility analysis the vulnerability of existing low-rise URM buildings in Agartala, the capital city of Tripura, which in a broader sense represents the buildings of the entire Northeast region of India, through fragility analysis. In this regard, an assessment method based on a nonlinear static approach is used to develop bilinear capacity curve parameters. The capacity curve parameters are then used to estimate fragility functions. Fragility analysis shows that URM buildings would suffer heavy damage even for an earthquake having Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) of 0.18 g, which is used to design buildings in the Northeast region of India according to the Indian seismic code. Fragility curves developed in this study may prove useful for assessing the seismic risk of the same building typology in other urban areas of Northeast India.

15216,"A neural network-based multivariate seismic classifier for simultaneous post-earthquake fragility estimation and damage classification A scalar intensity measure (IM) could be insufficient to represent the earthquake intensity and variety in fragility estimation. Introducing multiple IMs to conventional regression of fragility functions can be computationally demanding and require priori assumptions of functional forms. In this study, multivariate seismic classifiers with multiple IMs as inputs are developed based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) to address the above disadvantages of traditional regression approaches. Case studies of a four-story code-conforming benchmark building indicate that fragility estimates from multi-IM ANN classifiers lead to higher accuracy (5.0% to 7.7%) in system-level and element-level damage classification than the single-IM traditional fragility curves. Further studies of IM combinations show that the ANN performance can be improved by more IMs correlated with structural responses while compromised by redundant irrelevant IMs. The optimal IM set should be determined by correlation ranking and ANN predictive performance together. Moreover, the ANN configuration of the case-study building is optimized with five readily available IMs as inputs, which enable a near real-time (within 0.3 ms) prediction of future earthquake damage while maintain high predictive performance. Overall, the multivariate ANN seismic classifier can be a promising tool for simultaneous seismic fragility estimation and damage assessment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd Artificial neural networks  Fragility estimation  Intensity measures  Multivariate seismic classifier  Seismic damage classification Damage detection  Earthquakes  Case-studies  Damage classification  Fragility estimation  Intensity measure  Multivariate seismic classifier  Network-based  Neural-networks  Predictive performance  Seismic damage  Seismic damage classification  Neural networks  artificial neural network  classification  earthquake damage  earthquake intensity  estimation method  real time  structural response",A neural network-based multivariate seismic classifier for simultaneous post-earthquake fragility estimation and damage classification,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013218477355743113,0.03046046457464798,0.009265190244793959,0.9796134846361266,ML
18060,"Fragility estimates of smart structures with sensor faults In this paper, the impact of sensor faults within smart structures is investigated using seismic fragility analysis techniques. Seismic fragility analysis is one of the methods used to evaluate the vulnerability of structural systems under a broad range of earthquake events. It would play an important role in estimating seismic losses and in the decision making process based on vibration control performance of the smart structures during seismic events. In this study, a three-story building employing a highly nonlinear hysteretic magnetorheological (MR) damper is analyzed to estimate the seismic fragility of the smart control system. Different levels of sensor damage scenarios for smart structures are considered to provide a better understanding of the expected fragility estimates due to the impact of sensor failures. Probabilistic demand models are constructed with a Bayesian updating approach while the seismic capacity of smart structures is estimated based on the approximate structural performance of semi-actively controlled structures. Peak ground acceleration (PGA) of ground motion is used as a measure of earthquake intensity. Then the fragility curves for the smart structures are developed and compared with those for the semi-active control systems with different levels of sensor damage scenarios. The responses of an uncontrolled structure are used as a baseline. It is shown from the simulations that the proposed methodology is effective in quantifying the impact of sensor faults within smart structures. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

19690,"Probabilistic Assessment of Torsional Buildings Asymmetry/irregularity is an undesired building characteristic that nevertheless exists commonly due to modern-day structural definitions. Asymmetry in plan, due to the uneven distribution of mass or stiffness can cause torsional coupling under seismic loads. A well-defined parameter that can sufficiently represent the damage of torsional buildings is non-existent, which may be why probabilistic seismic assessment methods such as fragility analyses have not been done for such buildings. The present study proposes 'Resultant Drift' as a parameter that can define the failure behaviour of asymmetric buildings and utilises the 2000 SAC FEMA method to analyse the seismic risk and develop fragility curves.

16910,"Development of fragility curves using high-dimensional model representation Fragility curves represent the conditional probability that a structure's response may exceed the performance limit for a given ground motion intensity. Conventional methods for computing building fragilities are either based on statistical extrapolation of detailed analyses on one or two specific buildings or make use of Monte Carlo simulation with these models. However, the Monte Carlo technique usually requires a relatively large number of simulations to obtain a sufficiently reliable estimate of the fragilities, and it is computationally expensive and time consuming to simulate the required thousands of time history analyses. In this paper, high-dimensional model representation based response surface method together with the Monte Carlo simulation is used to develop the fragility curve, which is then compared with that obtained by using Latin hypercube sampling. It is used to replace the algorithmic performance-function with an explicit functional relationship, fitting a functional approximation, thereby reducing the number of expensive numerical analyses. After the functional approximation has been made, Monte Carlo simulation is used to obtain the fragility curve of the system. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

17922,"Fragility analysis of R/C frame buildings based on different types of hysteretic model Estimation of damage probability of buildings under a future earthquake is an essential issue to ensure the seismic reliability. Fragility curves are useful tools for showing the probability of structural damage due to earthquakes as a function of ground motion indices. The purpose of this study is to compare the damage probability of R/C buildings with low and high level of strength and ductility through fragility analysis. Two different types of sample buildings have been considered which represent the building types mentioned above. The first one was designed according to TEC-2007 and the latter was designed according to TEC-1975. The pushover curves of sample buildings were obtained via pushover analyses. Using 60 ground motion records, nonlinear time-history analyses of equivalent single degree of freedom systems were performed using bilinear hysteretic model and peak-oriented hysteretic model with stiffness - strength deterioration for each scaled elastic spectral displacement. The damage measure is maximum inter-story drift ratio and each performance level considered in this study has an assumed limit value of damage measure. Discrete damage probabilities were calculated using statistical methods for each considered performance level and elastic spectral displacement. Consequently, continuous fragility curves have been constructed based on the lognormal distribution assumption. Furthermore, the effect of hysteresis model parameters on the damage probability is investigated.

22254,"Vulnerability assessment of reinforced concrete buildings subjected to seismically triggered slow-moving earth slides The objective of this paper is to develop an efficient analytical method for assessing the vulnerability of low-rise reinforced concrete buildings subjected to seismically induced slow-moving earth slides. Vulnerability is defined in terms of probabilistic fragility curves, which describe the probability of exceeding a certain limit state of the building, on a given slope, versus the Peak Horizontal Ground Acceleration (PHGA) at the assumed ""seismic bedrock"", allowing for the quantification of various sources of uncertainty. The proposed method is based on a two-step, uncoupled approach. In the first step, the differential permanent landslide displacements at the building's foundation level are estimated using a dynamic non-linear finite difference slope model. In the second step, the calculated differential permanent displacements are statically imposed at the foundation level to assess the building's response to differing permanent seismic ground displacements using a finite element code. Structural limit states are defined in terms of threshold values of strains for the reinforced concrete structural components. The method is applied to typical low-rise reinforced concrete frame buildings on shallow foundations with varying strength and stiffness characteristics (isolated footings and continuous slab foundation), standing near the crest of a relatively slow-moving earth slide. Two different slope models are selected representing a cohesive and a purely frictional soil material. The paper describes the method and the derived fragility curves for the selected building and slope typologies that could be used in quantitative risk assessment studies at site-specific and local scales. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

17462,"Evaluación probabilista del riesgo sísmico de estructuras con base en la degradación de rigidez Resumen El análisis dinámico incremental es una poderosa herramienta para evaluar la vulnerabilidad y el riesgo sísmico de edificios. Permite calcular el daño global de estructuras para diferentes aceleraciones máximas del terreno y representar este resultado por medio de curvas de daño. Dichas curvas se utilizan para evaluar el riesgo sísmico a nivel urbano. Aunque el uso de este método en un entorno probabilista requiere un considerable esfuerzo computacional, este debe ser el método de referencia para el cálculo de las mencionadas curvas. Sin embargo, resulta de interés práctico disponer de un método más sencillo que utilice, por ejemplo, el análisis estático no lineal incremental (pushover analysis) para evaluar la vulnerabilidad sísmica y el riesgo de los edificios, que permita obtener resultados similares a los obtenidos usando el análisis dinámico incremental. Haciendo referencia a los métodos basados en la capacidad y la demanda, habitualmente se han utilizado opiniones de expertos para definir los umbrales de los estados de daño a partir del punto de plastificación y del desplazamiento máximo espectral identificado en el espectro de capacidad bilineal. Por lo tanto, en el artículo se propone un nuevo procedimiento para la definición de los umbrales de los estados de daño, con base en la degradación de la rigidez de la estructura. El problema se aborda mediante un método totalmente probabilista utilizando la simulación por Monte Carlo con el fin de comparar de una manera rigurosa los resultados obtenidos con los proporcionados por el análisis dinámico incremental. The incremental dynamic analysis is a powerful tool for evaluating the seismic vulnerability and risk of buildings. It allows calculating the global damage of structures for different peak ground accelerations, PGA, and representing this result by means of damage curves. Such curves are currently used to obtain seismic risk scenarios at urban level. Even if the application of this method in a probabilistic environment requires a relevant computational effort, this has to be the reference method for determining those curves. Nevertheless, it would be of high practical interest to have a simpler method based, for instance, on pushover analysis, for assessing the seismic vulnerability and risk of buildings, which allows obtaining results similar to those based on the incremental dynamic analysis. Referring to the capacity-spectrum-based-methods, expert opinions have been used in previous researches for defining damage states thresholds starting from the yielding and the ultimate spectral displacement identified in the bilinear capacity spectrum. Therefore, we propose in this article a new procedure for defining the damage states thresholds, based on the stiffness degradation of reinforced concrete building, and a fully probabilistic approach is tackled by means of Monte Carlo simulations. It is demonstrated in the paper that the obtained results are in good agreement with those calculated using the incremental dynamic analysis.

17844,"Flood damage calculations via a RESTful API In Canada and across the globe, flooding has significantly increased in recent decades. Knowledge of the flood hazard alone (extent and frequency) does not provide enough information to the public safety community to make informed decisions regarding potential social and economic losses. While many programs have been developed for flood risk assessment, they require experienced personnel to prepare the data inputs, run and analyse the model outputs. As such, alternative, easy-to-use tools for risk assessment are appealing. We present in this paper a RESTful Application Program Interface (API) for building damage estimation. This API is a web-service which allows access to buildings damage calculations outside of a risk assessment program. It is designed to provide a point of entry for developers to programmatically access the underlying calculation tools to query, calculate and extract damage data directly into a users own software, tools or decision support systems. To validate the accuracy of results the damage data is compared to results from existing software for two communities in Eastern Canada. To illustrate the ease of use of the API, a Python script has been written which reads in a file containing the building information and pre-determined flood depths. This script builds the request for the API and saves the results: damage and exposure.

15891,"Bayesian networks for assessment of disruption to school systems under combined hazards Exposure of school buildings to floods and earthquakes poses significant risk to the vulnerable population of students and their education process. In regions of high exposure, these hazards may often act concurrently, whereby yearly flood events weaken masonry school buildings, rendering them more vulnerable to frequent earthquake shaking. This recurring damage, combined with other functional losses, ultimately result in disruption to education delivery. The socio-economic condition of the users-community also plays a role in the extent of such disruption. A complex problem of this nature demands consideration of a large number of dimensions, to estimate the impact to the school system infrastructure in a locality. To handle the qualitative and quantitative nature of these variables, a Bayesian network (BN) model is proposed representing multiple schools in a locality as a system. Three dimensions are considered to contribute to the system disruption, namely, schools’ physical functionality loss, accessibility and use loss, and social vulnerability. The impact is quantified through the probability of the system being in various states of disruption. The BN also explores mitigating measures, such as the mobility of students between schools in the system. The general methodology is illustrated by a case-study of school buildings in Guwahati, India, whereby the majority of buildings is constructed in confined masonry with varying level of seismic performance. The physical effects of combined flood and seismic action on confined masonry buildings is assessed by nonlinear numerical modelling, and their probabilistic occurrence is expressed in terms of fragility functions corresponding to varying flood depth and peak ground acceleration.

15146,"A generic physical vulnerability model for floods: review and concept for data-scarce regions The use of different methods for physical flood vulnerability assessment has evolved over time, from traditional single-parameter stage-damage curves to multi-parameter approaches such as multivariate or indicator-based models. However, despite the extensive implementation of these models in flood risk assessment globally, a considerable gap remains in their applicability to data-scarce regions. Considering that these regions are mostly areas with a limited capacity to cope with disasters, there is an essential need for assessing the physical vulnerability of the built environment and contributing to an improvement of flood risk reduction. To close this gap, we propose linking approaches with reduced data requirements, such as vulnerability indicators (integrating major damage drivers) and damage grades (integrating frequently observed damage patterns). First, we present a review of current studies of physical vulnerability indicators and flood damage models comprised of stage-damage curves and the multivariate methods that have been applied to predict damage grades. Second, we propose a new conceptual framework for assessing the physical vulnerability of buildings exposed to flood hazards that has been specifically tailored for use in data-scarce regions. This framework is operationalized in three steps: (i) developing a vulnerability index, (ii) identifying regional damage grades, and (iii) linking resulting index classes with damage patterns, utilizing a synthetic what-if analysis. The new framework is a first step for enhancing flood damage prediction to support risk reduction in data-scarce regions. It addresses selected gaps in the literature by extending the application of the vulnerability index for damage grade prediction through the use of a synthetic multi-parameter approach. The framework can be adapted to different data-scarce regions and allows for integrating possible modifications to damage drivers and damage grades.

In this study, the authors show the results of the damage assessment survey performed in the first days after the occurrence of the extreme event. Limited literature deals with damage assessment of European building types due to wind actions, and the available one does not consider building vulnerability as key factor in the structural response of existing structures subject to tornado hazard. In this paper, structural damages surveyed in reinforced concrete frame structures and masonry buildings, representative of common Italian building types, are critically discussed.

12870,"Empirical fragility curves for Italian URM buildings This paper illustrates the derivation of an empirical fragility model for residential unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings, calibrated on Italian post-earthquake damage data and compatible with the key features of the Italian national seismic risk platform. Seismic vulnerability is described by fragility functions for three vulnerability classes, then refined based on the building height. To this aim, a clustering strategy is implemented to merge predefined building typologies into vulnerability classes, based on the similarity of the observed seismic fragility. On the other side, a specific procedure is built up to determine the vulnerability composition of the exposed URM building stock, starting from national census data. The empirically-derived model was implemented into the national seismic risk platform and used, together with other vulnerability models, for assessing seismic risk in Italy. The results presented in this paper, consisting of refined typological fragility curves and fragility curves for vulnerability classes, can be also exploited for estimating both expected seismic damage and risk in sites with similar seismic hazard and building inventory.

12512,"A compendium of existing vulnerability and fragility relationships for flood: Preliminary results In the last decade, probabilistic approaches for flood risk assessment have emerged, often as an extension of more consolidated methods used in probabilistic seismic risk assessment. Nonetheless, only a few studies deal with best-practice methodologies for flood vulnerability assessment and existing approaches lack of an appropriate guidance for their selection. These concerns underline the need for a rational, integrated and complete compendium of all the existing flood-related vulnerability and fragility relationships to be used in a comprehensive probabilistic flood risk assessment framework. Following the same approach used in the guidelines recently developed by the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) Project, this paper presents a preliminary review of the state-of-art regarding existing empirical vulnerability and fragility curves in the context of flood risk. In particular, a worldwide overview is intended in terms of data sources, assets features and also statistical techniques employed for data collection and fitting. The research aims at providing a complete and flexible guide for selection of vulnerability and fragility curves for building structures. A discussion on data sources, building classification and considered features, and damage scales is presented, in order to evaluate the reliability, and at the same time the limitations, of different approaches and provide recommendation for future studies.

The prediction is performed via statistical relationship between multiple IMs (particularly advanced scalar parameters accounting for spectral shape over a range of periods) and various displacement-based engineering demand parameters (EDPs). Such statistical relationships are built on data obtained from analysis of the frames subjected to over nine hundred ground motion records by employing an innovative capacity spectrum method, introduced in the paper, which uses inelastic response spectra derived from actual earthquake accelerograms to estimate seismic demand and derive fragility curves. The outcomes of the present work are in a good agreement with previous investigations conducted by other researchers on selecting optimal IMs for predicting structural response by using full nonlinear dynamic analyses for different structural typologies.

21142,"Seismic vulnerability assessment of high-rise non-ductile RC buildings considering soil-structure interaction effects Traditionally fragility curves of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings are estimated with the assumption of fixed base structures. The objective of the present research is to study whether soil-structure interaction (SSI) and site effects may affect the seismic performance and vulnerability of reinforced concrete moment resisting frame (MRF) buildings and consequently modify the fragility curves. SSI is modeled applying the direct one-step approach considering either linear elastic or nonlinear soil behavior while site effects are inherently accounted for. To further examine the contribution of site and SSI effects, a two-step uncoupled approach is also applied, which takes into account site effects on the response of the fixed base structure, but neglects SSI effects. Additional analyses are performed investigating the influence of the soil depth and stratigraphy under nonlinear soil behavior on the seismic response and fragility of RC buildings. A 9-story RC MRF designed with low seismic code provisions is adopted as a reference structure. A comparative dynamic analysis is performed highlighting various trends in the seismic response of the considered SSI and fixed base systems. Fragility curves are derived as a function of rock outcropping peak ground acceleration for the immediate occupancy and collapse prevention limit states for the fixed base and SSI models based on the statistical exploitation of the results of incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) of the given structural systems.

16242,"Comparative assessment of empirical and mechanical approaches for the estimation of the seismic fragility of ordinary masonry buildings type of the inner central Italy The assessment of the built heritage vulnerability is a needful task to mitigate the seismic risk. At this aim, fragility functions estimate the probability of exceedance of a structure at discrete levels of ground motion. The paper focuses on the estimation of seismic fragility of unreinforced masonry buildings typical of the inner Central Italy. Fragility assessments were performed for selected ordinary buildings representative of the urban fabric of the Central Italy, hit by the 2016 earthquake recently. The buildings' stock belongs to a macro-typology defined by structural features, easily available from visual inspections and geometric surveys. The structural performances of the buildings are assessed by means of empirical and numerical approaches, based on a large portfolio of information gathered after the 2016 earthquake swarm. Lastly, the fragility curves for the macro-typology have been derived referred to the attainment of four limit states of interest. A comparison between the obtained results in terms of probabilities of exceedance underlines the main advantages and limitations of each approach in the seismic vulnerability prediction on large scale applications. © 2021 COMPDYN Proceedings.

17949,"Fragility and climate impact assessment of contemporary housing roof sheeting failure due to extreme wind The paper describes a risk analysis of the economic impact of damage to metal roofing of a typical contemporary (new) Australian house subject to extreme wind loading. The failure modes considered are roof cladding and batten-to-truss connection failures, with the effect of defective construction also considered. Monte-Carlo simulation and structural reliability methods are used to stochastically model spatially varying pressure coefficients, roof component failure, and load re-distribution across the roof. This spatial reliability analysis enables fragility curves to be developed that relate likelihood and extent of roof cover loss to gust wind speed. The annual economic risk is up to 0.3% of house replacement value. A typical house with construction defects increases economic risk more than sixfold when compared to the defect-free house.

17179,"Effect of building sample selection on seismic fragility curves for RC buildings at territorial scale A reliable estimate of the seismic vulnerability of building typological classes is a crucial issue to understand how to manage the limited funds available for the reduction of the social and economic losses caused by seismic events. In this context, the goal of this paper is to develop typological empirical fragility curves for reinforced concrete building classes at different damage states. The vulnerability probabilistic assessment is deduced starting from the damage scenario observed after the 2012 Emilia earthquake, available from the Da.D.O. platform. The element-level damage information for the different structural elements is used to define a global building damage state according to a damage index available in the literature. A single value of seismic demand is estimated for each locality and is associated with each building in that locality. Census data have been added to the detected typological building sample with the aim to account for uninspected buildings, and the effect on fragility curves due to the increased dataset is evaluated. Moreover, a completeness ratio is defined for each locality, and lower bounds on the locality seismic demand and completeness ratio are introduced to discard irrelevant damage data and evaluate the consequent effect on the damage state fragility curves. © 2021 COMPDYN Proceedings.

17842,"FLOOD DAMAGE ASSESSMENT: A REVIEW OF MULTIVARIATE FLOOD DAMAGE MODELS Nowadays, more emphasis is given to flood risk management for dealing with flood disasters. To assess flood risk, damage from a flood is a crucial component to be considered. Flood damage function is a commonly accepted approach for the estimation of flood damages worldwide, where it combines the element of hazard, vulnerability, and exposure. However, this method usually considers only the flood depth and the type of buildings at risk. The effect of other flooding conditions (impact parameters) and the resistance parameters to the degree of flood damages are normally neglected. Flood risk assessment should cover all damage dimensions to obtain an extensive description of flood damages. Multivariate damage modeling can be applied to examine the relationship between flood damages and other flood influencing factors. This paper presents a review of methods applied to generate multivariate flood damage models, which includes the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Bayesian Network (BN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and the Random Forest (RF) analysis. Moreover, the multivariate models are also found capable of generating synthetic data to counter the problems of flood damage data scarcity experienced by developing countries. Identifying damage influencing factors, especially resistance parameters is important as a comprehensive flood damage model based on the local conditions and property characteristics of the study area can assist in the future damage assessment works, as well as offer decision-makers with an indispensable tool for managing strategies related to flood risk.

20612,"Seismic fragility assessment for a class of RC school buildings in Italy leveraging detailed and reduced-order models A study is presented on the seismic fragility analysis of a class of existing RC school buildings in Puglia, Southern Italy. Firstly, we defined a taxonomy for identifying a homogenous building class, through the collection of typological data, such as construction age, number of storeys and construction materials. After, by means of the available Census data on Italian school buildings, we selected 735 units in the focused area to assembly a proper database to involve in the phase of numerical modelling and analysis. To assess fragility, we employed two modelling options: (a) a single-degree-of-freedom approach, by evaluating the backbone of the simplified models; (b) a multidegree-of-freedom approach, by means of some index buildings of the class for which a full knowledge of geometrical and mechanical properties is available, as well as their spatial nonlinear numerical models. Nonlinear time history analyses were performed on all simplified models to define specific class fragility, accounting for any source of variability (record-to-record and building-to-building). The results of the investigation are compared in terms of class fragility curves, in order to highlight the differences between the two modelling approaches. © 2021 COMPDYN Proceedings.

17340,"Empirical fragility assessment of residential buildings using data from the Emilia 2012 sequence of earthquakes In 2012, the Emilia-Romagna region in Italy was affected by ground shaking as well as widespread ground failure (mostly liquefaction) caused by a sequence of earthquakes. The fragility of the residential building inventory is empirically assessed here based on information from 39,087 buildings in 64 municipalities surveyed in order to assess their post-disaster usability. Key (and common) challenge with this type of large post-disaster databases is how best to treat the notable missing data error and address the non-representative sample. Fragility curves for buildings based on their construction material or age are constructed for areas affected by ground shaking and for areas ones affected by ground failure. As expected, old masonry buildings are the most vulnerable and reinforced concrete buildings are seen to be the least vulnerable. Both peak ground acceleration and peak ground velocity have been used to express the intensity measure type. Although, the former was found to fit the data best, it poorly predicted the probability of exceedance of extreme damage to ground failure for building classes associated with small sample sizes (e.g. RC buildings), highlighting the limitations of using non-representative samples in fragility assessment for extreme cases.

18202,"Ground motion characteristics of the 2015 gorkha earthquake, survey of damage to stone masonry structures and structural field tests On April 25, 2015, a M7.8 earthquake rattled central Nepal; ground motion recorded in Kantipath, Kathmandu, 76.86 km east of the epicenter suggested that the low-frequency component was dominant. We consider data from eight aftershocks following the Gorkha earthquake and analyze ground motion characteristics; we found that most of the ground motion records are dominated by low frequencies for events with a moment magnitude >6. The Gorkha earthquake devastated hundreds of thousands of structures. In the countryside, and especially in rural mountainous areas, most of the buildings that collapsed were stone masonry constructions. Detailed damage assessments of stone masonry buildings in Harmi Gorkha was done, with an epicentral distance of about 17 km. Structures were categorized as large, medium, and small depending on their plinth area size and number of stories. Most of the structures in the area were damaged; interestingly, all ridge-line structures were heavily damaged. Moreover, Schmidt hammer tests were undertaken to determine the compressive strength of stone masonry and brick masonry with mud mortar for normal buildings and historical monuments. The compressive strengths of stone masonry and brick masonry were found to be 12.38 and 18.75 MPa, respectively. Historical structures constructed with special bricks had a compressive strength of 29.50 MPa. Pullout tests were also conducted to determine the stone masonry-mud mortar bond strength. The cohesive strength of mud mortar and the coefficient of friction were determined. © 2015 Parajuli and Kiyono.

Seismic capacity of the two structures, at different damage states, is assessed through static push-over analyses, within the N2 spectral assessment framework. Infill panels' contribution in terms of strength and stiffness is explicitly taken into account in the analytical model. Damage States are defined according to a mechanical interpretation of EMS-98 scale. Fragility functions at each Damage State are obtained through the application of a Response Surface Method.

21987,"Tree-based flood damage modeling of companies: Damage processes and model performance Reliable flood risk analyses, including the estimation of damage, are an important prerequisite for efficient risk management. However, not much is known about flood damage processes affecting companies. Thus, we conduct a flood damage assessment of companies in Germany with regard to two aspects. First, we identify relevant damage-influencing variables. Second, we assess the prediction performance of the developed damage models with respect to the gain by using an increasing amount of training data and a sector-specific evaluation of the data. Random forests are trained with data from two postevent surveys after flood events occurring in the years 2002 and 2013. For a sector-specific consideration, the data set is split into four subsets corresponding to the manufacturing, commercial, financial, and service sectors. Further, separate models are derived for three different company assets: buildings, equipment, and goods and stock. Calculated variable importance values reveal different variable sets relevant for the damage estimation, indicating significant differences in the damage process for various company sectors and assets. With an increasing number of data used to build the models, prediction errors decrease. Yet the effect is rather small and seems to saturate for a data set size of several hundred observations. In contrast, the prediction improvement achieved by a sector-specific consideration is more distinct, especially for damage to equipment and goods and stock. Consequently, sector-specific data acquisition and a consideration of sector-specific company characteristics in future flood damage assessments is expected to improve the model performance more than a mere increase in data. © 2017.

17501,"Evaluation of damping modification factors for floor response spectra via machine learning model In the last few decades, the seismic performance of Non-structural components (NSCs) has been a subject of extensive research. The dynamic behavior of NSCs, can cause damage to buildings, resulting in severe financial losses, injuries, and death. The necessity of assessing the seismic demand on NSCs in seismic design cannot be overstated. Current building regulations include overly simple relationships for defining design inertia forces on non-structural acceleration-sensitive components. Building code formulations are frequently unable to forecast realistic accelerations of NSCs. Floor Response Spectra (FRS) approach determines the seismic demands on acceleration-sensitive NSCs better. In this study, elastic FRS at a floor level of a linear single-degree-of-freedom system is investigated under near-field earthquakes. Damping modification factors (DMFs) for the elastic FRS are calculated for the various damping ratios of the NSCs ranging from 0.1% to 30%, the tuning ratio (i.e., the ratio between the NSC vibration period, Ts, to the building structural period, Tp) ranging from 0.1 to 3, and the building structural period ranging from 0.5 s to 4 s with 0.5 s interval. Also, artificial neural networks (ANNs) were employed to generate an empirical expression to determine the DMFs for elastic FRS. The DMFs were observed to be highly dependent on the building structural period, damping ratio and the tuning ratio of the NSC. The proposed expression is then compared with the existing relations in the literature. The expression is further validated by comparing the predicted DMFs to those obtained from time-history analysis with different ground motion records used to build the model.

22101,"Urban Seismic Loss Estimation by Incorporating Ground-Motion Simulation, Site Effect, and Kriging Techniques: An Application in Singapore Regional seismic loss assessment of buildings requires ground-motion intensity measure (IM) maps. In this article, a new method to estimate the seismic structural losses of urban regions is developed. Unlike the IMs commonly predicted by ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs), this method focuses on generating IM maps based on ground-motion simulation, site-response analysis, and geostatistical approaches. The seismic structural loss estimates are conducted for the building inventory of Singapore under a deterministic Sumatran earthquake scenario with moment magnitude (M-w) 7.7. Based on the collected soil profiles in Singapore, site-response analyses are performed using the simulated bedrock motions. Kriging techniques are utilized to produce surface ground-motion intensity maps. The structural losses are then estimated using the simulated intensity maps, and the capacity and fragility curves provided in Hazards U.S. Multi-Hazard (HAZUS-MH). The estimated structural losses by this simulation-based method are compared systematically with those obtained by the GMPE-based loss estimation method.

17361,"Empirical seismic fragility assessment and optimal risk mitigation of building contents Building contents proved challenging in performance-based earthquake engineering frameworks because of the data scarcity. Despite the content seismic losses in the past two decades, the overall effectiveness of restrainers to contents has not been thoroughly investigated. This paper aims to provide a detailed analysis for assessing content damage, loss, and protection to better understand content risk and performance. In this paper, analytical fragility functions for rigid block-type contents are developed based on nonlinear time history analysis of four dynamic models to represent freestanding and anchored building contents with elastic-brittle restrainers considering multiple failure modes. The effectiveness of restrainers is quantified by the improvement of the fragility median. A simplified expression is proposed to estimate content lognormal fragility parameters based on a wide range of variables' correlation between contents' characteristics and restraint strength. The proposed simplified expression is adopted in FEMA P-58 loss assessment framework through a case study of a 4-story light-frame wood office building to estimate content dollar loss. To further investigate content risk mitigation, we used a quantitative loss assessment for multiple mitigation scenarios by anchoring different content types such as heavy, expensive, electrical, furniture, or glassware. It is found that elastic-brittle restrainers are more effective for rigid systems than flexible systems, and decision-makers should design restrainers based on a combination of block-like content and restrainer characteristics for efficient protection and life safety. For the case study, anchoring expensive components was the optimal mitigation scenario, which resulted in a 74% reduction in the average annual losses compared to freestanding contents.

19688,"Probabilistic assessment of the seismic risk based on stiffness degradation [Evaluación probabilista del riesgo sísmico de estructuras con base en la degradación de rigidez] The incremental dynamic analysis is a powerful tool for evaluating the seismic vulnerability and risk of buildings. It allows calculating the global damage of structures for different peak ground accelerations, PGA, and representing this result by means of damage curves. Such curves are currently used to obtain seismic risk scenarios at urban level. Even if the application of this method in a probabilistic environment requires a relevant computational effort, this has to be the reference method for determining those curves. Nevertheless, it would be of high practical interest to have a simpler method based, for instance, on pushover analysis, for assessing the seismic vulnerability and risk of buildings, which allows obtaining results similar to those based on the incremental dynamic analysis. Referring to the capacity-spectrum-based-methods, expert opinions have been used in previous researches for defining damage states thresholds starting from the yielding and the ultimate spectral displacement identified in the bilinear capacity spectrum. Therefore, we propose in this article a new procedure for defining the damage states thresholds, based on the stiffness degradation of reinforced concrete building, and a fully probabilistic approach is tackled by means of Monte Carlo simulations. It is demonstrated in the paper that the obtained results are in good agreement with those calculated using the incremental dynamic analysis. © 2013 CIMNE (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya).

19413,"Performance Assessment of Turkish Residential Buildings for Seismic Damage and Loss Estimation This study aims to present an integrated method in a probabilistic manner for seismic performance assessment of Turkish residential buildings, which can be used as a tool to estimate earthquake losses due to structural damage. In particular, the objective is to determine the performances of different types of residential buildings for predicting the potential seismic loss in terms of casualties (death toll) for a highly populated city in northwestern Turkey. The main phases of this study are seismic hazard, building performance in terms of fragility functions, and loss in terms of damage states of buildings and total number of casualties. To quantify the regional hazard, a probabilistic seismic hazard assessment approach is adopted. For different types of building structures, probabilities of satisfying predefined performance levels for a given hazard level are determined using appropriate fragility curve sets produced by using local characteristics. The results are expressed as expected losses in 50 years in terms of number of casualties obtained as a function of the estimated performance of building types under concern.

16186,"Collapse fragility curve development using Monte Carlo simulation and artificial neural network Seismic fragility curves represent likelihood of structures meeting various damage stages. Epistemic as well as aleatory uncertainties associated with seismic loads and structural behaviors are usually taken into account in order to analytically develop such curves. Such structural analyses are time-consuming, demanding extensive computational efforts. In this study, in order to reduce this endeavor, artificial neural network method is applied to develop structural seismic fragility curves under collapse damage state, considering effects of record-to-record variability and modeling parameter uncertainties. Structural analyses are performed for a limited number of scenarios of structures under a limited number of recorded strong ground motion records. Probability distribution for each modeling parameter was used to simulate each structure scenario. Incremental dynamic analysis was used to assess spectral acceleration associated with collapse limit state for each structure scenario. The results of the analyses were used to train and validate a three-layered artificial neural network, and Monte Carlo simulation is implemented based on trained neural network for a sample moment-resisting steel frame in order to derive collapse fragility curve.

21158,"Seismic Vulnerability Assessment of Historical Unreinforced Masonry Buildings in Osijek using Capacity Spectrum Method The limitation of deformation, the desired level of bearing capacity of the structural elements and the dissipation of the energy produced by an earthquake ensure sufficient bearing capacity, stiffness and ductility of structures. These requirements are met by buildings which are designed and constructed in accordance with the latest technical regulations for buildings exposed to the earthquake. Most of the existing buildings in the city of Osijek do not meet these requirements. It is possible to use a capacity spectrum method for the purpose of considering possible responses of such structures to earthquakes and their estimates of seismic vulnerability. Calculation of seismic vulnerability by this method is based on the expected behavior of the building, obtained by overlapping the demand curve and capacity curve. The performance point is the point at which the capacity curve intersects the reduced response curve, at which capacity and demand are equal. The values of spectral displacement obtained for the performance point of a specific building class are used as the input parameters for the fragility curve for different levels of damage. This method will be applied to the collected database of traditional unreinforced masonry buildings of the city Osijek in Croatia. The database is prepared and the main characteristics of the buildings are processed using geographic information system. © 2019 Polish Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

16748,"Definition of fragility curves through nonlinear static analyses: procedure and application to a mixed masonry-RC building stock Seismic risk analyses at large scale represents a fundamental support to effective mitigation policies. Evaluating fragility curves able to capture the huge variety of existing buildings is one key point of this analysis. Within this context, this paper proposes a procedure for the evaluation of the fragility curves that aims to limit the computational effort without losing the reliability of the achieved results. This is reached through the execution of a limited number of nonlinear static procedures based on the use of the sensitivity analysis carried out according to the simplified star design with central point approach. The main strength of the procedure is the ability to explicitly quantify the various contributions of uncertainty to the dispersion, associated to those on the structural capacity (taking into account both aleatory and epistemic sources) and on the seismic input. As known, the adoption of a nonlinear static approach for the seismic assessment implies various assumptions, such as the load pattern applied, the criteria adopted to compare the capacity and the demand, and the definition of the damage levels. All these issues potentially affect the reliability of the final fragility curves, which are defined through a proper combination of such various options or they can be selected based on the ones more representative of the expected behaviour of the class. To improve this aspect, the evidences from nonlinear dynamic analyses are used. The feasibility and effectiveness of the procedure is duly demonstrated in this paper through its application to a building stock typology, consisting of existing mixed masonry-reinforced concrete structures, representative of one of the largest portions of the existing residential buildings in Lisbon. The attention is focused only to the global in-plane behaviour by adopting as modelling approach the equivalent frame method, that has been proven particularly efficient and accurate enough in representing the nonlinear behaviour of the examined structures. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

13389,"Seismic fragility of low ductile reinforced concrete frame in malaysia Seismic vulnerability of low-ductile reinforced concrete (RC) frames which have not been designed for earthquake loads has been a concern for countries with low-to-medium seismicity like Malaysia. These types of structures represent the majority of existing buildings in Malaysia and their safety level is of interest for authorities to plan for their retrofit. This study is conducted to assess the vulnerability of low-ductile reinforced concrete frame in Malaysia when subjected earthquake records through the development of seismic fragility curves. Three types of structural models were designed for gravity and lateral loads based on the common practices in Malaysia which included RC frames with three, six, and nine stories. The structures were analyzed using incremental dynamic analysis (IDA). In addition, pushover analysis was used to determine inter-story drift demands. The earthquake records were divided into three groups based on their peak ground acceleration (PGA) to peak ground velocity (PGV) ratios. Three structural performance levels namely immediate occupancy (IO), life safety (LS), and collapse prevention (CP) were considered for the selected frames. The results showed that records with the low PGA/PGV ratios that represented far-field earthquakes imposed the highest level of damage to the low-ductile RC frames. It was observed that the probability of seismic induced damage increased as the height of structures increased. The three story RC frame showed brittle failure mechanism when subjected to employed earthquake records. The probability of exceeding CP level under far-field records and the PGA of 0.2g was more than 50% for three and nine story RC frames. It was concluded that three and nine stories RC frames constructed in the East Malaysia did not satisfy the no-collapse requirements and needed to be retrofitted. © IAEME Publication.

17996,"Fragility curves by SAC FEMA and ANN Method Performance-based seismic design is the modern approach to earthquake resistant design for buildings. Many parameters involved in seismic design have uncertainty associated with them. Characterizing the probabilistic nature of these parameters can be done through the use of â€˜Fragility Curvesâ€™. A fragility analysis assesses the probability that the seismic demand placed on the structure exceeds the capacity conditioned on a chosen IM representative of the seismic loading. Demand (D) and capacity (C) are assumed to follow a lognormal distribution, and the probability of exceeding a specific damage state for a particular component can be estimated with the standard normal cumulative distribution function as per Cornell et. al. (2002). There is a different approach for fragility analysis using by ANN (Artificial Neural Network Methodology). A two-dimensional building model is analyzed for a set of 30 ground motions, and in each case the peak demand measures (e.g., inter-storey drift etc.) are recorded. Thirty spectrum consistent (IS 1893:2002) time-history data are selected and used for the analyses. A four storeyed (G+3) RC frame designed as per relevant Indian standard is chosen for this study.

17817,"Fire risk analysis of residential buildings based on scenario clusters and its application in fire risk management This article presents building fire risk analysis model based on scenario clusters and its application in fire risk management of buildings. Building fire risk analysis is a process of understanding and characterizing the fire hazards, the unwanted outcomes that may result from the fire, and the probabilities of fire and unwanted outcomes occurring. The purpose is to evaluate and make a decision about the level of fire risk to determine whether to take appropriate risk management measures or not. Therefore, building fire risk analysis serves as a basis for fire risk management. In the paper, scenario clusters are constructed in the process of building fire risk analysis, and the number of deaths and directive property loss are selected as building fire risk indexes. Finally, the average fire risk of residential buildings is quantified in detail. With the types of detailed fire risk models developed here, fire risk management measures could be taken to improve the building fire safety grading and reduce fire risk levels and subsequent damage.

17944,"Fragility analysis of wide-beam infill-joist block RC frames [Yatik kirisli, tek dogrultulu dolgulu disli döseme betonarme çerçevelerin (asmolen çerçeveler) kirilganlik analizi] Wide-beam infill-joist block structures constitutes a significant sub-group of reinforced concrete structures in the Mediterranean basin. The dominant characteristic of these structures is the low lateral stiffness due to the shallow-wide beams. The earthquake performance proved that existing wide-beam frames had inferior seismic behavior. The purpose of the presented study is to develop fragility curves for the wide-beam infill-joist block structures. In order to reach the stated purpose, first a nonlinear spring that could represent the behavior of wide-beam column connections is adopted, a wide-beam reinforced concrete frame representing the typical Turkish practice is modeled and nonlinear time history analyses are performed. The deformation limits for the performance levels are identified through pushover analysis. The maximum deformations are recorded for every ground motion, and a set of fragility curves are produced for different sets of ground motion parameters. Purpose: The purpose of the presented study is to develop fragility curves for the wide-beam infill-joist block reinforced concrete structures. Theory and Methods: Nonlinear time history analyses are performed for the set of selected ground motions. The performance levels are identified through pushover analysis and fragility curves are produced for ground motion parameters. Results: Fragility curves obtained for the wide-beam RC frames presents a different characteristic than the curves obtained for the conventional frames. Conclusion: Results show that wide-beam RC frame buildings are seismically more vulnerable than the conventional deepbeam RC frame buildings based on structural models with similar properties. The possible reason seems to be low lateral stiffness of wide-beam frames that causes large lateral drift demands and therefore severe damage at the wide-beam column connections. © 2022 Gazi Universitesi Muhendislik-Mimarlik.

16099,"Census-Based Typological Damage Fragility Curves and Seismic Risk Scenarios for Unreinforced Masonry Buildings Seismic risk assessment has become a crucial issue for optimal management of economic resources allocated to mitigation. For this purpose, in the last decades, several research activities were aimed to update hazard, exposure, and vulnerability models that contribute to seismic risk assessment. From this perspective, the present work focuses on developing new empirical damage fragility curves for census-based typological unreinforced masonry buildings. In particular, damage data observed after the 2009 L’Aquila earthquake, Italy, related to almost 57,000 residential buildings, were used to calibrate the fragility functions. These data were complemented with the census data with the aim of obtaining an accurate estimation of the number of undamaged buildings. Damage fragility curves were identified for typological building classes, defined considering parameters present in both post-earthquake observations and census data with the aim of extending the results to the whole national territory. Six typological classes were defined considering the categories of the construction timespan and of the state of repair parameters. Then, a further distinction of the typological classes considering the number of stories parameter was included where relevant. The fragility curves were defined as a function of peak ground acceleration for five damage states, defined according to the European macroseismic scale. The results confirmed that older buildings are more vulnerable than newer ones and highlighted the crucial role of the state of repair on the damage fragility curves. Finally, the new set of damage fragility functions was uploaded in the Italian Risk Maps information technology platform, used by the Civil Protection Department for risk evaluation, as an exemplification of the potential application of the fragility curves. © 2022 by the authors.

15578,"Analysis of a detention basin impact on dike failure probabilities and flood risk for a channel-dike-floodplain system along the river Elbe, Germany Highly concentrated asset values are often protected by dikes stretching along the river course. During extreme floods, dikes may fail due to various breach mechanisms and cause considerable damage. Therefore detention basins are often additionally installed to reduce the flood risk for downstream communities. In such situations, however, the systemic performance of dikes and spatial redistribution of inundation patterns are often unknown. Intuitively expected effects such as more probable breaches downstream due to fewer breaches upstream and consequently higher conveyance of upstream reaches lack evidential proof. With a coupled probabilistic-deterministic 1D-channel - dike breach - 2D-inundation - flood damage model chain the impact of a detention basin on losses to residential buildings and agricultural crops is investigated. We demonstrate the changes in dike performance due to systemic load and relief along the river course on the Middle Elbe, Germany considering three breach mechanisms: overtopping, piping and slope micro-instability. The reduction of overtopping failures due to the detention basin resulted in the slightly increased breach probabilities due to piping and micro-instability farther downstream. Finally, the uncertainty in hazard and damage estimations are analysed using the Monte Carlo simulation and applying several damage models. Despite high uncertainties in flood hazard and damage estimations, we conclude that the risk reduction to residential buildings downstream of the detention basin exceeds the higher losses to agricultural crops within the filled detention area. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

17912,"Fragility analysis of flat-slab structures Flat-slab RC buildings exhibit several advantages over conventional moment-resisting frames. However, the structural effectiveness of flat-slab construction is hindered by its alleged inferior performance under earthquake loading. Although flat-slab systems are widely used in earthquake prone regions of the world, fragility curves for this type of construction are not available in the literature. This study focuses on the derivation of such fragility curves using medium-rise flat-slab buildings with masonry infill walls. The study employed a set of earthquake records compatible with the design spectrum selected to represent the variability in ground motion. Inelastic response-history analysis was used to analyze the random sample of structures subjected to the suite of records scaled in terms of displacement spectral ordinates, whilst monitoring four performance limit states. The fragility curves developed from this study were compared with the fragility curves derived for moment-resisting RC frames. The study concluded that earthquake losses for flat-slab structures are in the same range as for moment-resisting frames. Differences, however, exist. The study also showed that the differences were justifiable in terms of structural response characteristics of the two structural forms. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

19825,"Processing Italian damage data to derive typological fragility curves Typological fragility curves have been derived from post-earthquake survey data on building damage, collected in the areas affected by the most relevant Italian earthquakes of the last three decades. A complex and time consuming codification and reinterpretation work has been done on a set of about 150,000 survey building records, in order to define empirical damage probability matrices for several building typologies, characteristic of the Italian building stock. The obtained data have then been processed by advanced nonlinear regression methods in order to derive typological fragility curves. These curves, organised in five damage levels, provide useful information both for relative comparisons among typologies and for seismic risk analyses at different scales. By combining hazard definitions, fragility curves and inventory data, complete earthquake risk scenario studies can be performed, but even the single convolution of hazard and fragility allows to obtain typological risk maps, both for single damage state definitions and for concise average loss parameters. The very high potential of these results is shown by some applications reported in the paper. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

15755,"Assessment of damages caused by different flood types Comprehensive risk assessments are essential to integrated, efficient flood management. However, investigations concentrate mainly on scenarios of slowly rising riverine floods and their loss assessment. The common loss models are focused on the water level as the primary factor determining damage, although, for example during flash floods, the velocity might be much more important. To improve the knowledge about flood losses and the loss-influencing factors, 1697 households affected by the Elbe and Danube flood in 2002 were interviewed. Cases affected by high groundwater levels, riverine floods, flash floods and dyke breaches were identified and separately analyzed. The four flood types show significantly different impact characteristics concerning the factors of water level, flood duration, flow velocity and contamination. In addition, the resulting losses differ significantly. Common loss models tested, i.e. stage-damage curves, were as such not suitable to estimate losses due to dyke breaches and high groundwater levels. Therefore, new loss models should be developed for these special flood situations. flash floods  flood loss  high groundwater levels  dyke breaches  riverine floods  impact  stage-damage curve BUILDINGS",Assessment of damages caused by different flood types,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1939501922783452,0.3032066463051819,0.047014628031339246,0.005543646262655275,Empirical
18625,"Investigation of the Effect of Debris-Induced Damage for Constructing Tsunami Fragility Curves for Buildings Catastrophe models quantify potential losses from disasters, and are used in the insurance, disaster-risk management, and engineering industries. Tsunami fragility and vulnerability curves are key components of catastrophe models, providing probabilistic links between Tsunami Intensity Measures (TIMs), damage and loss. Building damage due to tsunamis can occur due to fluid forces or debris impact; two effects which have different implications for building damage levels and failure mechanisms. However, existing fragility functions are generally derived using all available damage data for a location, regardless of whether damage was caused by fluid or debris effects. It is therefore not clear whether the inclusion of debris-induced damage introduces bias in existing functions. Furthermore, when modelling areas likely to be affected by debris (e.g., adjacent to ports), it is not possible to account for this increased likelihood of debris-induced damage using existing functions. This paper proposes a methodology to quantify the effect that debris-induced damage has on fragility and vulnerability function derivation, and subsequent loss estimates. A building-by-building damage dataset from the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami is used, together with several statistical techniques advanced in the field of fragility analysis. First, buildings are identified which are most likely to have been affected by debris from nearby 'washed away' buildings. Fragility functions are then derived incorporating this debris indicator parameter. The debris parameter is shown to be significant for all but the lowest damage state (minor damage), and functions which incorporate the debris parameter are shown to have a statistically significant better fit to the observed damage data than models which omit debris information. Finally, for a case study scenario simulated economic loss is compared for estimates from vulnerability functions which do and do not incorporate a debris term. This comparison suggests that biases in loss estimation may be introduced if not explicitly modelling debris. The proposed methodology provides a step towards allowing catastrophe models to more reliably predict the expected damage and losses in areas with increased likelihood of debris, which is of relevance for the engineering, disaster risk-reduction and insurance sectors. tsunami damage  empirical fragility curves  great east Japan earthquake and tsunami 2011  debris  catastrophe modelling  vulnerability functions  loss estimation EAST JAPAN TSUNAMI  IMPACT",Investigation of the Effect of Debris-Induced Damage for Constructing Tsunami Fragility Curves for Buildings,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18662466689844068,0.28157391159312806,0.01371642216950428,0.0027818809885701455,Empirical

22252,"Vulnerability assessment of reinforced concrete buildings in Indonesia subjected to tsunami inundation forces Purpose: This paper aims to evaluate the vulnerability of typical low-rise reinforced concrete (RC) buildings located in Indonesia subjected to tsunami loading. Design/methodology/approach: The vulnerability of typical three-story RC buildings located in Indonesia subjected to tsunami loading is discussed using fragility curves. Buildings without openings in all stories and buildings with openings in the first story are considered. The fragility curves are obtained by performing tsunami pushover analysis for several load cases, using different tsunami load estimation standards and references. The generalized linear method is used as a curve fitting method to construct the fragility curves. Findings: The fragility curves show that the three-story RC buildings without openings in all stories subjected to tsunami loading have a high probability of collapse. Openings in the first story will reduce the vulnerability of the buildings. Originality/value: Fragility curves are obtained by carrying out tsunami pushover analysis to evaluate the vulnerability of typical three-story RC buildings located in Indonesia. The results of this study show the need to include tsunami loads in the design code for Indonesian buildings and the benefits of having openings in the first story of the building. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

By using probabilistic seismic demand model (PSDM), the seismic fragility assessment of the RC frame is demonstrated on RC frames. Probabilistic seismic demand model (PSDM) for RC frame structures was built to assess the safety levels of the actual RC frames representative of design and construction practices in the Wenchuan county town.

16836,"Developing fragility surfaces for more accurate seismic vulnerability assessment of masonry buildings Usual methods for the vulnerability assessment of buildings often result in fragility curves, with respect to one intensity-measure parameter like PGA or spectral displacement. However, the seismic loading is very complex and describing it with one parameter may result in neglecting other significant characteristics of the ground motion [1]. Thus, this study proposes a methodology to develop fragility surfaces, which express the probability of damage with respect to more than one parameter, in order to better account for uncertainties related to the hazard description. The proposed methodology is applied to a model of a two-story unreinforced masonry building (real structure tested on a shaking table by [2]) and the following steps are carried out: modeling the structure with TREMURI code [3] and static pushover analysis; developing a set of models with an aleatory distribution of mechanical properties; based on Latin hypercube sampling, performing hundreds of dynamic analyses (using real and synthetic accelerograms) and assessing the damage level from each analysis; studying the ground-motion parameters: clustering methods and correlation analyses help to select the appropriate couple of variables to use in the fragility surfaces; applying the kernel estimation of density in order to get a non-parametrical distribution of damage probability and interpolation into fragility surfaces; The proposed framework permits us to choose a couple of ground-motion parameters that are well correlated to the dynamic response of the studied building and, in the same time, are less inter-correlated. The obtained uncorrelated intensity-measures are then used to build unbiased two-variables fragility functions, based on the couple of parameters (PGD and PGA). A comparison between the one-parameter fragility curve and ""slices"" of the fragility surface shows that the use of a second ground-motion parameter delivers a clearer definition of the vulnerability: the different ""slices"" can be seen as confidence intervals that can be of great help to public planners, especially in the case of very low probabilities for instance (i.e., extreme events).

19081,"Neural networks for the rapid seismic assessment of existing moment-frame RC buildings The study presented in this paper analyses and investigates the possibility of introducing a general and rapid methodology based on an artificial neural network (ANN) to assess the seismic response of existing reinforced concrete (RC) buildings. Starting from investigations carried out on buildings located in the outskirts of Bologna, 928 finite element models have been developed on the basis of the most recurrent data. The input parameters representing the characteristics of the structures were systematically varied and, through modal dynamic and non-linear static analyses, the outputs representing the seismic response were recorded. The resulting dataset was used to create a function, based on ANN, that can reliably predict the seismic behaviour of a RC structure. Finally, by means of k-fold cross-validation, the instruction of the function was optimised and simultaneously verified, obtaining a coefficient of determination for the totality of the samples and the previously unseen cases of 0,94 and 0,88, respectively. The result obtained not only aims at enriching the existing framework on the subject, increasing the awareness of the seismic issues affecting this building typology, but also constitutes a prioritization system that could highlight the need for structural renovation.

15952,"Building and Validating Geographically Refined Hurricane Wind Risk Models for Residential Structures Accurate estimation of risk to residential structures from hurricane winds is critical for emergency planning and post-event recovery. Models based on fragility curves are widely used for assessing wind damage risk at the county and census tract levels. Large-scale evaluation of the predictive accuracy of these models has been hampered by the lack of detailed damage data. This paper has three aims: (1) to evaluate the predictive accuracy of fragility-curve-based models at the census tract level using a comprehensive damage data set for Harris County residences collected after Hurricane Ike in 2008, (2) to demonstrate the need for geographically refined models of wind damage risk at spatial scales of 1-km(2) blocks and to analyze the performance of fragility-curve models at that level, and (3) to explore the sources of errors made by fragility-curve-based models at the census tract and 1-km(2)-block level using a statistical machine learning model constructed from 21 potential explanatory variables.

17855,"Flood risk assessment and coping capacity of floods in central Vietnam In the perspective of improving and disseminating risk assessment methodologies and rise preparedness of people to flood hazard this paper presents flood hazard maps estimated in the Quang Ngai province, in central Vietnam, for different return periods in terms of depth, duration and velocity using the FLO-2D, hydrodynamic model with a 90m×90m resolution grid. Then, based on the vulnerability functions determined from field surveys and the feedback to 400 questionnaires distributed to people regarding residential areas, paddy rice, road networks and the number of deaths and injuries, the total amount of tangible and intangible damage at each point in the study area is estimated and mapped, indicating risk levels and expected annual damage in case of flooding. The resulting damage functions are quite different from others available in the literature, as a result of the adaptive capacity and the resilience of the population to floods in the investigated area. Damage functions to buildings, agricultural areas, road infrastructures and people are normalised with respect to mean flooding depth and flooding hazard so that they can be generalized to areas with similar geographical conditions. In this way, a more comprehensive knowledge on the negative effects of floods is carried out, providing an important input to flood management plans in order to mitigate flood damage in tropical areas similar to the Quang Ngai province.

19796,"Probabilistic seismic performance assessment of code-compliant multi-story RC buildings Fragility analyses are conducted in this study to evaluate the relative seismic safety margins of seismic code-designed multi-story reinforced concrete (RC) buildings with varying input motion intensity, ductility level and configuration. Structural variations are accounted for by using twelve buildings [13] with diverse structural systems, heights and ductile detailing. The design peak ground acceleration (PGA) is also varied. The reference structures also include regular and irregular buildings in order to cover a wide spectrum of contemporary mid-rise buildings. Incremental dynamic analyses (IDAs) are deployed using the twelve inelastic fiber-based simulation models of the reference structures and sixty natural ground motions recorded on different soil conditions with a wide range of spectral amplifications. The regression analyses of the selected response quantities show that the soil condition has a marginal effect on the demand-ground motion intensity relationships when adopting spectral acceleration to characterize the ground shaking intensity. The damage state probabilities of wall-frame structures designed to high PGA and ductility levels do not satisfactorily achieve the most favorable safety objectives. Fragilities are reduced by decreasing the design PGA due to the higher contribution of gravity loads to the details of the building design. Using extensive results from twelve buildings subjected to sixty ground motions, a relationship is proposed to enable the quantifying of the Life Safety limit state probabilities of code-compliant mid-rise RC buildings. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

20235,"Scoping review of methodologies for assessing building vulnerabilities and Tsunami-induced damages Coastal areas, while generally favoured as the focal point for human developments and socioeconomic activities, are often at a higher risk for disasters due to higher vulnerability and exposure to hazardous natural phenomenon including tsunami. Presently, a multitude of methods and tools are available to assess building vulnerabilities and potentially estimate damages or associated losses that can be caused by tsunami disasters particularly on buildings. A scoping review was conducted for these tools which include tsunami damage and loss estimation models, intensity scales, fragility curves, and vulnerability indices in order to gauge the current breadth and depth of knowledge regarding tsunami-induced building damages and factors influencing their severity. A total of 26 articles were selected for review following screening processes of an initial 111 search hits across three databases. Different types of available methodologies offer varying usage, parameters and applicability in classifying building vulnerabilities and/or estimating building damages and associated losses. The findings are tabulated to summarise identified parameters and allow easier comparison between the methodologies reviewed, followed by a discussion on the diverse tools available.

15719,"Assessing the impact of ground-motion variability and uncertainty on empirical fragility curves Empirical fragility curves, constructed from databases of thousands of building-damage observations, are commonly used for earthquake risk assessments, particularly in Europe and Japan, where building stocks are often difficult to model analytically (e.g. old masonry structures or timber dwellings). Curves from different studies, however, display considerable differences, which lead to high uncertainty in the assessed seismic risk. One potential reason for this dispersion is the almost universal neglect of the spatial variability in ground motions and the epistemic uncertainty in ground-motion prediction. In this paper, databases of building damage are simulated using ground-motion fields that take account of spatial variability and a known fragility curve. These databases are then inverted, applying a standard approach for the derivation of empirical fragility curves, and the difference with the known curve is studied. A parametric analysis is conducted to investigate the impact of various assumptions on the results. By this approach, it is concluded that ground-motion variability leads to flatter fragility curves and that the epistemic uncertainty in the ground-motion prediction equation used can have a dramatic impact on the derived curves. Without dense ground-motion recording networks in the epicentral area empirical curves will remain highly uncertain. Moreover, the use of aggregated damage observations appears to substantially increase uncertainty in the empirical fragility assessment. In contrast, the use of limited randomly-chosen un-aggregated samples in the affected area can result in good predictions of fragility. © 2014 The Authors.

21113,"Seismic vulnerability assessment methodology for historic masonry buildings in the near-field areas Timisoara is the biggest city located in the Banat seismic area, the second most important seismic zone of Romania. The specificity of the area is represented by shallow earthquakes of crustal type, with small focal depths and a PGA = 0.20 g. Because Timisoara was declared the European Capital of Culture 2021, it is mandatory to assess the seismic vulnerability of its most sensitive areas and to design potential losses scenario. This study also provides useful data for the local authorities, helping them develop/improve the prevention and intervention plans. The paper focusses on the analysis of two historical urban districts, likely to be among the most attractive tourist areas. The study aims to assess the seismic vulnerability of the districts in a quick and simplified way, seeks to identify the exposure of the city, and also to provide losses statistics for a specific seismic scenario. The empirical seismic vulnerability assessment methodology is based on European studies and is applied for more than 100 historic buildings. Our assessment analysis aims to adapt the existing seismic assessment methodologies to the near-field earthquake’s effects. That is why a new formula is proposed to correlate the empirical vulnerability curves with the actual damage level. The real damage state was observed on similar historical masonry buildings during the site inspection and after the past earthquakes in nearby areas. Besides, a new failure mechanism is highlighted based on the investigation of the effects of previous near-field earthquakes in the Banat seismic region.

Different sources of uncertainty, both epistemic and aleatory, affecting the behaviour of these unreinforced masonry buildings are discussed and treated with a probabilistic procedure. The fragility curves determined for the different classes of buildings are compared and then combined to define the final fragility curves for these unreinforced masonry buildings.

15698,"Are flood damage models converging to ""reality""? Lessons learnt from a blind test Effective flood risk management requires a realistic estimation of flood losses. However, available flood damage estimates are still characterized by significant levels of uncertainty, questioning the capacity of flood damage models to depict real damages. With a joint effort of eight international research groups, the objective of this study was to compare, in a blind-validation test, the performances of different models for the assessment of the direct flood damage to the residential sector at the building level (i.e. microscale). The test consisted of a common flood case study characterized by high availability of hazard and building data but with undisclosed information on observed losses in the implementation stage of the models. The nine selected models were chosen in order to guarantee a good mastery of the models by the research teams, variety of the modelling approaches, and heterogeneity of the original calibration context in relation to both hazard and vulnerability features. By avoiding possible biases in model implementation, this blind comparison provided more objective insights on the transferability of the models and on the reliability of their estimations, especially regarding the potentials of local and multivariable models.

20769,"Seismic performance analysis of the masonry buildings, typical of the Eixample district of Barcelona In this work a study about the vulnerability and seismic risk of the unreinforced masonry buildings, widely, existent in the Eixample district of Barcelona, Spain, is carried out. The buildings, here, analyzed are real and detailed structural drawings and reports have been used to model them. The seismic risk is evaluated by means of a mechanical model, based in the Capacity Spectrum Method. The seismic demand is described by elastic response spectrum defined by the Eurocode-8. Fragility curves are obtained from a nonlinear analysis, considering the capacity spectra. Expected seismic damage is gotten with the damage probability matrices. The analysis of the buildings has been performed by TreMuri program by means of a macro-element model. The results shown a considerable vulnerability in this type of buildings, therefore, in spite of the seismic hazard, the expected seismic risk is significant. masonry  vulnerability  fragility  capacity  seismic damage None","Seismic performance analysis of the masonry buildings, typical of the Eixample district of Barcelona",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4686682475867449,0.008924587435825377,0.0914978883497221,0.03300026025992466,Analytical
15816,"Assessment on combined effects of multiple engineering demand parameters (MEDP) contributing on the shape of fragility curve There is saying that earthquakes do not kill people however, the structures do, therefore, the earthquake mitigation becomes vital for the structure located in the earthquake-prone region. One such tool for the risk investigation is fragility analysis. It shows the probability of exceedance (POE) of certain damage level at particular intensity measures (IM). The method at first used for the nuclear power plants in 1984 and from 1990 its utilization was connected in building too. In the present work, the four story reinforced concrete (RC) framed residential building with different bay ratios such as 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00 considered. The Non-Linear Time History Analysis (NLTHA) carried out and the inelastic behavior of the building is captured in the form of damage measures such as maximum inter-story drift ratio (MIDR), roof displacement (Δ), and the joint rotation (Ѳ). The two types of fragility curves has been obtained such as (1) considering the effects of only MIDR, and (2) considering the combined effects of MIDR, Δ, and Ѳ. However, past work by researchers is mostly dealing with the former type of fragility assessment. While for later type of fragility curve, limited work has been done. This paper presents the effects of the bay ratio (plan aspect ratio) in the fragility curve. It concluded that, combining the effects of response parameters has tremendous effect on the shape of the fragility curve and its effect must be considered in the study of fragility analysis. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

22177,"Validation and extension of a statistical usability model for unreinforced masonry buildings with different ground motion intensity measures Predicting the usability of a building, i.e. its condition of being occupiable after a seismic event, is relevant both in a post-emergency situation and within a risk-reduction policy. In the past an empirical model was proposed, involving the computation of a usability index based on macroseismic intensity and on seven building parameters, combined by means of regression coefficients and weights. The statistical model was calibrated on data of about 60,000 buildings affected by the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake in Italy. Therefore, it is useful to validate the model against data from the 2002 Molise earthquake in Italy. Good agreement between predicted and observed usability is shown, despite the fact that in 2002, macroseismic intensity was attributed to an entire municipality instead of a more limited area. Moreover, given the current availability of the shakemaps for the 2009 event, a novel model replacing conventional macroseismic intensity by an instrumental intensity measure is proposed. Three ground motion parameters are considered here: peak ground acceleration, peak ground velocity, and spectral pseudoacceleration at a period of vibration of 0.3 s. The model has been streamlined by reducing the building parameters from seven to five: building position within the structural aggregate, roof type, construction timespan, structural class, and pre-existing damage to structural elements. Peak ground acceleration and spectral pseudoacceleration are shown to be less effective than peak ground velocity in predicting observed usability. Therefore, usability probability matrices are computed in terms of peak ground velocity; the model is presented with all necessary coefficients and weights, and a worked-out example shows how to apply the procedure.

20627,"Seismic fragility assessment of existing sub-standard low strength reinforced concrete structures An analytical seismic fragility assessment framework is presented for the existing low strength reinforced concrete structures more common in the building stock of the developing countries. For realistic modelling of such substandard structures, low strength concrete stress-strain and bond-slip capacity models are included in calibrating material models. Key capacity parameters are generated stochastically to produce building population and cyclic pushover analysis is carried out to capture inelastic behaviour. Secant period values are evaluated corresponding to each displacement step on the capacity curves and used as seismic demand. A modified capacity demand diagram method is adopted for the degrading structures, which is further used to evaluate peak ground acceleration from back analysis considering each point on the capacity curve as performance point. For developing fragility curves, the mean values of peak ground acceleration are evaluated corresponding to each performance point on the series of capacity curves. A suitable probability distribution function is adopted for the secant period scatter at different mean peak ground acceleration values and probability of exceedance of limit states is evaluated. A suitable regression function is used for developing fragility curves and regression coefficients are proposed for different confidence levels. Fragility curves are presented for a low rise pre-seismic code reinforced concrete structure typical of developing countries. © 2015, Institute of Engineering Mechanics, China Earthquake Administration and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. analytical fragility  brittle  capacity  damage index  demand  non-engineered  variability Bond strength (materials)  Concrete buildings  Concrete construction  Concretes  Damage detection  Developing countries  Distribution functions  Probability distributions  Seismology  Structural analysis  analytical fragility  brittle  capacity  Damage index  demand  non-engineered  variability  Reinforced concrete",Seismic fragility assessment of existing sub-standard low strength reinforced concrete structures,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7010917255432044,0.1565842212810284,0.029544413035879756,0.007890979908216753,Analytical
19830,"Progressive collapse fragility of reinforced concrete framed structures through incremental dynamic analysis In conventional design approaches, structural safety is assessed without considering extreme load conditions that may cause global system collapse as a consequence of local failures in a component or localized portion of the structure. Even when extreme conditions are taken into account, structural safety is not probabilistically assessed and controlled, thus neglecting uncertainties in loads and system capacity. A few studies have been carried out so far, emphasizing the need for probabilistic risk assessment and management of structures to disproportionate (or progressive) collapse. To this aim, fragility analysis may be used to predict the probability of progressive collapse given that local damage has occurred. This approach is a well-established tool in earthquake engineering and explicitly accounts for uncertainties in both demand and capacity, providing the probability of failure as a function of a given intensity measure. In this paper, fragility functions for low-rise reinforced concrete (RC) framed building structures are presented to be implemented in progressive collapse risk assessment. Two building classes representative of European buildings designed for gravity loads and earthquake resistance in accordance with Eurocodes 2 and 8, respectively, were investigated. Fiber-based finite element (FE) models were developed and integrated with numerical techniques able to simulate the removal of first-story columns within an open source platform. Nonlinear response, resisting mechanisms and damage patterns under sudden column loss scenarios were reproduced at both local and global structural levels. Based on statistics and probability distribution functions for geometry, material properties and loads of the case-study building classes, Monte Carlo simulation was performed to generate random realizations of structural models. Fragility functions at multiple damage states show a significant influence of both seismic design/detailing and secondary beams on robustness of the case-study RC building classes.

15537,"An innovative variable target time method for probabilistic-based seismic performance assessment of multi-storey buildings Incremental dynamic analysis is one of the most widely used methods to develop fragility curves due to its ability to deal with various inherent uncertainties in the prediction of earthquake recurrence and characteristics. The dependence of the results to the selected ground motion records, uncertainties associated with the selection of appropriate earthquake input records and high computational costs are among the challenges limit the practical applications of this method. In this study, an innovative variable target time (VTT) method is developed based on the concept of endurance time (ET) analysis for structural reliability assessment of 3D multi-storey structures. A novel low-computational cost process is proposed to develop the database of desired statistical population and estimate the probabilities for constant hazard levels (EDP-based method) by taking into account the uncertainties in the frequency content of the input earthquakes. To verify the accuracy of the outcomes, the results are compared with the fragility curves derived based on different damage levels (IM-based method) and Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA) for moment-resisting steel and tunnel-from concrete 3D structures with 5- and 10-storeys. The results indicate that the proposed method is capable of providing highly accurate probabilistic models for structural performance under different levels of earthquake intensity. For the selected steel moment-resisting structures, the maximum difference in the reliability results obtained by the two methods of analysis for the Immediate Occupancy (IO), Life Safety (LS), and Collapse Prevention (CP) performance levels under the Design Basis Earthquake (DBE) and the Maximum Considered Earthquake (MCE) are around 2, 7 and 5%, respectively. Similarly, the reliability results for the 3D tunnel-from concrete structures show around 6, 7, and 6% errors between the two analysis methods for the IO, LS and CP performance levels, respectively. The proposed method reduces the computational costs of the IDA-based methods by 80%, and hence, can be considered as a suitable alternative for the conventional methods to develop fragility curves of 3D structures. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd EDP-Based method  Endurance time analysis  Fragility curves  IM-Based method  Incremental dynamic analysis  Reliability analysis Concretes  Cost benefit analysis  Earthquakes  Population statistics  Structural analysis  Uncertainty analysis  Computational costs  EDP-based method  Endurance time  Endurance time analyse  Fragility curves  IM-based method  Incremental dynamic analysis  Moment resisting  Time analysis  Uncertainty  Reliability analysis",An innovative variable target time method for probabilistic-based seismic performance assessment of multi-storey buildings,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18382597352679017,0.01619493505545201,0.022302135534572193,0.01433781802481761,Analytical
22040,"Typological Seismic Risk Maps for Italy This paper describes the methodology followed to derive typological seismic risk maps for Italy and then presents the results. In its classical definition, seismic risk is obtained from the convolution of hazard, vulnerability and exposure. Due to the absence of reliable data on exposure for the entire Italian territory, this study proposes typological seismic risk maps, obtained by simply convolving hazard and vulnerability for several building typologies characteristic of the Italian building stock. A specific hazard study in terms of PGA has been carried out. The results have then been convolved with empirical typological fragility curves, that were derived from data collected during post-earthquake surveys after the main Italian events of the last 30 years. Useful applications can be found for the typological seismic risk maps, both for risk mitigation strategies and for purely economical evaluations (e.g., insurance and reinsurance studies).

19749,"Probabilistic methods for the estimation of potential seismic damage: Application to reinforced concrete buildings in Turkey Three probabilistic methods, for the prediction of potential seismic damage to low and mid-rise reinforced concrete buildings in Turkey, are presented. As the first method, "" best estimate"" damage probability matrices for each seismic zone are developed by combining expert opinion and the damage statistics compiled from the recent earthquakes occurred in Turkey. Second method involves a reliability-based model, which treats the earthquake force and seismic resistance as random variables. This model expresses potential seismic damage in the form of a damage ratio distribution, which is a function of modified Mercalli intensity or peak ground acceleration. As the third methodology, discriminant analysis technique is utilized to carry out a statistical analysis on the damage data compiled during recent earthquakes that occurred in Turkey. Based on the classification procedure involved in this technique, the damage state probabilities corresponding to different modified Mercalli intensity levels are obtained. These three methods are applied on the building damage databases compiled in the aftermath of several recent earthquakes in Turkey: 1992 Erzincan, 1995 Dinar, and 1999 Duzce earthquakes.

22207,"Volume loss fatality model for as-built and retrofitted clay brick unreinforced masonry buildings damaged in the 2010/11 Canterbury earthquakes Building volume loss can be directly correlated with earthquake fatalities and is therefore considered to be a better damage descriptor for estimating risk to occupants than traditional damage states. Empirical volume loss studies are limited and the study presented herein represents what is likely the first attempt to develop a relationship between commercial unreinforced brick masonry (URBM) buildings attributes, ground motion, and fatalities based on empirical data.

19642,"Predictive applications of australian flood loss models after a temporal and spatial transfer In recent decades, considerably greater flood losses have increased attention to flood risk evaluation. This study used data-sets collected from Queensland flood events and investigated the predictive capacity of three new Australian flood loss models to assess the extent of physical damages, after a temporal and spatial transfer. The models’ predictive power is tested for precision, variation, and reliability. The performance of a new Australian flood loss function was contrasted with two tree-based damage models, one pruned and one un-pruned. The tree-based models are grown based on the interaction of flood loss ratio with 13 examined predictors gathered from flood specifications, building characteristics, and mitigation actions. Besides an overall comparison, the prediction capacity is also checked for some sub-classes of water depth and some groups of building-type. It has been shown that considering more details of the flood damage process can improve the predictive capacity of damage prediction models. In this regard, complexity with parameters with low predictive power may lead to more uncertain results. On the other hand, it has also been demonstrated that the probability analysis approach can make damage models more reliable when they are subjected to use in different flooding events. © 2018 The Author(s).

20341,"Seismic capacity and vulnerability assessment considering ageing effects: case study-three local Portuguese RC buildings A high percentage of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings in Portugal were designed and built before the introduction of modern seismic codes. This research aims to assess the seismic capacity and vulnerability of RC buildings in the city of Lisbon. For that purpose, nonlinear static procedures have been used and fragility curves have been developed. These buildings are reaching the end of their nominal life. Therefore, ageing effects have been taken into account, as well as the presence of smooth rebar. To do so, a sensitivity analysis has been performed by considering the chloride-induced corrosion of the reinforcement steel rebar and the degradation of the concrete cover. To illustrate the effects of ageing and the procedure adopted for the seismic fragility assessment of old RC structures, three RC buildings with masonry infills have been selected as case studies. They were all built between 1960 and 1980, and they are representative of the current building stock in Lisbon. The seismic capacity of the buildings has been determined by means of nonlinear static analyses of three-dimensional numerical models. The N2 method and its extended version have been considered to determine the target displacement. The seismic safety of the buildings has been estimated in terms of the demand/capacity ratio for each vertical structural element (columns and walls) according to the bending and the shear failures. Then, a set of fragility curves has been developed for all buildings to represent the probability of RC elements reaching or exceeding the significant damage limit state. Results have shown that the concrete strength degradation has had more influence than reduction of the rebar diameter in the seismic capacity. When considering steel corrosion, it has been demonstrated that the corrosion rate has reduced the capacity more than the time of exposure. It can be concluded that ageing affects the seismic behaviour of RC structures, increasing the vulnerability of these buildings.

18601,"Introducing loss transfer functions to model seismic financial loss: A case study of Iran Vulnerability curves in seismic risk studies, represent the relation between mean damage or loss ratio and some earthquake intensity parameter(s). Mostly, these curves are developed based on observed damage ratios caused by actual events or analytic evaluation of seismic performance of different building typologies. Exclusively employing these models to estimate the financial loss by considering the damage ratios as the economic loss ratios, disregards the fact that beyond some physical damage levels the structures becomes practically irreparable and a total loss must be assumed accordingly. Moreover, the incurred economic loss to the asset and the repair cost are not differentiable. In this paper, a method is introduced in order to convert the physical damage ratio into - economic loss considering the definitions of physical damage states and total loss thresholds. Using these curves and considering the physical vulnerability functions and their variations, the economic vulnerability curves are developed. As a case study for model implementation, the seismic loss curves and maps are obtained using the OpenQuake platform for the residential building stock of Iran, simulating 100,000 years of events. The findings reveal an average annual damage of 9.9 million square meters requiring US$ 2.7 billion equivalent to 0.57% of total assets value, to repair or to reconstruct the damaged buildings to return to the status quo ante and a total of US$ 3.3 billion including the betterment costs.

15316,"A proposed methodology for deriving tsunami fragility functions for buildings using optimum intensity measures Tsunami fragility curves are statistical models which form a key component of tsunami risk models, as they provide a probabilistic link between a tsunami intensity measure (TIM) and building damage. Existing studies apply different TIMs (e.g. depth, velocity, force etc.) with conflicting recommendations of which to use. This paper presents a rigorous methodology using advanced statistical methods for the selection of the optimal TIM for fragility function derivation for any given dataset. This methodology is demonstrated using a unique, detailed, disaggregated damage dataset from the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami (total 67,125 buildings), identifying the optimum TIM for describing observed damage for the case study locations. This paper first presents the proposed methodology, which is broken into three steps: (1) exploratory analysis, (2) statistical model selection and trend analysis and (3) comparison and selection of TIMs. The case study dataset is then presented, and the methodology is then applied to this dataset. In Step 1, exploratory analysis on the case study dataset suggests that fragility curves should be constructed for the sub-categories of engineered (RC and steel) and non-engineered (wood and masonry) construction materials. It is shown that the exclusion of buildings of unknown construction material (common practice in existing studies) may introduce bias in the results; hence, these buildings are estimated as engineered or non-engineered through use of multiple imputation (MI) techniques. In Step 2, a sensitivity analysis of several statistical methods for fragility curve derivation is conducted in order to select multiple statistical models with which to conduct further exploratory analysis and the TIM comparison (to draw conclusions which are non-model-specific). Methods of data aggregation and ordinary least squares parameter estimation (both used in existing studies) are rejected as they are quantitatively shown to reduce fragility curve accuracy and increase uncertainty. Partially ordered probit models and generalised additive models (GAMs) are selected for the TIM comparison of Step 3. In Step 3, fragility curves are then constructed for a number of TIMs, obtained from numerical simulation of the tsunami inundation of the 2011 GEJE. These fragility curves are compared using K-fold cross-validation (KFCV), and it is found that for the case study dataset a force-based measure that considers different flow regimes (indicated by Froude number) proves the most efficient TIM. It is recommended that the methodology proposed in this paper be applied for defining future fragility functions based on optimum TIMs. With the introduction of several concepts novel to the field of fragility assessment (MI, GAMs, KFCV for model optimisation and comparison), this study has significant implications for the future generation of empirical and analytical fragility functions. © 2016, The Author(s).

19297,"On the site-amplification and soil-structure interaction in URM structures: Use of fragility curves to assess the simplified code-approach The paper investigates the effects of site-amplification and soil-foundation-structure interaction (SFS) on the fragility curves of a real unreinforced masonry (URM) structure. The building is inspired to a school with an irregular T-shape plan and is modelled according to the equivalent frame approach. The structure was ideally placed on a stiff rock outcrop (case FB A) or settled on four different soft soil profiles, including its real foundation subsoil. In the latter cases the base of the structural model was assumed as fixed (FB C) or endowed with springs (CB C) simulating the soil-foundation dynamic impedance. To evaluate the fragility curves, the corresponding structural models were analysed through non-linear dynamic analyses under 136 input motions, propagated in 1D soil models reproducing the selected profiles for FB C and CB C. The results were compared in the paper in terms of: -fragility curves calculated for five damage levels (defined to be conceptually consistent with those of the EMS98 scale) and expressed as a function of different intensity measures of the input motion; - average damage derived as a weighted average of the probability of failure associated to all the damage levels. The comparison among the results of the different models highlights the expected increase of damage due to site effects and a beneficial effect of soil-structure interaction, mainly due to the increment of damping associated to the additional energy dissipated by the soil-foundation system. Finally, the average damage of FB C and CB C models were compared with those obtained from the fragility curves of a fixed base system in which site effects are considered through the conventional coefficients proposed in Codes (e.g. by the Eurocode 8), that neglect SFS. This latter approach is that followed in the current practice. The comparison demonstrates that the Code-based approach underestimates the fragility especially at high damage levels. © 2021 COMPDYN Proceedings.

18087,"Fragility relationships for populations of woodframe structures based on inelastic response In the absence of comprehensive and statistically viable observational damage data, there is a pressing need for simulation-based fragility relationships for populations of structures so as to improve the reliability of earthquake loss assessment studies. In this article, improved fragility relationships for woodframe structures are developed based on inelastic response. Capacity curves are obtained from detailed finite element models, demand is simulated by synthetically generated earthquake ground motions representing a probable earthquake in the Central USA, and structural assessment is carried out using an advanced capacity spectrum method (CSM) presented elsewhere. Thus, all the required components of fragility analysisnamely, capacity, demand, and structural responseare founded on simulated (analytical) behavior. Building classification of the HAZUS loss assessment software is adopted and both HAZUS-compatible and conventional fragility relationships are derived for two different soil conditions. Comparisons with HAZUS fragility curves are given. The parameters of the improved fragility relationships are provided for reliable use in loss assessment software.

21382,"Simulated tsunami and earthquake impact on RC structures: A comparative study The aim of this work is to undertake a comparison of vulnerability of a reinforced concrete building located on the Moroccan coast under a tsunami and a seismic load. Tsunami and seismic loads are evaluated through FEMA P646 and the Morocco seismic building code RPS2011 respectively. Thus, a case study building is analyzed by determining its reaction and displacements due to solicitations of each hazard separately. In order to determine the capacity of the building to each hazard, two methodologies are applied: time-history analysis and pushover. Next, fragility curves are plotted according to four damage states as a function of the inundation depth for tsunamis and of spectral displacement for earthquakes. A comparison is finally held between statistical data of past tsunami events and the reported impact data. In addition, a comparison between the impacts of these two hazards allows determining the associated threat limits and drawing recommendations so that buildings can resist tsunamis and earthquakes effects. © 2020 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.

17443,"Estimation of failure probabilities of RC frame structures in Singapore to the simulated largest credible ground motion Singapore is located about 400 km from the Sumatran fault and about 500 km from the Sumatran subduction zone in Indonesia. Although earthquake ground shaking has been felt occasionally, no damage to structures in Singapore has been directly attributed to Sumatran earthquakes. As such, building structures in Singapore are not designed to resist lateral earthquake loads, asides from a nominal lateral loading of 1.5% of the building weight as specified in BS8110 (British Standard Institution. BS8110: Structural use of concrete. Parts 1, 2, and 3; 1985). After the 1985 Mexico earthquake, the safety of the structures on soft soil sites in Singapore becomes a concern and lots of research effort has been spent on it. In this paper, the responses of three typical reinforced concrete (RC) structural models to a simulated earthquake event is assessed with consideration given to the statistical variation of the concrete and steel modulus and strength and dimensions of the structural members. A worst-case scenario simulated ground motion for Singapore soil sites is used for this analysis. The performance of the structures is assessed based on the resultant values of inter-storey drift. Probability and fuzzy set theory is used to estimate structural failure probabilities and to ad dress the ambiguity of the boundaries of the performance levels. Numerical results indicate that a typical RC low-rise structure is unlikely to be damaged, however medium-rise and high-rise structures are likely to be moderately damaged.

18089,"Fragility relationships for torsionally-imbalanced buildings using three-dimensional damage characterization In this paper, a methodology for the derivation of fragility relationships for three-dimensional (3D) structures with plan irregularities is developed. To illustrate the procedure, fragility curves are derived for an irregular reinforced concrete (RC) building under bi-directional earthquake loadings. In order to represent the damage state of irregular structures, a spatial (3D) damage index is employed as the salient response parameter. The feasibility of using a lognormal distribution for the bounded response variables, as in the case of structural fragility analysis, is investigated. Through the comparison between the fragility curves derived using the spatial and the previously-existing damage indices, it is shown that the proposed method provides realistic results and is therefore recommended for fragility analysis of buildings with significant torsional and bi-directional responses. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

13388,"Seismic fragility of lightly reinforced concrete frames with masonry infills Seismic fragility of lightly reinforced concrete frames with masonry infills is assessed through numerical simulations considering uncertainty in ground motion and building materials. To achieve this aim, a numerical model of the components is developed, a rational approach to proportion and locate individual struts in the equivalent three-strut model is proposed, and an explicit nonlinear column shear response model accounting for the infill-column interaction and soft-story mechanism is employed. The proposed numerical model is used to (1) generate probabilistic seismic demand models accounting for a wide range of ground motion intensities with different frequency content and (2) determine limit state models obtained from nonlinear pushover analysis and incremental dynamic analysis. Using the demand and limit state model, fragility curves for the masonry-infilled frames are developed to investigate the impact of various infill properties on the frame vulnerability. It is observed that the beneficial effect of the masonry infill diminishes at more severe limit states because of the interaction with the boundary frame. In some cases, this effect almost vanishes or switches to an adverse effect beyond a threshold of ground motion intensities. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

16941,"Development of seismic vulnerability curves for masonry buildings using the applied element method As an approach to the problem of the seismic vulnerability evaluation of existing buildings using the predicted vulnerability method, analytical procedures are applied to produce vulnerability curves for different building classes. For some building types, mainly masonry structures, the development of those curves will be complicated and time consuming if a Finite Element-based method is used. Therefore, the Applied Element Method is used here to develop fragility curves for those challenging building classes. The incremental dynamic analysis of a 6-storey industrial masonry building built in 1906 in Montreal, Canada has been carried out using 14 sets of synthetic and real ground motions representing three M, R categories. Intensity and damage measures are pointed on the IDA curves at three structural performance levels, immediate occupancy, life safety, and collapse prevention, for each ground motion. The statistical analysis of those points is then carried out to develop fragility curves for the masonry building at each performance level. To show the effect of the building typology, those fragility curves are compared with the fragility curve provided by NIBS in HAZUS-MH MR1 Technical and User's Manual for masonry buildings. © 2009 ASCE.

21027,"Seismic Risk Assessment of Nonengineered Residential Buildings: State of the Practice The poor socioeconomic conditions in developing countries often lead to poorly constructed residential buildings that are particularly vulnerable to damage during an earthquake. A review of available literature carried out as part of a larger research program highlights the scarcity of existing fragility curves for the wide typology of nonengineered residential buildings around the world. Furthermore, fragility curves derived using empirical data are almost nonexistent due to the lack of postearthquake damage data and insufficient ground motion recordings in developing countries. The diversity in construction techniques and material quality in developing countries, particularly for nonengineered residential buildings, cannot be sufficiently represented through simplified or idealized analytical models. Therefore, the use of empirical based fragility curves is considered to be a well-suited approach for assessing the seismic risk levels for nonengineered residential buildings in developing countries. This paper presents a review and evaluation of existing seismic risk assessment studies and state-of-the-practice as it pertains to nonengineered buildings, and subsequently proposes the use of attenuation-based USGS ground motion and shaking intensity maps and geographic information system damage information to derive relevant fragility curves. The USGS ground motion and shaking intensity maps are proposed as they are developed using a consistent robust methodology. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

12942,"Flood damage curves: new insights from the 2010 flood in Veneto, Italy Flood damage modelling is becoming an essential component in flood risk management. However damage assessments are affected by large uncertainty, mainly related to the use of depth–damage functions. In some countries, where no site-specific curves are available, a transfer of damage models developed from other areas is required, adding extra uncertainty in the modelling process. This paper discusses the transferability in space of damage curves from literature, with a focus on ‘function uncertainty’, pointing out, especially for mesoscale ones, the lack of detailed information in terms of flood and/or building characteristics that can allow to identify the conditions of applicability of the models. New site-specific depth–damage functions are then developed for the residential sector, at meso- and microscale, based on damage data from the 2010 flood in Veneto, Italy. The application of the new curves reveals a better performance of the mesoscale model compared with the more detailed microscale one, probably due to the small extent of the inundated area. © 2015 The Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management (CIWEM) and John Wiley & Sons Ltd depth–damage curves  flood damage assessment  Italy  mesoscale analysis  microscale analysis  uncertainty  validation  vulnerability flood control  flood damage  literature review  mesoscale eddy  performance assessment  residential location  risk assessment  uncertainty analysis  vulnerability  Italy  Veneto","Flood damage curves: new insights from the 2010 flood in Veneto, Italy",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,Empirical
16080,"Capacity, fragility and damage in reinforced concrete buildings: A probabilistic approach The main goals of this article are to analyze the use of simplified deterministic nonlinear static procedures for assessing the seismic response of buildings and to evaluate the influence that the uncertainties in the mechanical properties of the materials and in the features of the seismic actions have in the uncertainties of the structural response. A reinforced concrete building is used as a guiding case study. In the calculation of the expected spectral displacement, deterministic nonlinear static methods are simple and straightforward. For not severe earthquakes these approaches lead to somewhat conservative but adequate results when compared to more sophisticated procedures involving nonlinear dynamic analyses. Concerning the probabilistic assessment, the strength properties of the materials, concrete and steel, and the seismic action are considered as random variables. The Monte Carlo method is then used to analyze the structural response of the building. The obtained results show that significant uncertainties are expected; uncertainties in the structural response increase with the severity of the seismic actions. The major influence in the randomness of the structural response comes from the randomness of the seismic action. A useful example for selected earthquake scenarios is used to illustrate the applicability of the probabilistic approach for assessing expected damage and risk. An important conclusion of this work is the need of broaching the fragility of the buildings and expected damage assessment issues from a probabilistic perspective. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

The specific interpretation of damage data allowed carrying out fragility curves for slight, moderate, and heavy damage, (i.e., DS1, DS2, and DS3), defined according to EMS 98 macroseismic scale. Observational fragility curves are then employed for the calibration of FAST analytical methodology. FAST method is a spectral based approach, meant for the estimate of fragility curves of infilled RC buildings up to DS3, evaluated, again, according to EMS98. Kullback–Leibler divergence is employed to check the matching between analytical and observational fragilities. FAST input variables can vary in quite large ranges and the calibration provides a valuable suggestion for the application of the method in other cases in which field damage data are not available. Results showed that optimizing values, for the input variables calibrated, are in good agreement with typical values assumed in literature.

19655,"Preliminary Assessment on Seismic Vulnerability of Masonry Churches in Central Chile The 2010 Maule Chile earthquake (Mw 8.8) caused extensive structural damage to the built heritage. In particular, the poor seismic performance of a set of unreinforced masonry (URM) churches highlighted the need to implement protective and safety strategies in order to preserve these buildings which exhibit unique constructive and typological features, as a result of a combination of Chilean and European construction cultures. The peculiarity of this heritage and the high seismic hazard of Chilean territory have motivated the present study which aims to apply systematic procedures to assess the seismic vulnerability of these buildings. This article is of archival nature and presents a complete database generated from the geometrical, constructive, and structural characteristics of a representative stock of 106 churches located in central Chile, with the goal of proposing fragility curves to be used in seismic risk assessment. Considering variables related with geometrical, architectonic, and stylistic features, as well as damage levels for the 2010 Maule earthquake, this church sample is classified into three homogenous groups: colonial, neo-classic, and neo-gothic.

21297,"Sensitivity study for regional seismic assessment of L-shaped concrete moment resisting frame structures This paper describes a sensitivity study of the potentially significant parameters which influence seismic response of L-shape concrete moment resisting frame (LCMF) structures in Memphis, TN located in the Central United States. The sensitivity study is necessary to efficiently perform regional seismic assessments of LCMF structures using fragility curves which are conditional cumulative distribution functions that define the exceedance probability of a damage state for a given ground motion intensity level. For the sensitivity study, the main predictors for assessment of the seismic structural response of LCMF structures must be defined. Predictor variables of potential significance include both macro- and micro-parameters. The macro-parameters consist of geometric parameters (e.g., number of stories, eccentricity) and building design provisions (based on building construction date), while the micro-parameters include structural parameters (e.g., damping) and material properties (e.g., concrete compressive strength). This will be accomplished using a combination of Design of Experiments (DOE) and statistical tools.

16270,"Comparison of building damage scales and damage descriptions for use in earthquake loss modelling in Europe A review of damage scales for buildings is carried out with a view to assessing their suitability for use in earthquake loss modelling in Europe. A new ranking system is proposed to 'score' each scale. The ranking considers damage descriptions, building response factors, repair, cost of damage and ease of use, which are identified as the key characteristics required of damage scales used in loss modelling. The 'hybrid' RISK-UE damage scale (which uses a HAZUS-based approach) is seen to score high in the ranking, whilst 'hybrid' scales based on the EMS-98 damage scales perform poorly. However, it is found that none of the considered damage scales adequately satisfy all the criteria necessary for their use in European seismic loss estimation, especially with respect to inclusion of likely repair methods and damage costs. The development of cross-country loss models often involves using vulnerability curves or post-earthquake survey data that are commonly expressed in terms of different damage scales.

13112,"Minimal Building Fragility Portfolio for Damage Assessment of Communities Subjected to Tornadoes Tornadoes are considered a low-probability high-consequence event that can cause significant damage to community infrastructure, resulting in injuries and fatalities and ultimately creating long-term socioeconomic losses. Community resilience requires not only that the performance level of individual facilities be modeled and understood, but also their synthesis in space and time. Fragilities are conditional statistical distributions that provide the probability of exceeding analyst-defined performance levels as a function of hazard (or loading) intensity. Fragilities are becoming a core component in community resilience studies and enable the analyst to model performance of individual components or a cluster of the infrastructure, thereby supporting risk-informed decision making at the community level. In this paper, tornado fragilities for a portfolio of nonresidential buildings are developed. These fragilities, combined with several existing tornado building fragilities from the literature, are proposed to represent a first comprehensive minimum size portfolio of tornado building fragilities needed to model a community. For illustration, they are then used in the Centerville virtual community to perform community-level building damage assessment. This minimal-level portfolio of building fragilities lays the foundation for post-tornado recovery and resilience studies of a community, which eventually requires inclusion of all physical and nonphysical infrastructure. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

20457,"Seismic Damage Evaluation of Gravity Load Designed Low Rise RC Building Using Non-linear Static Method In India, the 2001 Bhuj earthquake has given a serious warning to many existing reinforced concrete (RC) buildings. However, a considerable portion of the building stock of India is reinforced concrete buildings which are generally designed mainly for gravity loads only. Therefore, potential seismic evaluation of these buildings, especially in high seismic region, is very essential in order to implement any kind of seismic hazard mitigation strategy. Hence, the present study aims to evaluate the seismic vulnerability of low rise RC frame building which is designed for gravity load according to the Indian code. The non-linear static analysis is performed using SAP2000 (v16) to find the capacity curve of the building. Fragility analysis is used to develop the fragility curve for different damage grade based on HAZUS methodology. Damage probability matrices (DPM) are formed for two different seismic hazard levels i.e. for maximum considered earthquake and design basis earthquake depending on the performance point to compare the damage state for each hazard level. The result shows that the damage of considered building is vary from moderate to severe damage state to the corresponding different seismic hazard level. © 2016 The Authors. capacity curve  fragility curve  lumped plasticity  pushover Buildings  Concrete buildings  Concretes  Geophysics  Hazards  Reinforced concrete  Seismic design  Seismic response  Seismology  Static analysis  Structural analysis  Capacity curves  Damage probability matrices  Existing reinforced concrete  Fragility curves  Maximum considered earthquakes  Non-linear static analysis  pushover  Seismic damage evaluation  Earthquakes",Seismic Damage Evaluation of Gravity Load Designed Low Rise RC Building Using Non-linear Static Method,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2580303652845946,0.07061305530774761,0.06403563358211839,0.005322900540060276,Analytical
12599,"Analytical tsunami fragility curves for seaport RC buildings and steel light frame warehouses Harbours are crucial assets for the sustainment and development of human activities. The recent devastating tsunami events as well as the increasing number of people, structures and economic activities being exposed to tsunami hazards revealed the need for the estimation of the effects of tsunami wave on seaport structures. However, only a limited number of tools to estimate the potential impacts of tsunami are available until now. This study aims at developing analytical tsunami fragility functions for some representative typologies of seaport structures in Greece. In particular, low-code moment resisting frame (MRF) and dual reinforced concrete (RC) buildings of various heights, and a typical warehouse are considered in the analysis. A numerical investigation is performed considering different combinations of tsunami loads based on FEMA P646 (2008) [1] recommendations for gradually increasing tsunami inundation depths and for the various structure typologies. To minimize the uncertainties related to the definition of damage limit states, tsunami nonlinear static analyses are performed and appropriate tsunami capacity curves are derived for the considered structures. Structural limit states are defined on tsunami capacity curves in terms of threshold values of material strain. For the complete damage state, shear failure is also considered, since the collapse of structures may be caused by the occurrence of either a flexural or shear failure in structural components. Fragility curves are numerically calculated for the different damage states using nonlinear regression analysis.

18784,"Macroseismic and mechanical models for the vulnerability and damage assessment of current buildings The European Commission funded the RISK-UE project in 1999 with the aim of providing an advanced approach to earthquake risk scenarios for European towns and regions. In the framework of Risk-UE project, two methods were proposed, originally derived and calibrated by the authors, for the vulnerability assessment of current buildings and for the evaluation of earthquake risk scenarios: a macroseismic model, to be used with macroseismic intensity hazard maps, and a mechanical based model, to be applied when the hazard is provided in terms of peak ground accelerations and spectral values. The vulnerability of the buildings is defined by vulnerability curves, within the macroseismic method, and in terms of capacity curves, within the mechanical method. In this paper, the development of both vulnerability and capacity curves is presented with reference to an assumed typological classification system; moreover, their cross-validation is presented. The parameters of the two methods and the steps for their operative implementation are provided in the paper. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.

21845,"The role of intensity measures on the accuracy of seismic fragilities Seismic fragilities are the probability that structural response of a system overcomes specified limit values for given seismic intensity measures. These curves are frequently defined as functions of single/multiple ordinates of the pseudo-acceleration response spectrum. Recently it was reported that this approach can lead to inaccurate estimation of the structural performance for complex non-linear multi-degree of freedom systems. This preliminary paper investigates the accuracy of fragility curves for an actual building struck by the 2016 Italian earthquake. Numerical analyses of a multi-degree of freedom structural system subjected to this earthquake are performed, considering both linear and non-linear behaviour, and used to construct scatter plots of intensity measures versus the corresponding actual maximum of the response time history. Finally, an example of the fragility curves estimated using different intensity measures is presented for both linear and nonlinear structural behaviour. It is shown that these fragilities have very large variability depending on the selected scalar or vector-valued intensity measure. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Complex mdof structural systems  Earthquake engineering  Epsilon(ε)  Fragility curves  Nonlinear response  Seismic intensity measures (IMs) Degrees of freedom (mechanics)  Earthquakes  Gears  Structural analysis  Ultrasonic devices  Acceleration response spectrums  Fragility curves  Multi degree of freedom systems  Multi degree-of-freedom  Non-linear response  Non-linear structural behaviours  Seismic intensity measures  Structural systems  Earthquake engineering",The role of intensity measures on the accuracy of seismic fragilities,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.365512153584876,0.02596811414889246,0.02540286842608081,0.07753414810289612,Analytical
13533,"The ex-ante evaluation of flood damages for a sustainable risk management The present paper presents an integrated model for the ex-ante evaluation of flood damages based on “stage damages curve” as a decision support tool for public and private authorities in the sustainable management of risk areas. The proposed model aims to estimate the damage both at a micro-scale and on an extended area. In particular, the dynamics of flooding in flood areas and their effects on the degree of vulnerability of the different types of buildings are considered. The proposed model, already experimented in different territorial contexts, has been applied to the case of the Senigallia flood, which took place in 2014. The first results show that the approach based on damage curves applied to different types of exposed goods at a micro-scale can reliably estimate the damages to buildings. In contrast, the ex-ante estimation of indirect damages is still uncertain due to the difficulty of evaluating, according to reliable criteria, unique assets such as intangibles and cultural and environmental assets. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.

Considering the variation law of nonlinear mechanical characteristics of un-carbonated concrete within service life, the seismic fragility curve of frames was developed based on the inter-storey drift corner in the weak storey of frame structures. According to the defined frame damage states, each seismic fragility curve reflects the probability change tendency of the defined damage state in frames within service life.

16156,"Classification Protocol and Comprehensive Database of Vertically Correlated Longitudinal Wind Velocities for Structural Analysis and Risk Assessment This manuscript presents a streamlined protocol to generate and classify synthetic random wind samples. The manuscript is accompanied with a comprehensive and publicly accessible repository of spatially and temporally correlated wind velocity samples for use in probabilistic structural analysis and design. The samples are classified based on the maximum sustained wind speed (maximum 1-min average), and the 3-s gust wind speed (maximum 3-s average), which are the intensity measures commonly used for structural analysis and fragility development. A comparative analysis showed the difference between the direct application of the intensity measure definition (by moving average) and the popular conversion factors used in practice. A classification based on the moving average analysis was found to result in portfolios of samples in each category that better capture the probabilistic characteristics of wind. To demonstrate the use and the importance of the constructed wind repository, a case study of fragility curves analysis of an elevated water tank steel lattice tower is presented.

15261,"A Novel Contribution for Resilient Buildings. Theoretical Fragility Curves: Interaction between Energy and Structural Behavior for Reinforced Concrete Buildings The paper introduces a new semi-probabilistic methodology for the definition of energy fragility curves suitable for a macro-classification of building stock inspired to and coupled with the widely adopted method of seismic fragility curves. The approach is applied to the reinforced concrete residential buildings of the Italian stock. Starting from a classification according to the climatic zone and the construction period, some reference buildings in terms of building envelope typologies have been defined and simulated by means of dynamic modeling tools. Then, cumulative distributions of the probability that the primary energy consumption for heating was comparable with certain threshold values are defined according to the climatic conditions expressed with the heating degree days, which constitute the intensity measure for the fragility curves. Finally, by focusing on the interaction points between structural and energetic aspects, it is shown how these curves can be useful for decision-makers with regards to definition of importance and or the level of intervention to be made to the building envelope for improving its seismic safety and the energy quality. Indeed, non-integrated interventions are more expensive and less efficient. reinforced concrete buildings  residential building stock seismic performance  energy performance  energy simulation SEISMIC VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT  HYBRID METHOD  2009 LAQUILA  DAMAGE DATA  PERFORMANCE  DESIGN",A Novel Contribution for Resilient Buildings.

16127,"Chapter 6 - Improving the Nepalese Building Code Based on Lessons Learned From the 2015 M7.8 Gorkha Earthquake The evaluation of the damage and impact after disastrous events offers a unique learning opportunity to improve existing earthquake risk reduction measures or implement new strategies. Damage observations and building surveys after the 2015 M7.8 Gorkha earthquake revealed structural deficiencies in low-rise reinforced concrete (RC) buildings with masonry infills, which are the prevalent building type in urban areas in Nepal. In particular, statistical analyses from damage data of more than 100 RC buildings have indicated a strong correlation between a wall index (WI) and damage level, which is a structural feature not currently controlled by the Nepal Building Code. This correlation was analytically verified through nonlinear dynamic analyses considering four typical Nepalese RC buildings with increasing WI levels. These analytical results were combined with a seismic hazard model for Nepal to calculate the distribution of the average annual collapse probability across the country. The findings of the study were used to provide recommendations concerning the minimum WI that could be incorporated by the building code. shear failure  earthquake risk estimation  fragility functions  nonductile seismic response  pushover analysis  RC frames with masonry infills  wall index None",Chapter 6 - Improving the Nepalese Building Code Based on Lessons Learned From the 2015 M7.8 Gorkha Earthquake,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3010880695967915,0.14166513262614222,0.029677099285969774,0.006382175033719504,Analytical
12692,"Comparative analysis of the fragility curves for Italian residential masonry and RC buildings The Department of Civil Protection (DPC), in compliance with the EU decision 1313/2013 and at the request of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030 to update the disaster risk assessments by various countries, released the latest National Risk Assessment for Italy at the end of 2018. Specifically, as regards the seismic risk assessment, six research units belonging to two centres of competence of the DPC collaborated under its guidance to update the risk maps of the Italian residential heritage. This extensive collaboration complied with the recent Italian code for Civil Protection, which requires a broad scientific consensus for risk assessment. During this research activity, six fragility models were developed, according to some common criteria (four for masonry buildings and two for RC buildings). These models were then implemented by the DPC for the definition of the national seismic risk. Within this context, the aim of this paper is to evaluate the risk results provided by these models, compare their features, and assess and validate their prediction capabilities. In particular, this paper shows the comparison of predicted and observed damage scenarios and consequences on building stock and the population of two seismic events, i.e. L’Aquila 2009 and Amatrice 2016. Furthermore, the paper provides some interesting damage and risk predictions at a national level.

20440,"Seismic damage characteristics and fragility of suspended ceilings in chinese public buildings [我国公共建筑中吊顶的震害特征及其易损性分析] The suspended ceilings in buildings are vulnerable to the falling of components such as ceiling tiles and light fixtures in earthquakes. These may lead to economic loss and hamper the quick recovery of the occupancy of buildings after earthquake. Based on the field investigation data on suspended ceilings due to Lushan earthquake of M7.0 in 2013, the seismic damage characteristics of the suspended ceilings in public buildings in China is investigated. The seismic fragility curves are established for suspended ceiling in China in terms of the tile falling ratio and peak floor acceleration under the 'quick recover' and 'hard to recover' damage states, and compared with the existing fragility curves in the literature for ceilings in the US. The results suggest that the suspended ceilings in China are more vulnerable than that in the US counterparts and the components near the corners and edges are easier to be damaged.

FEMA P-58 provides engineers a practical tool for the performance seismic assessment of buildings. In this article, FEMA P-58 is applied to a typical Italian pre-1970 reinforced concrete frame building, characterized by plain rebars as steel reinforcement and masonry infills and partitions. Given that suitable tools for these buildings are missing in FEMA P-58, in the first part of the article, specific fragility curves and loss functions for the main structural and non-structural components of the building type under consideration are proposed. In the second part, building performance is evaluated following a time-based assessment approach. Expected economic losses in form of repair costs are then derived.

20693,"Seismic Fragility Evaluation of Multi-Branch Piping Systems installed in Critical Low-Rise Buildings The failure of nonstructural components such as piping, ceiling, mechanical and electrical equipments led to operational and functional problems in structural system during the past severe earthquakes. Consequently, in the last few decades, a reduction of the damage to nonstructural components or an improvement on the performance of nonstructural component has emerged as a key area of research. The primary objective of this research was to develop the seismic fragility of the piping system incorporating the multi T-joint branch piping systems. The procedure for evaluating fragility curves corresponding to the first damage limit state considered the effects of each floor acceleration-sensitivity for low-rise RC and steel frame building structures subjected to 50 selected ground motions as function of uncertainties. The result of this study revealed that the conditional probability of failure to the piping system on each floor level in critical facilities increased with increased level of floor and in fact, floor level in low-rise buildings can tune the fragilities between the building and the piping system.

15563,"An overview of flood actions on buildings This paper presents an overview of flood characteristics with respect to their applicability for estimating and analysing direct flood damage to buildings. The approach taken is to define ""flood actions"" as acts which a flood could directly do to a building, potentially causing damage or failure. This definition expands the traditional approach of analysing flood damage to buildings which often focuses on damage from slow-rise flood depth. Flood actions may be energy transfers, forces, pressures, or the consequences of water or contaminant contact. This paper defines and categorises flood actions on buildings, indicating methods of quantification. The actions are classified in the following categories with respect to relative importance for flood damage assessment. • High relevance and relatively predictable: Lateral pressure from water depth differential between the inside and outside of a building, lateral pressure from water velocity, and water contact due to slow-rise depth. • Relevance varies and relatively predictable: Buoyancy. • Relevance varies and difficult predictability: Capillary rise, erosion, debris, turbulence, waves, other velocity actions, other chemical actions, nuclear actions, and biological actions. Due to the highly localised effects of some of the flood actions in the third category, coupled with their potentially significant impact, prediction of their impact on overall flood damage may be challenging. Awareness of their existence assists in developing an understanding of the uncertainties in flood damage estimation and analysis and in indicating areas which new research should tackle. In particular, work is needed in order to fully understand the physical processes by which flood damage arises and, hence, how flood damage may be prevented. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

20566,"Seismic Fragility Analysis of Multispan Reinforced Concrete Bridges Using Mainshock-Aftershock Sequences Although the knowledge and technology of performance-based earthquake engineering have rapidly advanced in the past several decades, current seismic design codes simply ignore the effect of aftershocks on the performance of structures. Thus, the present paper investigated the effect of aftershocks on seismic responses of multispan reinforced concrete (RC) bridges using the fragility-based numerical approach. For that purpose, a continuous girder RC bridge class containing 8 bridges was selected based on the statistical analysis of the existing RC bridges in China. 75 recorded mainshock-aftershock seismic sequences from 10 well-known earthquakes were selected in this study. In order to account for the uncertainty of modeling parameters, uniform design method was applied as the sampling method for generating the samples for fragility analysis. Fragility curves were then developed using nonlinear time-history analysis in terms of the peak curvature of pier column and displacement of bearings. Finally, the system fragility curves were derived by implementing Monte Carlo simulation on multinormal distribution of two components. From the results of this investigation, it was found that, for the RC continuous bridges, the influence of aftershocks can be harmful to both bridge components and system, which increases both the component fragility of the displacement of bearings and seismic curvature of pier sections and system fragility.

21422,"Sliding fragility of block-type non-structural components. Part 2: Restrained components This paper focuses on seismic vulnerability assessment of restrained block-type non-structural components under sliding response on the basis of seismic inputs specified by current seismic codes. The general representation of restrained equipment considered in this study consists of a rigid block restrained by four post-tensioned, symmetrically arranged cables. Two sliding-related failure modes are considered: restraint breakage and excessive absolute acceleration. Fragility analysis is proposed as an appropriate tool to evaluate these failure modes. Sample fragility curves developed through Monte-Carlo simulations show that the restraint breakage limit state is sensitive to the parameters of the equation of motion. For instance, fragility estimates obtained without taking into account vertical base accelerations can be significantly unconservative for relatively large values of the coefficient of friction. In contrast, the excessive absolute acceleration limit state exhibits little sensitivity to the parameters of the equation of motion. Peak absolute acceleration response is almost always equal to or greater than the horizontal peak base acceleration. Representative results suggests that reasonable response estimates for blocks located at stories other than the ground in multistorey buildings can in general be obtained by simply scaling the ground acceleration to the peak acceleration at the corresponding storey.

13376,"Seismic fragility curves using natural and synthetic ground motions Fragility curves are useful tools for the probabilistic assessment of the seismic performance of buildings. Nonlinear structural analyses with uncertainties in load and resistance are required to develop fragility curves. A statistically sufficient number of earthquake ground motion records should ideally be obtained from past records of the region of interest to have a satisfying fragility curve. However, the number of available earthquake records in many seismically active zones is limited. In such a situation, use of the synthetic ground motions is an accepted alternative for fragility analyses of buildings. This paper compares the seismic fragility curves obtained from synthetic and natural ground motion records. It is found that synthetic ground motions result in conservative fragility curves with lesser dispersion in drift demand when compared with natural recorded ground motions. © 2018 Ingenta.

21137,"Seismic Vulnerability Assessment of Existing Multi-Story Reinforced Concrete Buildings in Egypt Although seismic design codes are often subjected to improvements after each earthquake disaster, old constructions are left unprotected by new technology. The purpose of this paper is to promote public welfare and safety by reducing the risk of death or injury that may result from the effects of earthquakes on existing reinforced concrete (R/C) building stock in Egypt. It aims to evaluate seismic vulnerability of the most commonly used type of multi-story RC buildings. Special attention is placed upon examining R/C buildings with vertical irregularity. The seismic vulnerability assessment for existing R/C buildings is assessed through examining two types of damage indicators: damage index and inter-story drift limit state. A sample building set is selected to reflect existing construction practice including regular buildings and those with vertical irregularities. The effects of vertical irregularity at different floor levels are examined by developing fragility curves of medium-rise gravity load designed R/C buildings. Fragility curves of the investigated building set are determined by nonlinear time history analysis to evaluate the damage state. These curves are used to represent the probabilities that the structural damages, under various levels of seismic excitation, exceed specified damage states by means of earthquake intensity damage relations. The analytical damage evaluation in this study shows that the seismic effects of earthquakes experienced in Egypt may be significant. Moreover, it shows that some of the earthquakes may impose excessive displacement demands on the investigated buildings. The results also show that the irregular buildings are more vulnerable than the regular ones. © 2012 King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals.

12532,"A machine learning damage prediction model for the 2017 Puebla-Morelos, Mexico, earthquake The 2017 Puebla, Mexico, earthquake event led to significant damage in many buildings in Mexico City. In the months following the earthquake, civil engineering students conducted detailed building assessments throughout the city. They collected building damage information and structural characteristics for 340 buildings in the Mexico City urban area, with an emphasis on the Roma and Condesa neighborhoods where they assessed 237 buildings. These neighborhoods are of particular interest due to the availability of seismic records captured by nearby recording stations, and preexisting information from when the neighborhoods were affected by the 1985 Michoacán earthquake. This article presents a case study on developing a damage prediction model using machine learning. It details a framework suitable for working with future post-earthquake observation data. Four algorithms able to perform classification tasks were trialed. Random forest, the best performing algorithm, achieves more than 65% prediction accuracy.

The first part of the work analyses the seismic sequence to give an overview of the occurred events in terms of both ground motion parameters and macro-seismic intensities. The surveyed data are organized into a database made, to date, of 990 cases, which represent almost one-fourth of the whole surveys performed during the emergency phase. Such a significant statistical sample was used to carry out a regional scale typological analysis in order to identify the most recurrent typologies of churches present in Central Italy. The analysis of the observed damage and usability outcomes allowed drawing some conclusions on the behaviour of the inspected churches under the 2016–2017 seismic sequence.

18793,"Mainshock-consistent ground motion record selection for aftershock sequences In recent years, the additional risk posed to the built environment due to aftershock sequences and triggered events has been brought to attention, and several efforts have been directed towards developing fragility functions for structures in damaged conditions. Despite this rise of interest, a rather fundamental component for such tasks, namely that of aftershock ground motion record selection, has remained under-scrutinized. Herein, we propose a pragmatic procedure that can be applied for the selection of mainshock-aftershock ground motion pairs using consistent causal parameters and accounting for the correlation between their spectral accelerations. In addition, a structural analysis strategy that can be employed for the analytical derivation of damage-dependent fragility functions is outlined and presented through a case study. A more conventional back-to-back IDA analysis is also carried out in order to compare the derived damage-dependent fragility functions with the ones obtained with the proposed procedure. The results indicate that record selection remains a crucial factor even when assessing the structural vulnerability of damaged buildings, and should thus be treated cautiously. aftershock risk  damage accumulation  damage-dependent fragility functions  ground motion record selection  mainshock-aftershock sequences STEEL FRAME BUILDINGS  CONDITIONAL SPECTRUM  PERFORMANCE EVALUATION  FRAGILITY CURVES  SEISMIC RISK  INTENSITY  COMPONENTS  ALGORITHM  DEMAND  HAZARD",Mainshock-consistent ground motion record selection for aftershock sequences,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28708828428608696,0.014414798217060399,0.02653560649293431,0.03286000075284656,Analytical
19948,"Rapid seismic damage-state assessment of steel moment frames using machine learning The damage state assessment of buildings after an earthquake is an essential and urgent task that typically requires significant manpower and time for the resilience of a city-scale society. This study aims to develop machine learning (ML) models for the rapid seismic damage-state assessment of steel moment frames, which was never tried before to the authors’ knowledge. Eight ML models were examined for this purpose, including K-nearest neighbors, naïve Bayes, decision tree, random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting, and category boosting. The combination of 468 steel moment frames from the database in DesignSafe cyberinfrastructure and 240 ground motions yielded a total of 112,320 data points. The steel moment frames have a wide variety of geometric configurations (e.g., number of stories from 1 to 19, number of bays from 1 to 5, bay width from 6.1 to 12.19 m), and applied loads (i.e., three cases of dead load and two cases of live load). Nonlinear time history analyses were conducted using OpenSees to produce a comprehensive dataset for the training and testing of the ML models. A reliable procedure to define the damage states of steel moment frames was suggested based on pushover analysis. Damage states of steel moment frames were categorized following the tag definitions (i.e., green, yellow, and red) in ATC-20. Spectral accelerations at five selected periods (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 s) for the given ground motions and at the first three natural periods of the steel frames were used as input variables for the ML models. From the results, the RF model is suggested for the prediction of the seismic damage states of steel moment frames. The RF model could accurately predict 98% of the assigned tags in the testing dataset. In contrast, the AdaBoost (88%) and naïve Bayes (90%) models displayed the lowest performance. Among the four boosting methods considered, the XGBoost model (97%) exhibited the highest performance. Furthermore, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method was used to inspect the importance of input variables on the prediction. It was found that the spectral accelerations at 1 and 2 s strongly influence the prediction, likely because the first natural periods of the considered steel frames fall in the range of 1–2 s. Finally, to provide convenient access to engineers, a graphical user interface based on the developed RF model was created. This study places a pioneering step for the application of machine learning to the rapid damage assessment of building structures. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd Extreme gradient boosting  Machine learning  Random forest  Seismic damage states  Shapley additive explanations  Steel moment frames Additives  Damage detection  Decision trees  Forecasting  Machine learning  Nearest neighbor search  Seismology  Statistical tests  Structural frames  Damage state  Extreme gradient boosting  Gradient boosting  Machine learning models  Random forests  Seismic damage  Seismic damage state  Shapley  Shapley additive explanation  Steel moment frames  Adaptive boosting  earthquake damage  ground motion  machine learning  seismic response  software  steel  structural response",Rapid seismic damage-state assessment of steel moment frames using machine learning,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04090502552531572,0.007241682369529748,0.008592245593740569,0.6903487421182527,ML
22057,"Uncertainties in the quantification of flood damage potential Uncertainties in the quantification of flood damage potential The determination of flood damage potential in cost-benefit analyses is carried out in the individual federal states mostly with conventional use-oriented damage models. This type of damage functions provides expected values (average values) for the losses depending on the use and flood-specific impact parameters. The large scatter of reported losses is neglected. The paper considers the impact of vulnerability determining building parameter and different possible (use compliant) building stocks on these models. On the basis of Monte Carlo simulations, the scatter of the potential losses is calculated applying the vulnerability based, microscale EDAC-flood damage model for real flooding scenarios. The results illustrate that these uncertainties of the prognosis should be considered in the loss assessment and in particular for the scope of cost-benefit decisions. flood damage  losses  scatter  Monte Carlo simulation  damage scenarios MODELS",Uncertainties in the quantification of flood damage potential,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16616965385286842,0.09384047564833567,0.07080909324082414,0.048857776165487435,Analytical
17957,"Fragility and Vulnerability Analysis of an RC Building with the Application of Nonlinear Analysis In this paper, the seismic response of a five-story reinforced concrete (RC) frame system building is analysed through fragility analysis. The structure is designed in accordance with structural Eurocodes EN1990, EN1991, EN1992 and EN1998, as a high-ductility (DCH) system. For the analysis of the response of a structural system to earthquake actions, the methods of nonlinear static (NSA) and nonlinear dynamic analyses (NDA) are applied and, based on the obtained results, fragility curves are constructed using statistical methods. A relationship between the intensity measure (IM) and engineering demand parameters (EDPs) is needed in order to estimate a fragility curve. Fragility functions represent a possibility for different states of damage to occur in a certain structural systems at the observed value of the specified IM. Ten accelerograms, used in NDA, are selected and scaled, according to EN1998 provisions, for the chosen elastic response spectrum and referent PGA. Obtained results are used for the statistical analysis and construction of fragility curves. Structural damage state threshold parameters are determined based on the Park and Ang modified damage index methodology and provisions given in FEMA, HAZUS, VISION 2000 and EN codes. Comparative analysis of the structural damage probability for the analysed RC building, calculated using different methodologies to determine damage states, is applied. The fragility analysis results showed the difference between the probabilities of the damage states to occur when different calculation methods are used. This reflects on the assessment of vulnerability curves as well. The obtained results, calculated using different methods, are analysed using comparative analysis.

22260,"Vulnerability Curve Assessment of Low/Mid-Rise Buildings Subjected to Debris-Flow Hazards In this study, a methodology is developed to evaluate vulnerability (mean damage probability) curves of debris-flow for low/mid-rise buildings based on the fragility (exceedance damage probability) curves and mean damage ratio (MDR). In order to evaluate fragility curves, First Order Second Moment (FOSM) method is applied in this study. In the FOSM method, the maximum horizontal displacement of the building caused by the static and dynamic loadings of debris-flow is estimated as the effect of the external force, and the median/log-standard deviation values of spectral displacement of earthquake fragility of buildings developed by National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) are used as the resistance statistics. MDR of the building subjected to the load of debris-flow is established based on literatures of the post investigations of debris-flow and landslide disasters, and is applied to convert the fragility curve to vunerability curve. 32 different types of vulnerability curves for buildings are databased as the variables of log-normal cumulative distribution function (CDF) after calibration and correction with the available post-disaster data sets. The vulnerability curves developed in this study may be used for risk and loss assessment of buildings subjected to debris-flow hazards. The developed methodology can be also applied if information of the fragility is available and the vulnerability has to be estimated from the fragility. © 2021 Architectural Institute of Korea.

16291,"Comparison of numerical fragility curves for thin RC walls used in Lima, Peru considering variations of ground motion datasets In this study, an analytical approach was adopted to construct fragility curves for thin RC walls that are the vertical components of the lateral-force-resisting system of buildings to earthquakes typically used in Lima, Peru since 1998. The main feature of these walls is the use of electro-welded wire mesh as main reinforcement instead of conventional bars. The numerical models were constructed based on the results of experiments. A series of non-linear dynamic response analyses was performed using two ground motion datasets. The damage ratios were estimated with respect to four damage states performing seismic response analyses. The fragility curves were obtained assuming that the damage ratios follow lognormal distributions. Comparing the fragility curves obtained from the two datasets, the effects of ground motion characteristics to the responses of RC shear walls are discussed in this paper.

Determination of damaged buildings' structural performance exposed again to an earthquake is very important for a successful earthquake disaster and risk management. In this study, damage probabilities of damaged and non -damaged reinforced concrete buildings are evaluated. In this context, a moderately damaged middle-height reinforced concrete structure is selected.

21216,"Seismic vulnerability of air traffic control towers Airports are one of the critical infrastructures that play an essential role in managing natural disasters through receiving or sending aid and supplies. Air traffic control (ATC) towers are an inseparable part of each airport as the performance of airports depends on the functionality of their ATC towers. Many ATC towers have been designed and constructed based on older versions of modern seismic codes in which seismic design has followed a force-based design approach. This study addresses the seismic vulnerability of three in-service ATC towers which have been designed and constructed according to a force-based design concept. The height of the towers ranges from 24 to 52 m. Fragility curves have been used for the seismic vulnerability study of these towers. For the derivation of seismic fragility curves, 45 earthquake records were selected and classified into low, medium and high classes based on their ratio of peak ground acceleration (PGA) to peak ground velocity (PGV). It was observed that records with a low PGA/PGV ratio imposed the highest level of damage to the towers. However, when towers were subjected to the records with a high PGA/PGV ratio, the damage intensity was not significant. Results indicated that the intensity of seismic-induced damage to the tallest tower was significantly more than that of the shortest tower. It was concluded that only the shortest tower could satisfy the expected seismic performance objectives.

15738,"Assessment of an existing RC building before and after strengthening using nonlinear static procedure and incremental dynamic analysis Inadequate attention uring design and construction of some of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings in Cyprus has raised questions about the performance level of these existing buildings under future earthquakes. This study aimed to assess the seismic structural response of a four story existing RC building. For this purpose, first, the weak structural elements (e.g.\ the not safety column-beam joints and weak columns) were detected using linear static procedure (LSP) analyses on the basis of Turkish earthquake code. Then, two different strengthening methods were examined. In the first method which is common in Cyprus, the existing building was strengthened based on LSP, using column jacketing to satisfy seismic code requirements to remove the weak elements. The second strengthening method was carried out using nonlinear static procedures (NSP) to achieve the basic safety objective (BSO) performance level described in FEMA 356. For existing and both strengthened structures, pushover curves were obtained and following FEMA 356, performance points were calculated and compared. The seismic responses of existing and strengthened buildings were also assessed using incremental dynamic analyses (IDA). Nonlinear dynamic time history analyses have been performed by using SDOF models of these buildings under action of different scales of 20 ground motion records. Then IDA curves for each earthquake have been constructed. Limit - states at each performance level have been defined and summarizing the multi - record IDA curves, 16%, 50% and 84% fractile curves were obtained. Since selected structure represents common existing buildings in Cyprus, probabilistic structural damage estimation fragility curves were also obtained in terms of peak ground acceleration (PGA) for each considered performance level. Results showed that the strengthening method based on the NSP to satisfy the BSO requirements is much more effective than the one based on the LSP to improve the building performance and to reduce the probability of exceeding of limit states IO, LS and CP at any seismic zone. © 2010 - IOS Press and the authors.

17365,"Empirical tornado resilience model for light-framed wood residential buildings An empirical tornado resilience model based on structural functionality, a metric with clearly defined physical states, is developed for light-framed wood residential buildings using field observations of damage and recovery following the February 2017 tornado in Naplate, IL. The resilience model is composed of independent damage and recovery models that serve as a complete resilience model for residential buildings measured with the metric of structural functionality. Structural functionality is the most basic function of a building, the ability to safely provide shelter, and includes both the structural system and the building envelope. This model may be integrated into external resilience models that include measurements of other functionality components, such as lifeline services and building services, to construct a model of total functionality that includes all functionality components necessary for occupancy. The empirical tornado resilience model for light-framed wood residential buildings is an observation-based resilience model for residential buildings subject to tornado damage. It addresses the overlapping critical research needs for studies of tornado hazard, studies of residential resilience, and studies that provide a basis for validation, without replicating the existing body of resilience analysis frameworks. The included analysis using the indicators of structural functionality for wind-damaged structures reveals that some buildings trend toward zero functionality (demolition) during community-level recovery and that clear differences exist in the recovery behavior of buildings with similar post-storm structural functionality. Exponential structural functionality recovery functions are found to be appropriate for most levels of damage. Heavily damaged buildings are observed to follow a normal/s-shaped recovery.

IRMA allows data sharing, methods and models aimed to evaluate the seismic risk of Italian residential buildings, in order to comply with the requirements of the “Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030” (Sendai Framework). IRMA uses OpenQuake, a calculation engine developed as part of the Global Earthquake Model, to evaluate earthquake loss estimation. The user can create and upload different exposure/vulnerability databases as well as different sets of fragility curves on the platform. The hazard used in the platform is the MPS04 hazard model, developed by National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology that is actually the reference hazard map for the Italian code regulation. IRMA is extremely flexible: by combining the different exposure databases with all the possible sets of fragility curves, the user can produce maps of conditional damage (i.e. the return period is selected) or unconditional damage (i.e. an observation time window is selected). Damage scenarios can also be performed by using shakemaps of seismic events as input. The shakemaps, preloaded in the platform, are those referred to the recent seismic events in Italy.

19214,"Numerical modelling of coastal inundation from Cascadia Subduction Zone tsunamis and implications for coastal communities on western Vancouver Island, Canada In the present study, numerical simulations were conducted to estimate the spatio-temporal characteristics of tsunami inundation for municipalities on Vancouver Island, Canada, as a result of various potential Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake deterministic scenarios. By varying the earthquake magnitude and associated slip distance, the influence of these parameters on the tsunami wave propagation, inundation, and the possible damage on infrastructure and buildings was investigated. A numerical tsunami inundation model based on nonlinear shallow water equations was constructed using publically available bathymetric and topographic data and applied to three study areas: the City of Port Alberni, the District of Ucluelet, and the District of Tofino. The numerical results obtained in this study show that the maximum tsunami inundation depth and spatial extent of inundation are sensitive to the earthquake magnitude, whereas the tsunami arrival time is not. For the worst-case earthquake scenario investigated (MW 9.3), all of the three study areas were extensively inundated. Results of tsunami wave amplitude and overland inundation depth, flow velocity, hydrodynamic force, and depth–velocity product are analysed in detail to assess the impacts of the tsunami on inland buildings. The potential damage was estimated with previously proposed fragility curves for wood, reinforced concrete, and steel frame buildings. In conjunction with a site reconnaissance visit by the authors for better understanding the general characteristics of these areas, model results suggest that significant damage to buildings would occur, especially to wooden constructions, with considerable risk of loss of human life. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

15540,"An Integral Approach to Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis and Fragility Assessment for Reinforced Concrete Frame Buildings Fragility curves are useful tools for presenting the risk of structural damage from earthquakes as a function of a ground-motion parameter. Seismic hazard analysis for an area precedes the fragility analysis for structures built in that area. Many studies are available in the literature regarding probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) and fragility estimation. However, a practical approach to integrate the hazard curve from PSHA and using the ground motion of that level to estimate fragility can be an area to explore further. In this study, an effort has been made to obtain peak ground acceleration (PGA) level at design-based earthquake (DBE) from PSHA. Based on this PGA value obtained, a fragility assessment has been performed. This study aims to obtain a fragility curve for a midrise RC frame building for DBE hazard level using PSHA. Three 6-story RC frame buildings are considered in this study for a seismically active zone in India. The buildings have been designed with the following performance objectives: (1) immediate occupancy (IO) with 1% drift, (2) life safety (LS) with 2% drift, and (3) collapse prevention (CP) with 3% drift. Incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) is performed using 22 numbers of far-field ground motions as prescribed by a strong ground-motion database to obtain the capacity of exceeding the respective drift limit states. Fragility curves for the three buildings are generated based on those capacities.

20727,"Seismic fragility of RC structures under mainshockaftershock sequences recorded on soft soil conditions Past earthquake episodes of moderate-to-high magnitude have shown that strong mainshock trigger usually strong aftershocks forming, in such a way, the so-called mainshock-aftershock (MSAS) sequences. The latter can normally induce higher seismic losses to structures and infrastructures compared to the single mainshock event. High vulnerability has been also detected for structural systems being subjected to the soft soil earthquake strong ground motions due to the soft soils-driven amplification in structural demand. Along these lines, this study investigates the seismic fragility of an existing reinforced concrete (rc) structure subjected to MSAS sequences recorded on soft soil profiles. To this end, a preliminary selection of 28 and 52 soft-soil mainshocks and aftershocks strong GMs respectively served the basis to generate 36 artificial earthquake sequences. The latter were made of six mainshocks and six aftershocks seismic motions that are representative of the initially formed sets of records in terms of the predominant period, Tg, and the strong ground motion duration. An existing seven-story rc building located in Van Nuys, California, was modelled by using the OpenSees finite element code. The measured response of the building during the Northridge (1994) earthquake episode was used to validate the finite element model developed herein. Nonlinear time history analysis was performed and the soft-soil MSAS-induced structural response (i.e., roof drift, maximum interstory drift ratio and maximum residual interstory drift ratio) was comparatively assessed with the response induced by MSAS sequences recorded on firm soil conditions. Fragility analysis was also conducted and the relevant fragility curves were estimated accounting for varying intensity of the aftershocks. Based on the results derived herein, the firm-soil MSAS led to higher structural collapse capacity compared to the one that was calculated by using the soft-soil MSAS, the latter being more profound when the building was subjected to aftershocks with increased intensity. © 2019 The authors.

21466,"State-dependent vulnerability of case-study reinforced concrete frames This study investigates the effect of mainshock-aftershock sequences on numerical fragility and vulnerability relationships of European reinforced concrete (RC) moment-resisting frames (MRFs). A four-story, four-bay nonductile RC MRF is selected for illustrative purposes. This index building is representative of a typical vulnerability class in the Mediterranean region. The influence of the masonry infills on seismic performance is also investigated. An advanced numerical nonlinear model is developed for the case-study frame and then assessed through nonlinear dynamic analysis using both real and artificial mainshock-aftershock sequences, via a ‘sequential cloud’ approach. The obtained seismic demand estimates allow to generate fragility functions for the undamaged frame when subjected to mainshocks only. Moreover, state-dependent fragility functions are derived for the mainshock-damaged frame when subsequently subjected to aftershocks. Damage-to-loss models, specifically calibrated on Italian post-earthquake data, are used to derive vulnerability functions for this case-study structure. Preliminary results from the study show that the frame experiences severe damages states and high losses for a range of ground-motion shaking intensities, with a clear damage increase due to aftershocks. An attempt to generate vector-valued mainshock-aftershock vulnerability relationships is finally presented. The proposed vulnerability surfaces can be more easily implemented into a time-dependent risk assessment framework. © 2019 The authors.

15535,"An innovative micro-scale approach for vulnerability and flood risk assessment with the application to property-level protection adoptions Economic damage assessment for flood risk estimation is established in many countries, but attentions have been focused on macro- or meso-scale approaches and less on micro-scale approaches. Whilst the macro- or meso-scale approaches of flood damage assessment are suitable for regional- or national-oriented studies, micro-scale approaches are more suitable for cost–benefit analysis of engineered protection measures. Furthermore, there remains lack of systematic and automated approaches to estimate economic flood damage for multiple flood scenarios for the purpose of flood risk assessment. Studies on flood risk have also been driven by the assumption of stationary characteristic of flood hazard, hence the stationary-oriented vulnerability assessment. This study proposes a novel approach to assess vulnerability and flood risk and accounts for adaptability of the approach to nonstationary conditions of flood hazard. The approach is innovative in which an automated concurrent estimation of economic flood damage for a range of flood events on the basis of a micro-scale flood risk assessment is made possible. It accounts for the heterogeneous distribution of residential buildings of a community exposed to flood hazard. The feasibility of the methodology was tested using real historical flow records and spatial information of Teddington, London. Vulnerability curves and residual risk associated with a number of alternative extents of property-level protection adoptions are estimated by the application of the proposed methodology. It is found that the methodology has the capacity to provide valuable information on vulnerability and flood risk that can be integrated in a practical decision-making process for a reliable cost–benefit analysis of flood risk reduction options. © 2018, The Author(s).

The aim of this paper is to perform seismic damage evaluation for educational multi-storey reinforced Concrete Building in Al-Mustaqbal University College (MUC) in Al-Hilla City, Babylon governorate in the middle of Iraq by using FEMA P-58 methodology. A 3D mathematical modelling, pushover analysis by using SeismoStruct software. In addition, incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) and fragility curve according to FEMA P-58 are developed in order to obtain damage limits in term of performance levels of the case study building. Fragility curves are useful tools for showing the probability of structural damage due to earthquakes as a function of ground motion indices. IDA is performed for those simulated building using twelve ground motions with scaling peak ground acceleration increased every 0.1g until it achieved 1.5g to determine the drift capacity of the building in four performance levels, operational (OP), immediate occupancy (IO), life safety (LS) and near collapse (NC) as defined in FEMA P-58.

16349,"Constructing and validating geographically refined HAZUS-MH4 hurricane wind risk models: A machine learning approach Accurate estimation of risk to structures due to hurricane wind hazards is critical for emergency planning and post-event recovery. A widely used model for assessing risks due to hurricane winds at the county or zip code level is the HAZUS-MH4 suite of programs developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Very few studies have attempted to assess the predictive accuracy of HAZUS wind risk models at levels of geographical specificity below counties and zip codes. In this paper, we present a methodology for computing HAZUS predictions of wind damage aggregated to the level of one kilometer square blocks. We use detailed damage data on over 700,000 single-family residences in Harris County collected in September 2008 after Hurricane Ike for evaluating the predictive performance of HAZUS. We show that at this level of aggregation, HAZUS has a predictive accuracy of 29.5%. This finding raises the question of how to improve the predictive accuracy of HAZUS-MH4 models at this level of spatial specificity. It is difficult to manually analyze errors made by HAZUS over a data set with 700,000+ structures, so we devise a statistical machine learning approach to distinguish structures whose damage is correctly predicted by HAZUS from those that are incorrectly predicted. We identify ten potential explanatory variables at the level of each building. These variables include number of floors, terrain, age, whether a building was remodeled, building and land value, proximity to highway, and more refined wind measurements including wind speed, wind swath and wind direction. Our machine learning classifier reveals the relative importance of these variables for improving HAZUS's predictive performance. In particular, we find that HAZUS's fragility curves for one and two floor residences in urban terrains need to be refined by incorporating building and land value, age, proximity to a major highway, as well as wind direction and wind swath. These results can be used to build the next generation of HAZUS fragility curves for accurately predicting hurricane wind damage to structures at a spatial specificity of one kilometer square blocks.

17338,"Empirical fragility assessment of buildings affected by the 2011 Great East Japan tsunami using improved statistical models Tsunamis are destructive natural phenomena which cause extensive damage to the built environment, affecting the livelihoods and economy of the impacted nations. This has been demonstrated by the tragic events of the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, or the Great East Japan tsunami in 2011. Following such events, a few studies have attempted to assess the fragility of the existing building inventory by constructing empirical stochastic functions, which relate the damage to a measure of tsunami intensity. However, these studies typically fit a linear statistical model to the available damage data, which are aggregated in bins of similar levels of tsunami intensity. This procedure, however, cannot deal well with aggregated data, low and high damage probabilities, nor does it result in the most realistic representation of the tsunami-induced damage. Deviating from this trend, the present study adopts the more realistic generalised linear models which address the aforementioned disadvantages. The proposed models are fitted to the damage database, containing 178,448 buildings surveyed in the aftermath of the 2011 Japanese tsunami, provided by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure Transport and Tourism in Japan. In line with the results obtained in previous studies, the fragility curves show that wooden buildings (the dominant construction type in Japan) are the least resistant against tsunami loading. The diagnostics show that taking into account both the building's construction type and the tsunami flow depth is crucial to the quality of the damage estimation and that these two variables do not act independently. In addition, the diagnostics reveal that tsunami flow depth estimates low levels of damage reasonably well; however, it is not the most representative measure of intensity of the tsunami for high damage states (especially structural damage). Further research using disaggregated damage data and additional explanatory variables is required in order to obtain reliable model estimations of building damage probability. © 2014 The Author(s).

19285,"On the Influence of Input Data Quality to Flood Damage Estimation: The Performance of the INSYDE Model IN-depth SYnthetic Model for Flood Damage Estimation (INSYDE) is a model for the estimation of flood damage to residential buildings at the micro-scale. This study investigates the sensitivity of INSYDE to the accuracy of input data. Starting from the knowledge of input parameters at the scale of individual buildings for a case study, the level of detail of input data is progressively downgraded until the condition in which a representative value is defined for all inputs at the census block scale. The analysis reveals that two conditions are required to limit the errors in damage estimation: the representativeness of representatives values with respect to micro-scale values and the local knowledge of the footprint area of the buildings, being the latter the main extensive variable adopted by INSYDE. Such a result allows for extending the usability of the model at the meso-scale, also in different countries, depending on the availability of aggregated building data. flood damage assessment  INSYDE  micro-scale  meso-scale RISK",On the Influence of Input Data Quality to Flood Damage Estimation: The Performance of the INSYDE Model,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06584986037299163,0.06410185252623367,0.12187297117211614,0.0956811959135131,Hybrid
15506,"An empirical seismic vulnerability model This paper proposes a novel seismic vulnerability model for the classification of the existing residential building stock. The vulnerability model rests on a data-driven approach, taking advantage of observed seismic damages detected on several Italian building typologies, struck by the 2009 Lâ€™Aquila earthquake. Unsupervised machine learning techniques are exploited for clustering empirical damage data and objectively identifying vulnerability classes of decreasing vulnerability. The cascading use of different strategies, involving clustering analysis and probability theory, results in a comprehensive vulnerability model, which allows for determining, into a probabilistic framework, the degree of belonging of a given building typology to multiple vulnerability classes. The adoption of the peak ground acceleration for characterising the ground shaking is a further advantage of this study, overcoming several limitations related to the use of macroseismic intensity.

12607,"Application of Fragility Analysis to Timber-Framed Structures for Seismic and Robustness Assessments In the past few years, the construction of multi-storey timber buildings has increased significantly in locations where high-intensity ground motions are likely to occur. On the other hand, the fast development of wood engineered products, as glued-laminated timber (GLT) and cross-laminated timber (CLT), has been challenging researchers to provide adequate guidelines for the design and assessment of structures built in seismic regions. Some guidelines and analysis methods considered in seismic design can improve robustness, commonly described as the ability of structures to sustain limited damage without disproportionate effects. This paper proposes a probabilistic methodology for seismic and robustness assessment of timber-framed structures. The seismic performance and the progressive collapse potential of a three-storey building are here exemplified through the proposed methodology, which accounts for uncertainties in mechanical properties of members and connections, as well as for external loads. The Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) was used in each assessment to generate a set of 1000 structural models. Each structural model corresponds to a realization of the random variables used to define the structural model. Incremental dynamic analyses were performed to develop seismic fragility curves for different damage levels. The fragility functions for robustness assessment were developed for distinct damage scenarios, exploiting the results of an alternate load path analysis (ALPA) that involved the performance of nonlinear static analyses (pushdown analyses). The methodology presented is suitable for risk-based assessments that consider the occurrence of different exposures, such as earthquakes, impacts, and explosions, while considering the direct and indirect consequences of failures. However, the methodology involves time-consuming analyses with distinct load scenarios, which can constitute a burdening task within a typical building design phase. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

21272,"SELENA – An open-source tool for seismic risk and loss assessment using a logic tree computation procedure The era of earthquake risk and loss estimation basically began with the seminal paper on hazard by Allin Cornell in 1968. Following the 1971 San Fernando earthquake, the first studies placed strong emphasis on the prediction of human losses (number of casualties and injured used to estimate the needs in terms of health care and shelters in the immediate aftermath of a strong event). In contrast to these early risk modeling efforts, later studies have focused on the disruption of the serviceability of roads, telecommunications and other important lifeline systems. In the 1990s, the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS) developed a tool (HAZUS®99) for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), where the goal was to incorporate the best quantitative methodology in earthquake loss estimates. Herein, the current version of the open-source risk and loss estimation software SELENA v4.1 is presented. While using the spectral displacement-based approach (capacity spectrum method), this fully self-contained tool analytically computes the degree of damage on specific building typologies as well as the associated economic losses and number of casualties. The earthquake ground shaking estimates for SELENA v4.1 can be calculated or provided in three different ways: deterministic, probabilistic or based on near-real-time data. The main distinguishing feature of SELENA compared to other risk estimation software tools is that it is implemented in a ‘logic tree’ computation scheme which accounts for uncertainties of any input (e.g., scenario earthquake parameters, ground-motion prediction equations, soil models) or inventory data (e.g., building typology, capacity curves and fragility functions). The data used in the analysis is assigned with a decimal weighting factor defining the weight of the respective branch of the logic tree. The weighting of the input parameters accounts for the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties that will always follow the necessary parameterization of the different types of input data. Like previous SELENA versions, SELENA v4.1 is coded in MATLAB which allows for easy dissemination among the scientific-technical community. Furthermore, any user has access to the source code in order to adapt, improve or refine the tool according to his or her particular needs. The handling of SELENA’s current version and the provision of input data is customized for an academic environment but which can then support decision-makers of local, state and regional governmental agencies in estimating possible losses from future earthquakes.

Probabilistic fire risk assessments are useful in ensuring safety and consider the post-earthquake reliability of fire protection systems. This study therefore investigated damage to fire protection systems due to the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake through a questionnaire survey among hospitals to collect data available for modeling the post-earthquake reliability. Ten types of component of a fire protection system were surveyed: emergency generators, fire detectors, water tanks used for firefighting, fire pumps, sprinkler heads, indoor fire hydrant boxes, fixed glass smoke curtains, fire doors, fire shutters, and fire exit signs. The data show that there was much damage to fire detectors, sprinkler heads, fixed glass smoke curtains, and fire doors. Zero-inflated Poisson regression analysis was conducted to derive statistical damage models that describe the association of building response quantities with the number of instances of damage. Results of a case study using the models show that building shaking exceeding a peak response acceleration of 10 m/s2 may reduce the probability of successful functioning to below 40% for a sprinkler system and to below 90% for a smoke-activated door system. © 2022 The Author(s).

21097,"Seismic vulnerability assessment and fragility analysis of pre-code masonry buildings in Portugal Despite the fact that in recent years Portugal has not seen the occurrence of high-magnitude earthquakes, it remains threatened by these events due to its geographic location. Since the 1960s, reinforced concrete has been the most used material for new constructions; however, the historic urban centers are dominated by old unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings, which techniques and construction materials have evolved since the Great Lisbon earthquake that occurred in 1755 (Mw = 8.5). Given the presence of these buildings in areas of significant seismicity, extensive research is needed to assess the seismic risk and define mitigation policies. This kind of studies is often supported by empirical methods and based on expert judgment due to the high variability of the building stock and lack of information. The main purpose of this work is: (i) to provide analytical fragility curves, supported by nonlinear static analysis, for the entire population of old masonry buildings, built before the introduction of the first design code for building safety against earthquakes (RSSCS) in 1958; (ii) define vulnerability curves to be used by the technical community for seismic assessment of pre code URM buildings.

Starting from the determination of capacity curves from capacity spectrum-based method which revealed the nonlinear performances of buildings together with fragility curves, damage probability matrices (DPM) are formed for maximum considered earthquake (MCE) and design basis earthquake (DBE) to evaluate the damage state.

21247,"Seismic vulnerability of reinforced concrete constructions in northern Morocco The concept of earth quake vulnerability is used in this work to predict the average damage that buildings are likely to experience on a large scale with the occurrence of an earthquake of given intensity. The use of the vulnerability concept is considered in the context of the particular typology of reinforced concrete buildings, which are commonly encountered in northern Morocco and which have not been engineered with adequate earthquake protection. The vulnerability scale is adapted based on the Italian method called Gruppo Nazionale per la Difesa dai Terremoti (GNDT) by adjusting the weighting coefficients to better match the local architectural characteristics of these types of buildings. A correlation is then proposed between the damage index considered as the main tracked effect and the causes that are herein idealized through the vulnerability concept. The results of field observations performed after the strong earthquake in Al Hoceima of magnitude 6.3 that hit the region of northern Morocco in 2004 have shown that the proposed method can correctly evaluate vulnerability.

12691,"Comparative analyses of flood damage models in three Asian countries: towards a regional flood risk modelling The use of different approaches in the development of flood damage models in various countries is expected to affect flood damage modelling at a regional or global scale. Since these models are often used as tools for disaster management and decision making, it is very needful to understand the comparative similarity and differences in countries’ loss models; this can help in the overall integration for developing regional risk models and cross-country risk assessment. In this study, empirically generated generalised loss models in three Asian countries (Sri Lanka, Thailand and Japan) were compared and applied to estimate potential flood damages in two different urban river basins. For each case study, each model was normalised using cost prices and floor areas (as applied to each country) and were integrated within the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to estimate damages for the flood events. Using the mean vulnerability index of corresponding building types for the selected countries, a single model for regional flood risk assessment was created. However, the study showed that there are variations in the vulnerability and the potential flood damage estimates of similar global building types from the three countries, despite being developed by the same approach. These are attributed to the country’s specific conditions such as building regulations and codes, GDP per capita, cost price of building materials. Our results suggest that the average vulnerability index from the countries however reduced potential errors in the estimates. Moreover, it is proposed that the average regional vulnerability model derived with empirical data inputs from all the countries for regional risk assessment and cross-country comparison. Therefore, it can predict near accurate potential flood damages, which can serve as measures for regional flood disaster risk management plans. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

18373,"Implications of cumulated seismic damage on the seismic performance of unreinforced masonry buildings The seismic capacity of a structure is a function of the characteristics of the system as well as of its state, which is mainly affected by previous damage and deterioration. The cumulative damage from repeated shocks (for example during a seismic sequence or due to multiple events affecting an unrepaired building stock) affects the vulnerability of masonry buildings for subsequent events. This paper proposes an analytical methodology for the derivation of state-dependent fragility curves,taking into account cumulated seismic damage,whilst neglecting possible ageing effects. The methodology is based on nonlinear dynamic analyses of an equivalent single degree of freedom system,properly calibrated to reproduce the static and dynamic behaviour of the structure.

12874,"Empirical fragility curves of engineered steel and RC residential buildings after Mw 7.3 2017 Sarpol-e-zahab earthquake This study investigates the damage data after November 12, 2017, Iran earthquake (Mw 7.3), collected on 440 steel and reinforced concrete residential buildings. Structures have low-to-medium height and are located in Sarpol-e-zahab city, as well as in the west and northwest parts of Kermanshah province, Iran. The peak ground acceleration demands are determined according to data of the micro-shakemap of Sarpol-e-zahab city and the shakemap of Kermanshah province, while the mean values of intensities are determined from the existing empirical relationship between PGA and intensity. The investigated buildings are engineered steel and RC structures nominally erected according to the second and third editions of the Iranian code for earthquake-resistant buildings, but mostly under careless supervision and with low-quality materials. Damage probability matrix, vulnerability index and empirical fragility curves are presented for three subgroups of steel and RC structures on the basis of (i) structural materials and seismic resistant systems (i.e. braced, moment and combination of braced and moment steel frames, as well as moment and combination of moment and shear wall RC frames), without considering the height of structures; (ii) structural materials and height of structures, without considering the seismic resistant systems (i.e. low and medium-height steel and RC structures); (iii) structural materials, without considering the seismic resistant systems and height of structures (i.e. total data for steel and RC frames). The proposed fragility curves are compared with other fragility curves for steel and RC buildings from previous studies. Finally, since this earthquake was the first seismic event in Iran affecting a considerable number of steel and RC engineered buildings, the proposed empirical fragility curves are definitely unique and crucial for realistic damage and vulnerability assessment of similar buildings in future earthquake scenarios, as well as for developing rapid seismic loss assessment after damaging earthquakes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

18080,"Fragility models for existing masonry infilled RC frames in the Emilia area Fragility models are important tools for seismic risk assessment and seismic damage scenarios estimation. Some models are already available in the literature, however, in the case of infilled RC frames, further investigations are necessary, given the high uncertainty about their behaviour. In fact, damage observations following seismic events, suggest that the presence of masonry infills can strongly influence the response of reinforced concrete (RC) frames and affect their collapse mechanisms. The main goal of this work is to contribute to the seismic vulnerability assessment of the existing building stock in the Emilia-Romagna region in northern Italy, developing fragility models for infilled RC frame buildings. On the basis of an analysis of both census data on the existing building stock and on damage survey forms after the 2012 Earthquake, a set of representative structures was defined and modelled with finite elements, adopting a concentrated plasticity approach. Different modelling approaches of the infill walls were considered, using single and multi-strut models, in order to simulate shear failure in columns. Non-linear static (push-over) analyses were then carried out on these models to obtain their capacity curves. Displacement demands were computed using simplified procedures (IN2 method). The definition of damage levels in the models was based on the achievement of local deformation capacity limits of structural and non-structural elements, according to the classification provided by the EMS-98 Macro-seismic scale. Fragility curves were finally obtained by considering uncertainties in material properties, by means of the Response Surface method, as well as ground-motion record-to-record variability. © 2021 COMPDYN Proceedings.

19200,"Numerical investigation and empirical seismic vulnerability assessment of timber- framed masonry buildings This chapter describes the development of traditional timber-framed masonry techniques as an antiseismic measure in the course of time and their corresponding seismic effectiveness. Firstly, the evolution of timber framed structures from the Bronze Age to date is presented and the effects on their seismic resistance of the structural changes to which these structures have been subjected since the most ancient construction. It is noted that the appearance of timber in the body of masonry walls in prehistoric Greece after strong seismic events is the first time in the history of mankind that an effort is made to provide a rational method for seismic resistance to buildings. The seismic performance of traditional structures during recent earthquakes is also discussed. A variety of advanced analytical modelling strategies for these buildings is presented, from a detailed micro-model to macro-model procedures. The potential seismic vulnerability of these buildings is investigated using statistical data from recent earthquakes.

16367,"Contribution of seismic noise recordings to the nonstructural vulnerability assessment Since the 1990s, the recordings of ambient vibrations in structures have gained interest in the civil engineering community due to technological improvements of portable sensors, allowing the recordings of small amplitude vibrations, and the possibility of processing a large amount of data even in real time. Many applications, based on the analysis of seismic noise, exist in the literature for checking the serviceability limit state of existing construction in the case of earthquakes. These applications can be extended to the case of occurrence of induced and triggered seismicity and its potential impact on the built environment. The latter impact has heightened both public concern and regulatory scrutiny, emphasizing the need for an integrated risk management framework. Considering the case of induced seismicity, the vulnerability assessment requires the expected damage to refer to non-structural components. In this study, some historical masonry buildings located in Alsace France are considered and the dynamic characteristics of these structures were estimated by the analysis of seismic noise recordings by sensors installed at each floor of the buildings under study. The estimated dynamic properties for small amplitude vibrations of these historical structures were used to derive simplified vulnerability models. Moreover, the Eurocode 8 defines the interstory drift limit of a building for non-structural damage, by looking at its displacement-sensitive nonstructural components at the serviceability limit state. Therefore, by adopting these limits and the developed simplified vulnerability models, new fragility curves for typical historical masonry building types dominant in the region under study are proposed. The fragility curves have been calculated using incremental dynamic analysis for the seismic demands generally imposed upon linear and slightly non-linear models of single and multiple degrees of freedom, which is the case for the effects of induced seismicity. These results will prove useful for both local end-users and industrial stakeholders, with a clear perspective for a better understanding of the risk related to induced and triggered seismicity and its sound management. © 2020 European Association for Structural Dynamics.

18819,"Measurement Approach to Develop Flood-Based Damage Fragilities for Residential Buildings Following Repeat Inundation Events Floods account for the highest annual average losses from natural hazards across the United States, and the occurrence of repeat flood inundation events in United States communities is increasing. Distinguishing damages caused by distinct flood events in a community that has experienced repeated flooding is difficult, and best practices for repeat flood metrology are needed to better inform and validate flood damage models. This paper presents a longitudinal methodology for measuring impacts from repeated flood inundation through a case study of buildings in Lumberton, North Carolina, where major flood events occurred in 2016 and 2018. Sources of uncertainty encountered in flood damage assessments are presented to inform best practices for future investigations of repeat flood events. A novel initial state parameter is introduced for accurate damage characterization for a repeat flood event. This paper presents the first analysis of statistical distributions of damage conditioned on flood depth for a set of buildings that have been flooded in two consecutive events, and the results show how floods with similar intensities occurring in the same area at two different times can exhibit differing distributions. Flood damage data sets for the two floods are combined to derive flood damage fragilities, and we propose the creation of a flood damage database by aggregating data from various flood events across the United States to enable more robust fragility functions that can be applied across geographies and flood events. © 2022 This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license,.

12675,"Capacity, damage and fragility models for steel buildings: a probabilistic approach Recently proposed capacity-based damage indices and parametric models for capacity curves are applied to frame steel buildings located in soft soils of the Mexico City. To do that, the seismic performance of 2D models of low-, mid- and high-rise buildings is assessed. Deterministic and probabilistic nonlinear static and incremental dynamic analyses are implemented. Monte Carlo simulations and the Latin Hypercube sampling technique are used. Seismic actions are selected among accelerograms recorded in the study area. Spectral matching techniques are applied, so that the acceleration time histories have a predefined mean response spectrum and controlled error. The design spectrum of the Mexican seismic code for the zone is used as target spectrum. The well-known Park and Ang damage index allows calibrating the capacity-based damage index. Both damage indices take into account the contribution to damage of the stiffness degradation and of the energy dissipation. Damage states and fragility curves are also obtained and discussed in detail. The results reveal the versatility, robustness and reliability of the parametric model for capacity curves, which allow modelling the nonlinear part of the capacity curves by the cumulative integral of a cumulative lognormal function. However, these new capacity-based damage index and capacity models have been tested for and applied to 2D frame buildings only; they have not been applied to 3D building models yet. The Park and Ang and the capacity-based damage indices show that for the analysed buildings, the contribution to damage of the stiffness degradation is in the range 66-77% and that of energy loss is in the range 29-34%. The lowest contribution of energy dissipation (29%) is found for the low-rise, more rigid, building. The energy contribution would raise with the ductility of the building and with the duration of the strong ground motion. High-rise frame buildings in soft soils of Mexico City show the worst performance so that the use of adequate braced frames to control the displacements could be recommended.

20697,"Seismic fragility for a masonry‐infilled rc (Mirc) building subjected to liquefaction Historical earthquakes have documented that lateral spread and settlements are the most significant damages induced by soil liquefaction. Therefore, assessing its effects on structural performance has become a fundamental issue in seismic engineering. In this regard, the paper proposes to develop analytical fragility curves of a Masonry‐Infilled RC (MIRC) structure subjected to liquefaction‐induced damages. In order to reproduce the nonlinear cyclic behavior (dilation tendency and the increase in cyclic shear strength) due to liquefaction, nonlinear hysteretic materials and advanced plasticity models were applied. The findings herein obtained in terms of seismic fragility of the MIRC building subjected to liquefaction may be implemented as guidelines or code provisions. © 2021 by the author.

21248,"Seismic Vulnerability of Reinforced Concrete Structures in Tizi-Ouzou City (Algeria) Important urban centers have been shaken in the recent past in Algeria which is a very active seismic zone. Since El Asnam earthquake (1980), many tools, such as seismic codes for buildings, bridges and tunnels, have been developed and implemented for seismic risk reduction. So, seismic scenarios have been done in some important cities to have an idea about the probable damages in order to carry out the necessary actions for damage limitation. These scenarios require analysis of elements at risk as buildings etc. The work presented below aims to estimate the seismic vulnerability of the existing buildings in Tizi-Ouzou city (Algeria). For this purpose, capacity curves are developed for the reinforced concrete buildings using push-over method; the analysis is based on the building characteristics given in the plans.

18058,"Fragility curves to assess the seismic risk in reinforced concrete buildings with waffled slabs [Curvas de fragilidad para evaluar el daño sísmico en edificios de concreto armado con losas reticulares] Structures with an inadequate seismic performance are the main source of the human death and economic losses when a major earthquake strikes an urban area. To improve buildings design one have to begin by carrying out seismic risk analysis in urban areas, which permit to assess the seismic vulnerability in these zones and to estimate the probable damage can be suffer by a seismic event. Currently, many of the housings in Barcelona, Spain, are multi-storey waffle slabs reinforced concrete buildings. In fact, this typology is the second most representative in the city and the number of this type of buildings is increasing because, at present, this is the most extended construction system. This work is a contribution to the analysis of the seismic behaviour of this type of buildings and it faces the seismic risk analysis in an urban area situated in a low seismic hazard region. In order to carry out a suitable analysis it is necessary to have enormous information, that often it is not available and, in addition, there exists a great amount of involved uncertainties; therefore, the adequate treatment of the problem is the probabilistic. In this work, the vulnerability and the seismic risk of waffle slabs reinforced concrete buildings are evaluated by means of a methodology based in the capacity spectrum method. The structural models used in the analysis correspond to buildings of 8, 5, 3 and 2 storeys. For each one of these buildings capacity and fragility curves are obtained. For a likely seismic demand in Barcelona, two specific seismic scenarios were considered. Taking into account all these results, the probability damage matrixes are also obtained.

The main purpose of the article is the development of a mathematical model able to predict the chosen mechanical parameters and damage index of brick wallets for a given number of freeze-thaw cycles. For this, a statistical model derived from experimental data is used. As a result, regression curves for Young's modulus and ductility for two types of mortar are obtained. Furthermore, fragility curves for ductility and also the damage index, which is based on displacement ductility, are presented. The obtained results enable probabilistic risk assessments in the case of deteriorated ductility and increased damage on brick masonry due to freeze-thaw cycles. freezing  thawing  brick wallets  experimental  statistical model  fragility curve  damage index MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES  LIME  CONCRETE  MORTARS  CAPACITY  MODELS",Fragility Curves for Material Characteristics and Damage Index for Brick Masonry Exposed to Freeze-Thaw Action,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3078954253456417,0.060314193059379795,0.030652295038398832,0.00951919412840016,Analytical
12791,"Development of Empirical Fragility Curves in Earthquake Engineering considering Nonspecific Damage Information As a function of fragility curves in earthquake engineering, the assessment of the probability of exceeding a specific damage state according to the magnitude of earthquake can be considered. Considering that the damage states for fragility curves are generally nested to each other, the possibility theory, a special form of the evidence theory for nested intervals, is applied to generate fragility information from seismic damage data. While the lognormal distributions are conventionally used to generate fragility curves due to their simplicity and applicability, the methodology to use the possibility theory does not require the assumption of distributions. Seismic damage data classified by four damage levels were used for a case study. The resulted possibility-based fragility information expressed by two monotone measures, possibility and certainty, are compared with the conventional fragility curves based on probability. The results showed that the conventional fragility curves provide a conservative estimation at the relatively high earthquake magnitude compared with the possibility-based fragility information.

The soil classes in the Pisco district were classified into three zones based on the predominant periods of microtremors at 85 sites, and damage ratios were calculated for each zone. Surface ground motions in each zone were estimated on the basis of base-rock motion simulation and shallow soil-column response analysis.

21233,"Seismic Vulnerability of Icelandic Residential Buildings The seismicity in Iceland is related to the Mid-Atlantic plate boundary which crosses the country from north to south. Since 1700, there have been 25 earthquakes of magnitude six or greater in the two major seismic zones in Iceland. For many of the historical earthquakes (older than 100 years), detailed written descriptions are available that describe the damage from farm to farm. For the most recent earthquakes, like the two south Iceland earthquakes of June 2000 and the south Iceland earthquake of May 2008, comprehensive building-by-building loss data exist. The loss data in these cases are split into a number of subcategories of structural and non structural damage. The building stock in south Iceland has changed significantly from 1700 to the present. For ages, vulnerable turf and stone houses dominated, but in the twentieth century, concrete buildings and timber buildings took over. Seismic codes were implemented in 1976 and have gradually improved the seismic capacity of present building stock. In this book chapter, an overview of the seismic performance of old and new Icelandic buildings is given. Observed and reported damage caused by three earthquake sequences and a single event are discussed; first, the damage caused by two earthquakes in August 1784 in south Iceland; then, by the 1896 earthquake sequence in south Iceland; then, the damage after a single event in 1934 in north Iceland; and finally, the loss data from the 2000 and 2008 earthquakes in south Iceland.

The result was used further to calculate seismic risk score (SR) which exhibit the probability of the building damage given the Maximum Considered Earthquake (MCER) that will occur during the Rusunawa service life. The in-depth analysis was conducted by developing fragility function expressed in the form of fragility curves for the Rusunawa. The fragility shows the probability that certain damage states will be exceeded given the intensity of earthquakes which will occur during building service life.

20730,"Seismic fragility of steel moment-resisting frames in Vancouver and Montreal designed in the 1960s, 1980s, and 2010 Typical steel moment-resisting frames (MRF) of six-storey buildings in Vancouver and Montreal were designed for three different provisions of the National Building Code of Canada (1960s, 1980s, and 2010). Numerical models were developed in OpenSees to understand the seismic performance of the structures. These models accounted for strength and stiffness degradation through appropriate representations of the beam-column connection behaviours, which were calibrated against experimental results available in the literature. The behaviour of the buildings was evaluated through pushover and nonlinear time history analyses. The pushover analysis results showed that the 1960s and 2010 steel MRFs of both cities exhibited strong-column-weak-beam failure mode. The 1980s steel MRFs of both cities showed soft-storey mechanism.

19841,"Proposal and application of the Incremental Modal Pushover Analysis (IMPA) In recent years, many research activities were undertaken to develop a reliable and practical analysis procedure to identify the safety level of existing structures: Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA) is considered to be one of the most accurate methods to estimate the seismic demand and capacity of structures. However, the executions of many complex and computationally heavy nonlinear response history analyses (NL-RHA) are required. This paper deals with the proposal of an efficient Incremental Modal Pushover Analysis (IMPA) to obtain capacity curves by replacing the nonlinear response history analysis of the IDA procedure with Modal Pushover Analysis (MPA). In this work, the MPA is extended and applied to three-dimensional asymmetric structures and finally it is used in order to obtain a ""multimodal"" capacity curve: therefore MPA method is used to evaluate both displacements, as in the standard method, and base shear (this is a novelty). According to this approach the proposed procedure (IMPA) is defined and applied to estimate the structure's seismic response and capacity for given seismic actions.

18401,"Improving Post-Earthquake Building Safety Evaluation using the 2015 Gorkha, Nepal, Earthquake Rapid Visual Damage Assessment Data A Rapid Visual Damage Assessment was initiated in the direct aftermath of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake to assess the safety and damage of residential buildings in the areas affected by the earthquake. Over 30,000 paper assessment forms have been subsequently digitized. The collected data set allows comparison of the observed damage to the residential building stock to the damage expected using existing fragility curves. Under certain conditions and respecting certain limitations, the post-earthquake building safety and damage data can be used to update the existing fragility functions for the Nepalese building stock. Recommendations are made for the improvement of post-earthquake building safety assessments in Nepal in order to: (1) make data collection more consistent, (2) increase the accuracy of the collected data, and (3) make more effective use of the collected data after future earthquakes.

18810,"Masonry structures: A proposal of analytical generation of fragility functions for tsunami impact – Application to the Mediterranean coasts Evaluation of tsunami vulnerability of coastal buildings is gaining high interest in recent years in the areas with high tsunami hazard. Fragility evaluation is a fundamental step to obtain a quantitative estimation of the probability of building damage and in order to define possible strategies for risk mitigation. Several empirical fragility curves are available for masonry structures. However, an empirical fragility curve is generally based on field surveys after tsunami events, not always available. Conversely, analytical fragility curves are based on prediction approaches. In this paper, a proposal for the evaluation of analytical fragility curves for masonry structures typical of the Mediterranean coasts based on simplified structural analyses and damage indexes is presented. The proposal considers the uncertainties in both the structural demand and capacity probabilistically. Several Monte Carlo simulations on some masonry structure types have been carried out to evaluate the fragility related to each fixed damage state assuming the inundation depth as intensity measure. Finally, the validity of the results is discussed by comparisons with empirical fragility curves available in the literature. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd Fragility curves  Masonry structures  Tsunami fragility functions  Tsunami loads  Vulnerability Damage detection  Function evaluation  Intelligent systems  Monte Carlo methods  Risk perception  Building damage  Fragility curves  Fragility function  Masonry structures  Mediterranean coasts  Quantitative estimation  Tsunami fragility function  Tsunami hazards  Tsunami loads  Vulnerability  Tsunamis  analytical framework  damage mechanics  loading  masonry  Monte Carlo analysis  multistorey building  structural analysis  structural response  tsunami  vulnerability",Masonry structures: A proposal of analytical generation of fragility functions for tsunami impact – Application to the Mediterranean coasts,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7261728955889992,0.05549716605185503,0.18429178407585106,0.007900349476040909,Analytical

18691,"Large-scale seismic risk assessment integrating nonlinear soil behavior and soil–structure interaction effects The need for an accurate risk assessment procedure led to the development of various fragility and vulnerability curves, covering a wide range of building typologies. Nonlinear soil behavior and soil–structure interaction (SSI) effects play an essential role in this outcome; nevertheless, their influence is usually neglected. While for building-specific applications, these effects may be explicitly considered, it is currently impossible to account for such effects in large-scale seismic risk analyses. We examine the effectiveness of a broad set of fragility modifiers (FM) that shift existing fragility curves appropriately to consider nonlinear soil behavior and/or SSI. We apply our method to an existing block of—mainly—residential buildings in Thessaloniki, Greece. To derive the fragility curves for the building block, we perform (i) incremental dynamic analyses of the existing individual structures considering nonlinear soil behavior and SSI, (ii) incremental dynamic analyses of the existing structures neglecting the underlying soil, (iii) fragility assessment using existing fragility curves found in literature and (iv) fragility assessment using existing fragility curves found in literature, but modified using our proposed FM to account for nonlinear soil behavior and SSI. Next, assessment is also performed in terms of vulnerability. A comparison between the obtained results highlights the effectiveness of the proposed FM for large-scale risk assessment, and the necessity to consider soil-related effects. In particular, the results are compared in terms of fragility and vulnerability. Since the selection of the block is representative of the city center of Thessaloniki, our results will be indicative for city-level applications. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

21456,"Spectrum displacement based seismic fragility curves for China high rises High-rise buildings, as a result of rapid urbanization in China, become one of popular structure kind. However, been few seismic vulnerability studies on high-rise buildings have been done, and few fragility curves were developed for the buildings. Our study is based on the published data from more than 50 high rises and super high rises. The structural information such as building heights, mode periods, locations and sites, and the maximum design story drift ratios, are collected and analyzed. By considering the structural primary periods, buildings are categories into different height groups. Geological conditions of the building site such as soil types, site characteristic periods, are also considered. The vulnerability analysis for high rises uses response spectrum displacement as seismic ground motion input, since the structures have comparatively long natural period. Statistics and regression analysis of linear least square method are used. The relationship between the maximum story drift ratio and response spectrum displacement is established. With cumulative normal distribution, and based on height groups and earthquake design codes, the fragility curves of different performance levels have been developed. These curves provide good estimation of high rise structural damage under earthquake ground motion.

17421,"Estimating seismic demand models of a building inventory from nonlinear static analysis using deep learning methods Probabilistic seismic demand analysis (PSDA) is the most time- and effort-intensive step in risk-based assessment of the built environment. A typical PSDA requires subjecting the structure to a large number of ground motions and performing nonlinear dynamic analysis, where the analysis dimension and effort substantially increase at large-scale assessments such as community-level evaluations. This study presents a deep learning framework to estimate seismic demand models from nonlinear static (i.e., pushover) analysis, which is computationally inexpensive. The proposed architecture leverages an encoder–decoder model with customized training schedules and a loss function capable of determining demand model parameters and error. Furthermore, the framework facilitates the seamless incorporation of structural modeling uncertainties in PSDA. The proposed framework is then applied to a building inventory consisting of 720 concrete frames to examine its generalizability and accuracy. The results show that the deep learning architecture can estimate demand models by an R2 of 84% using a test-to-train ratio of unity. In addition, the average prediction error is less than 3% and 6% for demand model slope and intercept parameters, respectively, translating into an accurate estimation of fragility functions with a median error of 5.7%, 6.9%, and 6.8% for immediate occupancy, life safety, and collapse prevention damage states. Lastly, the framework can efficiently propagate structural uncertainties into seismic demand models, capturing the implicit relationship of the frames’ nonlinear characteristics and resultant fragility functions.

13599,"Vulnerability assessment using fragility curves The use of fragility curves for the assessment of seismic losses is in increasing demand, both for pre-earthquake disaster planning as well as post-earthquake recovery and retrofitting programs. Fragility curves; important components of accurate risk assessment are functions that describe the probability of failure, conditioned on the full range of loads to which a system might be exposed. In general fragility curves provide estimates for the probabilities of a structure reaching/ exceeding limiting deformation at given levels of ground shaking or it is a plot of the computed probability (deflection) Vs. Ground motion parameter. The scope of the proposed research is to develop fragility curves as a tool to develop suitable measures that can help in estimating the losses for the structures, similar to the case study building and thus to develop the same as an important tool in earthquake engineering mainly for urban risk reduction. The objective of the proposed study is the reliability assessment of the case study building to earthquake loadings through the development of fragility curves. The vulnerability of the structure is expressed with the development of fragility curves, which provides the probability of exceeding a prescribed level of damage for a wide range of ground motion intensities. Primary task is to identify a case study structure for which fragility curves are not developed yet and which could effectively represent the structural viability of present and future buildings. It is based on a concept that similar type of structures (structural typology) will have same probability of a given damage state for given earthquake intensity. Hence effective methods to develop fragility curves for representative buildings are very vital in earthquake engineering. We propose to develop fragility curves for a building with flat-slabs and shear wall system which effectively represents recent high rise buildings particularly in GCC countries. © Research India Publications.

Djamil Hospital is the largest public medical facility in Padang area with over 800 patient beds. The magnitude 7.6 Western Sumatra earthquake of September 30, 2009 caused the first floor of one housing outpatient services collapsed. Padang city is located in West Sumatra province which is recorded as an earthquake and tsunami prone area in Indonesia. Risk reduction strategy can be implemented by assessing the vulnerability of building through fragility curve. In this study, the fragility curve was carried out to an existing Maternity and Childrens's M. Djamil Hospital building due to earthquake and tsunami in sequence. Building's structural was modelled in ETABS v. 17 and analyzed by using Pushover analysis and Nonlinear Time History analysis. This structural model was subjected through a total of 40 ground motion data from El Centro, Northridge, Kobe and Padang. Each ground motion data was normalized from 0.2g to 2.0g of peak ground acceleration and continued with tsunami load. Analysis results consist of drift at yield point and structure maximum drift, which are then generated into a fragility curve based on Hazus standard.

15571,"Analysing the effects of flood-resilience technologies in urban areas using a synthetic model approach Flood protection systems with their spatial effects play an important role in managing and reducing flood risks. The planning and decision process as well as the technical implementation are well organized and often exercised. However, building-related flood-resilience technologies (FReT) are often neglected due to the absence of suitable approaches to analyse and to integrate such measures in large-scale flood damage mitigation concepts. Against this backdrop, a synthetic model-approach was extended by few complementary methodical steps in order to calculate flood damage to buildings considering the effects of building-related FReT and to analyse the area-related reduction of flood risks by geo-information systems (GIS) with high spatial resolution. It includes a civil engineering based investigation of characteristic properties with its building construction including a selection and combination of appropriate FReT as a basis for derivation of synthetic depth-damage functions. Depending on the real exposition and the implementation level of FReT, the functions can be used and allocated in spatial damage and risk analyses. The application of the extended approach is shown at a case study in Valencia (Spain). In this way, the overall research findings improve the integration of FReT in flood risk management. They provide also some useful information for advising of individuals at risk supporting the selection and implementation of FReT.

Se utiliza una red neuronal artificial de tres capas y un algoritmo de aprendizaje tipo Kohonen, así como conjuntos difusos para manipular información subjetiva como las calificaciones de los niveles de daño presentes en los edificios evaluados. También se aplica una base de reglas difusas para contribuir al proceso de toma de decisiones.

18900,"Modeling and fragility analysis of non-ductile reinforced concrete buildings in low-to-moderate seismic zones Reinforced concrete buildings in low-to-moderate seismic zones are often designed only for gravity loads in accordance with the non-seismic detailing provisions. Deficient detailing of columns and beam-column joints can lead to unpredictable brittle failures even under moderate earthquakes. Therefore, a reliable estimate of structural response is required for the seismic evaluation of these structures. For this purpose, analytical models for both interior and exterior slab-beam-column subassemblages and for a 1/3 scale model frame were implemented into the nonlinear finite element platform OpenSees. Comparison between the analytical results and experimental data available in the literature is carried out using nonlinear pushover analyses and nonlinear time history analysis for the subassemblages and the model frame, respectively. Furthermore, the seismic fragility assessment of reinforced concrete buildings is performed on a set of non-ductile frames using nonlinear time history analyses.

17921,"Fragility analysis of pier-supported wharf Seismic damage assessment plays an important role in performancebased design engineering and seismic risk analysis. This assessment is dealt with in terms of fragility curves. An approach to estimate seismic fragility of a pier-supported wharf is developed in this paper. The damage or performance state of the specific wharf structure is determined by the capacity spectrum method proposed by ATC-40. The probability distribution for a so-called fragility curve is expressed in a lognormal cumulative probability density function and the two parameters associated with the distribution are estimated by the maximum likelihood method, treating each event of damage as a realization from a Bernoulli experiment. In this paper, we consider the uncertainty associated with the ground motion by collecting the records of ground motion near the site and analyzing the probabilistic characteristics of the records. We also analyze the uncertainties associated with the capacity spectrum and the thresholds of different damage states by considering the factors of material and soil properties that affect the overall capacity of the structure. Finally, fragility curves considering the above three type of uncertainties are constructed and compared for the target pier-supported wharf.

Since the ground motion records are limited for the April 25, 2015, Nepal earthquake, a MATLAB code is written to generate the artificial ground motion records considering each mandal as a site location. Earlier written MATLAB code has been modified with a correction function to obtain synthetic accelerograms at each station. A spatial seismic hazard distribution is plotted through Geographical Information System (GIS) software. Seismic fragility curves are drawn to estimate the damage of buildings. From the results, it is observed that around 22% of buildings experienced an intensity of VI on the MMI scale at Bageswari mandal. A few buildings have experienced an intensity of VII in Thankot, Seuchatar, Satikhel, Mahadevathan, Indrayani, Chhaimale, and Balambu.

16734,"Decision-tree analysis of factors influencing rainfall-related building structure and content damage Flood-damage prediction models are essential building blocks in flood risk assessments. So far, little research has been dedicated to damage from small-scale urban floods caused by heavy rainfall, while there is a need for reliable damage models for this flood type among insurers and water authorities. The aim of this paper is to investigate a wide range of damage-influencing factors and their relationships with rainfall-related damage, using decision-tree analysis. For this, district-aggregated claim data from private property insurance companies in the Netherlands were analysed, for the period 1998-2011. The databases include claims of water-related damage (for example, damages related to rainwater intrusion through roofs and pluvial flood water entering buildings at ground floor). Response variables being modelled are average claim size and claim frequency, per district, per day. The set of predictors include rainfall-related variables derived from weather radar images, topographic variables from a digital terrain model, building-related variables and socioeconomic indicators of households. Analyses were made separately for property and content damage claim data. Results of decision-tree analysis show that claim frequency is most strongly associated with maximum hourly rainfall intensity, followed by real estate value, ground floor area, household income, season (property data only), buildings age (property data only), a fraction of home-owners (content data only), a and fraction of low-rise buildings (content data only). It was not possible to develop statistically acceptable trees for average claim size. It is recommended to investigate explanations for the failure to derive models. These require the inclusion of other explanatory factors that were not used in the present study, an investigation of the variability in average claim size at different spatial scales, and the collection of more detailed insurance data that allows one to distinguish between the effects of various damage mechanisms to claim size. Cross-validation results show that decision trees were able to predict 22-26% of variance in claim frequency, which is considerably better compared to results from global multiple regression models (11-18% of variance explained). Still, a large part of the variance in claim frequency is left unexplained, which is likely to be caused by variations in data at subdistrict scale and missing explanatory variables. © Author(s) 2014.

Taking the ultimate point as reference point, the pushover curves are converted into parameterless pushover curves. Analyzing the relationships among the initial yielding point, significant yielding point, ultimate point and other key point in parameter-less pushover curves. the parameterless pushover curve is transformed to pushover curve according to the seismic design level of the estimated building.

21131,"Seismic vulnerability assessment of confined masonry wall buildings In this paper the vulnerability of the confined masonry buildings is evaluated analytically. The proposed approach includes the nonlinear dynamic analysis of the two-story confined masonry buildings with common plan as a reference structure. In this approach the damage level is calculated based on the probability of exceedance of loss vs a specified ground motion in the form of fragility curves. The fragility curves of confined masonry wall buildings are presented in two levels of limit states corresponding to elastic and maximum strength versus PGA based on analytical method. In this regard the randomness of parameters indicating the characteristics of the building structure as well as ground motion is considered as likely uncertainties. In order to develop the analytical fragility curves the proposed analytical models of confined masonry walls in a previous investigation of the authors, are used to specify the damage indices and responses of the structure. In order to obtain damage indices a series of pushover analyses are performed, and to identify the seismic demand a series of nonlinear dynamic analysis are conducted. Finally by considering various mechanical and geometric parameters of masonry walls and numerous accelerograms, the fragility curves with assuming a log normal distribution of data are derived based on capacity and demand of building structures in a probabilistic approach. © 2014 Techno-Press, Ltd.

20587,"Seismic fragility analysis of SRC frame structures With the rapid development and extensive application of SRC (steel reinforced concrete) frame structures, the study on seismic fragility of SRC structure under earthquakes seems rather important. The seismic fragility of the SRC frame structures is studied by the method of Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA) in this paper. IDA method is conducted on 9 storey SRC frame structure to obtain the IDA curves of this model. Meanwhile, the seismic fragility of the model is analyzed to get the fragility curve.

17734,"Facade damage assessment of multi-storey buildings in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake The magnitude 6.3 earthquake that struck Christchurch on the 22 nd February 2011 caused widespread damage to the multi-storey buildings within Christchurch's central business district (CBD). Damage to the facades of these buildings was a clear contributor to the overall building damage. This paper presents the damage assessment of the facade systems from a survey of 217 multi-storey buildings in the Christchurch CBD. The survey covers only buildings greater than three stories in height, excluding the majority of unreinforced masonry facades, of which damage has been well documented. Since a building can have more than one type of facade system, a total of 371 facade systems are surveyed. Observation of facade damage is discussed and is presented in terms of its performance level. Trends in facade performance are examined in relation the structural parameters such as construction age and height.

17198,"Effect of infills on seismic resilience of special steel moment resisting frames This study evaluates the effects of infills on the seismic resilience of special steel moment resisting frames. For this purpose, three structures of 4, 8 and 12 story are selected and designed in three different modes namely without infills, with Infills and with infills having openings. Finite element models are developed in OpenSees software. Seismic capacity and demand of structures are calculated using incremental dynamic analysis (IDA). Then, using statistical methods and probabilistic functions based on inter story drifts of the structures, fragility curves are obtained according to the HAZUS instructions. Finally, by quantifying damages, changes in seismic resilience are assessed. This makes it possible to relate the probability functions, fragility and resilience curves in an integrated approach. The results of the analysis show that infills may significantly reduce structural damages and an increase its resilience at different risk levels. The role of infills in increasing the resilience index is highlighted by the increase in risk level. This increase has been far more significant in low rise frames. It is also observed that the decreasing effect of infill openings in resilience index of high-rise buildings is less than low-rise ones although insignificant in some cases which can be overlooked. © 2021 Fragility curves  Incremental dynamic analysis  Masonry infill  Seismic resilience  Steel moment frame None",Effect of infills on seismic resilience of special steel moment resisting frames,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.379341446046157,0.018365355916622486,0.014548840404961369,0.00757636278192868,Analytical

Further, using the synthetics, incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) is conducted on a typical six story concrete moment resisting frame building and IDA curves are constructed with residual drift ratio (%) versus spectral acceleration at fundamental period [Sa (T1, 5%)]. Furthermore, analytical fragility curves are derived for each damage state based on FEMA P-58, for determining the seismic performance of concrete frames in the event of an earthquake in the study region. The results reveal that at Sa (T1, 5%) of 1.0 g, there is an 86% and 68% probability of non-structural damage and slight structural damage respectively.

16266,"Comparison and modelling of building losses in South Iceland caused by different size earthquakes In June 2000, two earthquakes of Mw6.52 and Mw6.44 occurred with a 4-day interval in the South Iceland seismic zone, and in May 2008, a Mw6.30 earthquake occurred further west in the zone. Their epicentres and fault ruptures were close to small towns and farms, and almost 5000 residential buildings were affected in each of these two seismic events. Despite substantial damage, no residential building collapsed and there were no fatalities. Catastrophe insurance of buildings is mandatory in Iceland. Driven by insurance claims, repair cost was estimated for every affected building, and registered in two independent datasets, called hereafter the 2000 and the 2008 dataset. Two complete loss datasets from different size earthquakes, affecting the same building typologies in the same region is rare to find in the literature. Valuable information can be drawn by comparing the losses caused by these events on the housing stock. In this study an advanced empirical vulnerability model based on zero-inflated beta regression was fitted to five building typologies, based on GEM taxonomy, independently for the 2000 dataset and the 2008 dataset. The peak ground acceleration (PGA) was used as intensity measure. The vulnerability model and the fragility curves are substantially different from these two datasets. For a given PGA, the mean losses based on the 2000 dataset was typically roughly twice that based on the 2008 dataset. Such a large difference in losses for similar building types located in the same area indicates that PGA is not alone an adequate intensity measure to predict losses. The study also showed that high code buildings performed better than low code buildings. © 2021 The Authors ESRM20  Fragility functions  GEM taxonomy  Seismic codes  Seismic vulnerability  Zero-inflated beta regression Earthquakes  Housing  Insurance  Different sizes  ESRM20  Fragility function  GEM taxonomy  Icelands  Peak ground acceleration  Seismic code  Seismic vulnerability  Zero-inflated  Zero-inflated beta regression  Taxonomies",Comparison and modelling of building losses in South Iceland caused by different size earthquakes,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06835623006669808,0.39605209136476077,0.1364276270516281,0.007783181904500286,Empirical
13259,"Rapid Flood Damage Prediction and Forecasting Using Public Domain Cadastral and Address Point Data with Fuzzy Logic Algorithms National Flood Interoperability Experiment (NFIE) derived technologies and workflows will offer the ability to rapidly forecast flood damages. Address Points used by emergency management personnel approximate the locations of buildings, and they are a common operating picture for emergency responders. Most United States (U.S.) county tax assessment offices throughout the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) produce georeferenced cadastral data. To varying degrees, these parcel data describe building characteristics of structures within the parcel. Address Point data with cadastral data offers the ability to rapidly develop building inventories for flood damage estimation. Flood damage forecasts can expedite recovery and improve short-term flood resilience. In this work the authors evaluate Flood Damage Wizard, a proposed open source platform independent methodology. Flood Damage Wizard uses point shapefile building information to estimate flood damage to buildings by finding the appropriate depth-damage function using fuzzy-text matching. The authors apply Flood Damage Wizard using Address Point and parcel datasets to demonstrate a method of estimating flood damage to buildings nearly anywhere within the CONUS.

20518,"Seismic Failure Probability of a Curved Bridge Based on Analytical and Neural Network Approaches This study focuses on seismic fragility assessment of horizontal curved bridge, which has been derived by neural network prediction. The objective is the optimization of structural responses of metaheuristic solutions. A regression model for the responses of the horizontal curved bridge with variable coefficients is built in the neural networks simulation environment based on the existing NTHA data. In order to achieve accurate results in a neural network, 1677 seismic analysis was performed in OpenSees. To achieve better performance of neural network and reduce the dimensionality of input data, dimensionality reduction techniques such as factor analysis approach were applied. Different types of neural network training algorithm were used and the best algorithm was adopted. The developed ANN approach is then used to verify the fragility curves of NTHA. The obtained results indicated that neural network approach could be used for predicting the seismic behavior of bridge elements and fragility, with enough feature extraction of ground motion records and response of structure according to the statistical works.

18836,"Mechanical-Analytical Soil-Dependent Fragility Curves of Existing RC Frames with Column-Driven Failures In seismic risk estimation, among the different types of fragility curves used (judgement-based, mechanical, empirical/observational, hybrid), the mechanical ones have the twofold advantage of allowing a better control over the basic parameters and of representing a validation test of the consistency of empirical/observational ones. In this study, fragility curves of RC frames with column-driven failures are obtained from a simplified analytical pushover method implemented in a simple spreadsheet, thus allowing the user to perform a large number of analyses. More importantly, the proposed method introduces the concept that Limit States at the structural level are obtained consequent to the attainment of the same Limit States at the local level, in the columns' sections. This avoids using additional criteria, such as interstorey drift thresholds. This simple analytical model allows for rapid development of fragility curves, for any Limit State, of different building typologies identified by a set of global quantities (number of storeys, story heights, number of spans and span lengths) and by a set of local quantities (element sizes, reinforcement, and material properties). It also allows for a straightforward treatment of the influence of the soil class on the fragility curves parameters, which is another critical issue addressed in this work that helps when interpreting some literature results using empirical/observational methods. mechanical fragility curves  analytical pushover analysis  typological seismic vulnerability  soil influence on fragility curves SEISMIC FRAGILITY  DAMAGE DATA  VULNERABILITY  BUILDINGS  EARTHQUAKES  LAQUILA",Mechanical-Analytical Soil-Dependent Fragility Curves of Existing RC Frames with Column-Driven Failures,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2715241525421436,0.03042586395269486,0.2081422651274897,0.0091001546633172,Analytical
19411,"Performance Assessment of Steel Moment-Resisting Frame Structures Using Fragility Methodology This paper presents a probabilistic study using the fragility function method for the performance assessment of two 1/6-scale, single-bay, three- and eight-story steel moment-resisting frame structures representing rigid and flexible framed structures, respectively. Considering the impact of the uncertainties in seismic loading and response of structures, the adopted fragility methodology is believed to provide a realistic and robust assessment of seismic performance and vulnerability of the structures. Fragility curves were developed by considering appropriate performance levels and using the response data from nonlinear time-history analyses of the structures in longitudinal and transverse directions with respective moment and shear connections. Results of the fragility analysis showed that inclusion of panel zone reinforcement in numerical simulation of the framed structures lowers the seismic vulnerability and probability of damage to the structures. The relatively lower seismic performances of the structures in the transverse direction with shear connections and lower lateral stiffness were demonstrated as well. Moreover, the eight-story structure was found to be more vulnerable to seismic loading and severe damages compared to the three-story structure. The adopted fragility method can serve as an effective tool for assessing the performance and safety levels of structures, and in decision making as well as financing for seismic protection.

12804,"Development of seismic fragility curves for mixed masonry-RC buildings in Lisbon Seismic vulnerability assessment of the old buildings assumes great importance, not only because of the obvious physical consequences in the eventual occurrence of a seismic event, but also because it is the aspect in which engineering research can intervene. Unfortunately, due to the lack of knowledge and uncertainties, which appear in case of old existing building in general, or in mixed masonry-reinforced concrete buildings in particular, the assessment of the seismic vulnerability is undoubtedly a challenging task. The object of this paper is to assess the seismic behaviour of mixed masonry-reinforced concrete building class through the nonlinear static sensitivity analyses by considering the uncertainty that reflects the inherent variability of the outcome of a repeatable experiment (aleatory uncertainty) and the seismic demand as provided by EC8. To the latter goal, results from these analyses are used to define the Intensity Measure (IM LS ) and dispersion (β LS ) to the final aim to obtain the fragility curves by quantitatively assessing the effect due to the variability of seismic demand and structural capacity. © 2018 The International Masonry Society (IMS).

17548,"Evaluation of the variability contribution due to epistemic uncertainty on constitutive models in the definition of fragility curves of RC frames In the framework of uncertainty propagation in seismic analyses, most of the research efforts were devoted to quantifying and reducing uncertainties related to seismic input. However, also uncertainties associated to the definition of constitutive models must be taken into account, in order to have a reliable estimate of the total uncertainty in structural response. The present paper, by means of incremental dynamic analyses on reinforced concrete frames, evaluates the effect of the epistemic uncertainty for plastic-hinges hysteretic models selection. Eleven different hysteretic models, identified based on literature data, were used and seismic fragility curves were obtained for three different levels of maximum interstorey drift ratio. Finally, by means of analysis of variance techniques, the paper shows that the uncertainty associated to the hysteretic model definition has a magnitude similar to that due to record-to-record variability. © 2019 The Authors ANOVA  Constitutive model  Modelling uncertainty  Reinforced Concrete buildings  Seismic fragilities Analysis of variance (ANOVA)  Concrete buildings  Constitutive models  Hysteresis  Reinforced concrete  Seismology  Epistemic uncertainties  Incremental dynamic analysis  Reinforced concrete frames  Seismic fragility  Seismic fragility curves  Structural response  Total uncertainties  Uncertainty propagation  Uncertainty analysis  concrete structure  dynamic response  numerical model  reinforced concrete  seismic response  structural response  uncertainty analysis  variance analysis",Evaluation of the variability contribution due to epistemic uncertainty on constitutive models in the definition of fragility curves of RC frames,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40547698249742725,0.011915636791882431,0.006230887487450598,0.02618819027555643,Analytical
18499,"Influence of soil-structure interaction on fragility assessment of building structures In this work, 3D reinforced concrete (RC) and steel building structures have been considered for studying the effect of soil-structure interaction modelling on the structural fragility assessment of such structures. In particular, three foundation models were considered: fixed model where soil-structure interaction is neglected, spring model with single-node Winkler springs and pile foundation model where soil-structure interaction is simulated using beam and quadrilateral finite elements for the pile and soil numerical simulation, respectively. For the assessment of the structural performance and the influence of the various soil-structure interaction numerical simulation models, fragility analysis is applied by considering four limit-states. For the purpose of the current study 3D, low-, mid-and high-rise RC and steel buildings are studied. The test examples employed in this study were designed first according to Eurocodes 2, 3 and 8 using the SCADA Pro analysis and design software and then nonlinear static analyses were performed for developing the fragility curves. Comparing the outcome of fragility analysis it was observed that for the case of the low-and mid-rise buildings, the structural performance was not affected significantly by the foundation system. However, it was observed that the foundation system contributes considerably to the overall structural performance of the high-rise structures examined.

15283,"A performance-based adaptive methodology for the seismic evaluation of multi-span simply supported deck bridges A performance-based adaptive methodology for the seismic assessment of highway bridges is proposed. The proposed methodology is based on an Inverse (I), Adaptive (A) application of the Capacity Spectrum Method (CSM), with the capacity curve of the bridge derived through a Displacement-based Adaptive Pushover (DAP) analysis. For this reason, the acronym IACSM is used to identify the proposed methodology. A number of Performance Levels (PLs), for which the seismic vulnerability and seismic risk of the bridge shall be evaluated, are identified. Each PL is associated to a number of Damage States (DSs) of the critical members of the bridge (piers, abutments, joints and bearing devices). The IACSM provides the earthquake intensity level (PGA) corresponding to the attainment of the selected DSs, using over-damped elastic response spectra as demand curves. The seismic vulnerability of the bridge is described by means of fragility curves, derived based on the PGA values associated to each DS. The seismic risk of the bridge is evaluated as convolution integral of the product between the fragility curves and the seismic hazard curve of the bridge site. In this paper, the key aspects and basic assumptions of the proposed methodology are presented first. The IACSM is then applied to nine existing simply supported deck bridges, characterized by different types of piers and bearing devices. Finally, the IACSM predictions are compared with the results of nonlinear response time-history analysis, carried out using a set of seven ground motions scaled to the expected PGA values. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

20598,"Seismic fragility analysis of URM buildings founded on piles: influence of dynamic soil-structure interaction models The impact of adopting different dynamic soil-structure interaction (SSI) models on the assessment of seismic fragility functions for buildings with pile foundations is studied herein. Given the importance on seismic response of the coupling of structure, foundation and soil, and the challenges posed on modelling dynamic SSI, especially when soil nonlinearity plays a significant role, the linear substructure approach is initially adopted by implementing two different models, followed by the use of a nonlinear pile-head macro-element. The first model is one-dimensional and includes, between the foundation node and the ground, only a translational elastic spring and a dashpot, whose stiffness and viscous damping are retrieved from the real and imaginary parts of the dynamic impedance at the first natural frequency of the structure. The second and more refined model is a Lumped-Parameter Model accounting for frequency dependence of the coupled horizontal and rotational impedances in a two-dimensional response. A nonlinear pile-head macro-element model is introduced afterwards to explore the sensitivity of fragility functions to the linearity assumption. This approach models the soil nonlinear behaviour at near-field, as well as the far-field dynamic impedance and energy dissipation through radiation damping, by condensing the entire soil-foundation system into a single nonlinear element at the base of the superstructure. In all models, the superstructure is represented in a simplified way as a nonlinear single-degree-of-freedom system. The comparison between the adopted approaches is evaluated in terms of their effects on the characterisation of fragility functions for unreinforced masonry buildings with pile foundations.

20637,"Seismic fragility assessment of model buildings in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is located near an active seismic zone; the Zagros folded belt and the Makran subduction zone in Iran. The Mb5 earthquake on 11 March 2002 in Masafi in the UAE highlighted the potential risk posed by local seismic sources. However, the seismic hazard is generally considered to be low to moderate in the UAE, depending on the proximity to the seismic sources. The objective of this study was to assess the fragility of buildings in Sharjah City when subjected to the probable seismic hazard. Sharjah City was divided into areas, and the buildings and the population data were collected for each area. The buildings were then classified according to their usage, heights and structural systems. The buildings were classified and model representative buildings were assigned for each of the different areas in Sharjah. Seismic fragility analysis was performed for each representative building to assess its performance under the probable seismic hazard using time history analysis and the fragility curves were prepared for each building type. The results of the study showed that the buildings that were not designed for earthquake resistance were most venerable. Finally, probable losses were estimated using available loss functions and a GIS database was developed for the city. © 2018 Esprit. All rights reserved.

12525,"A general framework for the estimation of analytical fragility functions based on multivariate probability distributions A fragility curve is a function that expresses the probability of failure of a structure or component as a function of the intensity of external aggression. This paper proposes a general framework for the development of analytical fragility functions from data based on the copula approach. Such a model allows for any kinds of marginal distributions and dependence structures so that it can be applied to various types of fragility data, analytical or empirical. The fragility function is then derived from the joint distribution of intensity and damage measures. The Bayesian information criterion is used to select the most plausible model among the candidate joint distributions, given the data. The practical implementation of the methodology is illustrated by an analytical test case and by the evaluation of seismic fragility curves for a reinforced concrete building. Several candidate marginal distributions, in agreement with the nature and the physical properties of the variables (e.g. common intensity and damage measures take only positive values) are evaluated. In particular, seismic intensity measures are lognormal random variables according to seismological models.

16833,"Developing fragility curves based on neural network IDA predictions A Soft Computing (SC) based framework for the fragility assessment of 3D buildings is proposed in this work. The computational effort required for a fragility analysis of structural systems can become excessive, far beyond the capability of modern computing systems, especially when dealing with real-world structures. For the purpose of making attainable fragility analyses, a Neural Network (NN) implementation is presented in this work, which can provide accurate predictions of the structural response at a fraction of computational time required by a conventional analysis. The main advantage of using NN predictions is that they can deal with problems, without having an algorithmic solution or with an algorithmic solution that is too complex to be found. The proposed methodology is applied to 3D reinforced concrete buildings where it was found that with the proposed implementation of NN, a reduction of one order of magnitude is achieved in the computational effort for performing a full fragility analysis.

20621,"Seismic fragility assessment of effectiveness of viscous dampers in R/C buildings under scenario earthquakes Fragility curves are used to represent the probabilities that the structural damages, under various level of seismic excitation, exceed specified damage states by means of earthquake intensity-damage relations. In this study, the fragility curves have been developed for comparative seismic evaluation of several retrofitting measures by incorporation of fluid viscous (VS) dampers applied to a representative high-rise reinforced concrete (R/C) office building located in Istanbul. In the retrofitting strategies considered, similar type of VS dampers was used and designed to provide the structure with three different effective damping ratios of 10%, 15%, and 20%. In the fragility analysis, a set of 240 artificially generated earthquake ground motions compatible with the design spectrum selected to represent the variability in ground motion was employed to study nonlinear dynamic responses of the structures before and after retrofit. Four damage states: slight, moderate, major, and collapse were defined to express the condition of damage. The fragility curves in this study are represented by lognormal distribution functions with two parameters and developed as a function of peak ground acceleration (PGA), spectral acceleration (Sa), spectral displacement (Sd). Comparison of the fragility curves indicated that the VS dampers were very effective in attenuating seismic structural response under various earthquake ground motions. It was also found that a two-fold reduction in the probability of exceeding damage states might be achieved by introducing passive VS damper systems. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The form of the vulnerability evaluation procedure in HAZUS99, which is widely adopted in US and world wide, is taken as reference. A hybrid approach integrated the Simplex with the Generic Algorithm is adopted to inverse the parameters of capacity curve and fragility curve from the earthquake damage matrix of local buildings.

12745,"Damage estimation in reinforced concrete buildings from induced earthquakes in Brazil Large reserves of unexploited shale gas in Brazil have recently been reported, some of them located near densely populated cities. Obviously, the possibility for commercial exploitation of these resources has suddenly arisen, although such activities have been found to be correlated with the occurrence of induced earthquakes in other parts of the word. As in many other countries, in Brazil, making provision for the eventual effects of induced seismicity was not a consideration when the seismic standards were developed. Today, we do know about the possibility of induced earthquakes occurring, but the knowledge about the potential extent of the resulting damages remains imperfect, at best. Consequently, studies such as the one presented here, and another recently completed, are a first step to improve the knowledge base of the potential risk of induced earthquakes in Brazil for devising adequate risk-control mechanisms. This study assesses the probabilistic response to induced earthquakes of prevalent low-rise engineered reinforced concrete buildings in Brazil. Fragility functions are developed, considering structural and non-structural damage, and including the structural contribution of masonry infills. It was found that, when infill walls do not work as structural components, structural damage is more likely to occur, and conversely, when they do, non-structural damage is significant. The latter effect is produced by the reduction of the natural period of vibration, which exacerbates damage on interior components sensitive to floor acceleration. The likelihood of non-structural damage is not negligible and thus should be considered by decision makers.

The fragility curve is calibrated to the incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) curve based on building materials and frame heights. The frames are designed according to Eurocodes. This study uses seven ground motion records for NF and another seven records for FF. The five performance levels prescribed by FEMA-273 are used as structure performance benchmarks in generating the IDA curve. Results based on the NF and FF records indicate that a three-storey steel frame is stiffer than a concrete frame. By contrast, the results for a six-storey structure show that a steel frame is more suitable than low-rise and mid-rise frames.

17137,"Earthquake vulnerability of reinforced concrete buildings in northern Morocco [Vulnérabilité sismique des constructions de type béton armé au Nord du Maroc] The concept of earth quake vulnerability is used in this work to predict the average damage that buildings are likely to experience on a large scale with the occurrence of an earthquake of given intensity. The use of the vulnerability concept is considered in the context of the particular typology of reinforced concrete buildings, which are commonly encountered in northern Morocco and which have not been engineered with adequate earthquake protection. The vulnerability scale is adapted based on the Italian method called ""Gruppo Nazionale per la Difesa dai Terremoti"" (GNDT) by adjusting the weighting coefficients to better match the local architectural characteristics of these types of buildings. A correlation is then proposed between the damage index considered as the main tracked effect and the causes that are herein idealized through the vulnerability concept. The results of field observations performed after the strong earthquake in Al Hoceima of magnitude 6.3 that hit the region of northern Morocco in 2004 have shown that the proposed method can correctly evaluate vulnerability. Relative fragility curves for this building typology are finally depicted. © 2008 CNRC Canada.

13544,"The use of empirical vulnerability functions to assess the response of buildings to tsunami impact: Comparative review and summary of best practice The increased availability of post-tsunami damage data over the past decade has led to a growing inventory of empirical vulnerability functions that model the damage response of buildings to tsunamis. At present, these functions are highly varied with respect to the building typologies and damage states that they represent, making it difficult to apply them effectively in tsunami vulnerability and loss assessments. This paper provides a detailed review of the methods that have been used to develop empirical vulnerability functions and identifies the key factors that are contributing to the variation seen in existing functions. Categorisation and direct comparison of existing functions show that the variation in previous work is due to significant differences in the accuracy of the hazard assessment techniques that are used, inconsistent and poorly defined damage state and building typology classification systems, the use of error-prone and incorrectly applied statistical methods and the use of post-event data that is not representative of the building damage occurring in study areas. As a result of these findings, recommendations for future work include: (1) using more accurate hazard assessment methods; (2) applying more consistent damage state classification methodologies; (3) implementing more precise building typology classification systems; and (4) ensuring that the tsunami-impacted buildings used to generate vulnerability functions are representative of the full damage and hazard range occurring in impacted areas. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

12536,"A new hybrid method for seismic fragility analysis of reinforced concrete buildings The development of accurate seismic fragility curves is a key to effective seismic risk management. This study proposes a new hybrid method to derive the seismic fragility curves of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings. In the first step, nonlinear time-history analyses are conducted to analyze the inter-story drift (ISD) ratios. Based on the analysis results, analytical fragility curves are derived for three damage states of light, moderate, and severe with varying levels of peak ground acceleration (PGA). Subsequently, empirical damage data of RC buildings collected for an actual earthquake is converted to ISD ratios using empirical equations. Lastly, based on the empirical damage data, hybrid fragility curves are derived by updating the median of the ISD ratios for a reference PGA level using Bayesian updating. In addition, to update the median values at other PGA levels including no empirical data, a new scaling factor, which is the ratio of the posterior and prior median values at the reference PGA level, is proposed. To test the proposed method, it is applied to RC buildings in Pohang city, South Korea, which were subjected to a magnitude-5.4 earthquake in 2017. From the comparison of analytical fragility curves with hybrid fragility curves, it is observed that the analytical curves overestimate the seismic vulnerability of the RC buildings, and the proposed method provides hybrid fragility curves successfully. © 2019 European Safety and Reliability Association.

13316,"Seismic damage assessment and prediction using artificial neural network of RC building considering irregularities This paper investigated multi-objective seismic damage assessment procedure. Primarily, it estimates damage index (DI) of reinforcement concrete (RC) framed low-rise residential buildings under the seismic ground motions. Three-dimensional DI has been estimated for a four-storey building by Park-Ang method considering irregularities. With increasing storey level, calculation of Park-Ang DI becomes tedious and more time consuming; therefore, this method is difficult to implement in large-scale damage evaluation. In this study, a simplified method has been proposed to estimate global DI (GDI) for regular and irregular buildings. It has been observed that ground floor experiences maximum damage where roof is experiencing least damage. Alternatively, an artificial neural network based prediction model has also been adopted in this paper to minimize the error. Factors affecting GDI of RC framed building has been narrated. To visualize the weightage of the relation between input parameters and GDI, a neural interpretation diagram has also been presented.

15764,"Assessment of one story existing precast industrial buildings in Turkey based on fragility curves In this study, seismic assessment of one story precast industrial buildings that constitute majority of industrial facilities in Turkey was investigated by using probabilistic approach. For this purpose, 98 one story precast industrial buildings that represent general structural aspects of precast industrial building stock of Turkey were used. Strength and deformation capacities of buildings were determined by inelastic methods and seismic demands were calculated by nonlinear time history analyses. In order to represent low, moderate and high intensity earthquake levels, more than 300 ground motion records were used. Fragility curves of precast buildings were then constructed by comparing the displacement capacities and seismic demands. Peak ground velocity was used as ground motion parameter to construct analytical fragility curves. Assessment of inventory buildings was performed by considering the effect of lateral strength ratio, stiffness and ductility parameters. Observations have shown that probabilities of lower damage levels (slight and moderate) are almost similar and they are independent from structural parameters considered. It was also observed that ductility and lateral strength ratios (Vt/W) have significant effect on seismic fragilities of precast industrial buildings at higher damage levels. Based on the observations, building stock was classified in three groups. Results have shown that strength and ductility based classification of existing precast industrial buildings is quite effective and it can be used as an important tool for the seismic assessment studies of one story precast industrial buildings. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

13111,"Minimal Building Flood Fragility and Loss Function Portfolio for Resilience Analysis at the Community Level Current flood vulnerability analyses rely on deterministic methods (e.g., stage-damage functions) to quantify resulting damage and losses to the built environment. While such approaches have been used extensively by communities, they do not enable the propagation of uncertainty into a risk- or resilience-informed decision process. In this paper, a method that allows the development of building fragility and building loss functions is articulated and applied to develop an archetype portfolio that can be used to model buildings in a typical community. The typical single-variable flood vulnerability function, normally based on flood depth, is extended to a multi-variate flood vulnerability function, which is a function of both flood depth and flood duration, thereby creating fragility surfaces. The portfolio presented herein consists of 15 building archetypes that can serve to populate a community-level model to predict damage and resulting functionality from a scenario flood event. The prediction of damage and functionality of buildings within a community is the first step in developing risk-informed mitigation decisions to improve community resilience. flood risk  flood damage  flood fragility  flood loss  community resilience  multi-variate analysis RISK-ASSESSMENT  RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS  DAMAGE ASSESSMENT  UNCERTAINTY  MODEL  METHODOLOGY",Minimal Building Flood Fragility and Loss Function Portfolio for Resilience Analysis at the Community Level,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,ML
20737,"Seismic fragility study for high-pressure emergency cooling water tanks of Loviisa nuclear power plant The paper studies the fragility of high-pressure emergency cooling water tanks in Loviisa Nuclear Power Plant located on the elevation +25.40 in the reactor building. The seismic fragility is defined as the conditional probability of its failure given a value of the response parameter, such as peak ground acceleration. Using the lognormal-distribution assumption, the fragility (i.e., the probability of failure, f') at any non-exceedance probability level Q can be derived as Equation 1 f' = φ[(ln(a/A) +βUφ-1 (Q))/βR] where Q = P(f &lt; f'|a) is the probability that the conditional probability f is less than f' for a peak ground acceleration a. A is the median ground acceleration capacity, βR is the logarithmic standard deviation representing the randomness about A, and βU is the logarithmic standard deviation representing the uncertainty. The quantity φ(.) is the standard Gaussian cumulative distribution function. In order to assess the fragility of the tanks the strain time histories for tank supports and piping nozzles were calculated using the joint structural-equipment model. The ground motion response spectra shape used in the structural response analysis has been taken from the YVL 2.6 - guide [1]. This shape represents the envelope spectrum for Southern Finland corresponding to the median annual frequency of 10-5. The sampling of the model properties was carried out with the aid of the Latin hypercube sampling method. In order to find the failure modes the strain time histories were calculated for the piping nozzles and for support structures of the tanks. Since strain is the best measure of energy absorption, energy limited events need to be based on the strain acceptance criteria. The adopted failure limit is the cumulated plastic strain of 8% in the tank sheet metal or in the supporting structures. This failure limit has taken from the reference [2]. The end result of the study is the presentation of the median fragility curve for the tanks as well as 95% and 5% fractile curves. © 2010 by ASME.

20652,"Seismic Fragility Assessment of Unreinforced Masonry Shear Walls The 2001 7.6 earthquake which struck the Kutch region in the western part of India was one of the largest intraplate earthquakes to have struck the Indian subcontinent. There was extensive destruction of unreinforced brick masonry (URM) buildings in the region. Assessing the vulnerability of the masonry structures of this region is complicated due to a lack of accelerograms and realistic models for the cyclic response of masonry. In this paper, synthetic accelerograms for the region are generated using the modified stochastic finite-fault method. The monotonic backbone curve is developed using a mechanics-based approach. Stress-based criteria are used to identify the displacement limit states. Experimental data of two URM shear walls are used to calibrate hysteretic models for performing nonlinear time-history analyses. Damage predictions show good comparison with the earthquake reconnaissance reports on URM damage. Seismic fragility curves indicate the high vulnerability of URM structures under the expected range of seismic intensities for the region. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

17348,"Empirical fragility curves for masonry buildings after the 2009 L'Aquila, Italy, earthquake This study focuses on the seismic vulnerability of masonry buildings damaged by the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake. A geo-referenced database of 32,520 masonry residential buildings was compiled in the aftermath of the earthquake under the coordination of the Italian Department of Civil Protection through the AeDES survey form. The availability of this enormous amount of data provides an exceptional opportunity to examine in depth damage data and their correlation with the main parameters available from the post-earthquake survey. The original database was grouped into 20 building classes, defined as a function of vertical and horizontal structural types. Damage levels defined according to the European Macroseismic Scale classification are used to derive damage probability matrices and relevant vulnerability curves for these classes. The influences of connection systems, the quality/regularity of the masonry wall layout and the horizontal structural type on the building response are analysed in detail. A vulnerability classification, also supported by the use of statistical post hoc tests, is used to detect a reduced number of independent classes. The parameters of the non-crossing fragility curves are determined via the maximum likelihood estimation method by adopting a lognormal cumulative function to determine the exceedance probabilities of the considered damage levels. The impact of mixed classes, characterized by multiple vertical and/or horizontal structural types, on the derivation of the fragility curves is also investigated. Finally, the adaptation of the general version of the fragility curves to large-scale applications based on poor (census) data is also demonstrated, leading to curves that are easily usable in regional/national seismic loss assessments.

16829,"Developing Flood Vulnerability Functions through Questionnaire Survey for Flood Risk Assessments in the Meghna Basin, Bangladesh Flood vulnerability is estimated by Flood Damage Functions (FDFs), which are crucial for integrated flood risk assessment for developing sustainable flood management, mitigation, and adaptation strategies under global change. However, the FDFs, either empirical or synthetic, are not available in Bangladesh. Therefore, this paper focused on developing the synthetic type of FDFs for agriculture and rural households through the data of a well–structured questionnaire survey conducted in two pilot sub–districts of northeastern Bangladesh in the Meghna River basin. Multiple regression analyses were performed on the collected data, and the best performing models were selected to establish FDFs. The FDF for agriculture (~196 samples) was developed concerning damage to Boro rice, whereas the FDFs for households (~165 samples) were developed concerning damage to the buildings and household property of three house types (Mud, Brick, and Concrete), separately. The results revealed that there were no yield losses when the water levels were lower than 25 cm (~rice tiller height), and the yield losses were ~100% when the water levels were 70–75 cm deep (~rice grain height). Mud houses and their household property were found the most flood–vulnerable and likely to experience total damage when the water levels exceeded 150 cm above the plinth level, whereas the damage to Brick and Concrete houses and their household property was found likely to remain partial even when the water levels exceeded 150 cm above the plinth level. The developed FDFs can be used to assess potential flood risk in the study area for sustainable and effective management of flood disasters and build back better under global change in the future. © 2022 by the authors.

15776,"Assessment of Potential Seismic Damage to Residential Unreinforced Masonry Buildings in Northern Illinois Ground acceleration estimates for northern Illinois are used to assess any damage that can occur to unreinforced masonry (URM) residential structures as a result of potential future earthquakes. These estimates are based on probable future activities in the New Madrid Seismic Zone and are published by the U.S. Geological Survey for exceedance probabilities equal to 0.10, 0.05, and 0.02 per 50 years. Accelerations corresponding to higher exceedance probabilities (1.0 and 0.25 probability in 50 years) are obtained from simplified seismic hazard analyses. Damage is estimated based on fragility curves available for URM buildings. The probability of damage is then used along with the inventory of buildings to arrive at estimates of the percentage and the number of buildings that may suffer damage of various levels (ranging from nonstructural damage to total collapse). The study shows that considering p = 1 exceedance probability in 50 years (i.e., a 50 year return period), the maximum acceleration for the area will be about 0.017g. This acceleration causes slight damage to about 1% of buildings and nonstructural damage to about 4% of them. With an acceleration of 0.057g, about 1% of URM buildings will experience severe damage, 5% moderate damage, 17% slight damage, and 53% nonstructural damage.

20616,"Seismic fragility assessment of a tall reinforced concrete chimney In China, a considerable proportion of reinforced concrete (RC) industrial chimneys in operation was designed and constructed in accordance with less rigorous outdated seismic criteria during the end of 19th and early 20th century. However, few research works have been reported till date on a realistic overall assessment of the seismic performance of these existing aging RC chimney structures. Therefore, in this study, fragilities of existing RC chimney were studied. For this purpose, an existing 240m tall RC chimney was selected and structurally modeled with a lumped mass beam (stick) model by means of the OpenSees analysis program. In order to capture the uncertainties in ground motion realizations, a series of 21 ground motions are selected from the Next Generation Attenuation database as the input motions. To develop the analytical fragility curves, nonlinear incremental dynamic analysis of the studied RC chimney was then carried out using the selected input motions, which were normalized to different excitation levels. The section curvature ductility ratio was considered as the damage index. Based on material strain and sectional analysis, four limit states (LSs) were defined for five damage state. The seismic responses of the all sections were utilized to evaluate the likelihood of exceeding the LSs. Then the peak ground acceleration (PGA)-based seismic fragility curves of the structure were constructed assuming a lognormal distribution. Finally, under the light of these fragility curves, the damage risks in existing RC chimney were discussed. The analytical results indicated that for design level earthquake of PGA=0.1g (g is the gravitational acceleration) and the maximum considered earthquake of PGA=0.22g, the probabilities of exceeding the light damage state were around 1.5% and 44%, respectively, while the exceedance probabilities corresponding to moderate, extensive and complete damage states were approximately zero in both cases. On the other hand, fragility analysis revealed that the RC chimney structure had considerable ductility capacity and was capable to withstand a strong earthquake with some structural damages.

21236,"Seismic Vulnerability of Low- and Mid-Rise Reinforced Concrete Buildings in Malaysia Designed by Considering Only Gravity Loads This study focuses on seismic vulnerability assessment of reinforced concrete buildings designed by considering only gravity loads. Fragility curves are developed for a three-story reinforced concrete office frame building and a four-story reinforced concrete school building with unreinforced masonry infill walls representative of the essential facilities in Malaysian Peninsula. A simplified modeling approach is adopted for fragility analysis, which can effectively reduce the computational effort. A set of fragility curves are developed in terms of peak ground acceleration with lognormal cumulative distribution functions. The fragility analysis shows that the seismic performance of the structures met the desirable performance level recommended by current seismic code, demonstrating low vulnerability of the structures within Malaysian Peninsula. It is also shown that the soil condition should be taken into consideration for effective seismic vulnerability assessment.

Damage to the facades of these buildings was a clear contributor to overall building damage. This paper presents the damage assessment of the facade systems of these RC buildings. A survey of 173 RC buildings in the Christchurch CBD is conducted here, focusing on the damage to the facade systems of the buildings. The survey covers only buildings greater than three storeys in height, excluding the majority of unreinforced masonry facades, the damage to which has been well documented. The facade type and modularity is classified for each system, as well as the connection type where possible. The level of damage to each facade is determined in terms of the following performance levels: Operational, Immediate Occupancy, Life Safety and High Hazard. Further investigation is also made into three precast concrete panel systems.

17441,"Estimation of economic seismic loss of steel moment-frame buildings using a machine learning algorithm In this study, the effect of modeling-related uncertainties on the expected annual losses of modern code-compliant steel moment-frame buildings is analyzed. Probabilistic structural models are initially employed to account for all the critical sources of uncertainty. Then, these structural models are used to develop machine-learning-based prediction models to estimate the expected annual losses and the associated economic contributors; the developed machine-learning-based prediction models exhibit an excellent performance in the prediction of the economic seismic losses of steel frame buildings. The effect of structural-modeling-related uncertainties on each loss contributor is also evaluated; the effect of uncertain modeling parameters is observed to be more pronounced on loss contributors such as demolition and structural collapse losses that are controlled primarily by ground motions with a low probability of earthquake occurrence.

15942,"Bootstrapped Artificial Neural Networks for the seismic analysis of structural systems We look at the behavior of structural systems under the occurrence of seismic events with the aim of identifying the fragility curves. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) empirical regression models are employed as fast-running surrogates of the (long-running) Finite Element Models (FEMs) that are typically adopted for the simulation of the system structural response. However, the use of regression models in safety critical applications raises concerns with regards to accuracy and precision. For this reason, we use the bootstrap method to quantify the uncertainty introduced by the ANN metamodel. An application is provided with respect to the evaluation of the structural damage (in this case, the maximal top displacement) of a masonry building subject to seismic risk. A family of structure fragility curves is identified, that accounts for both the (epistemic) uncertainty due to the use of ANN metamodels and the (epistemic) uncertainty due to the paucity of data available to infer the fragility parameters. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd Artificial Neural Network  Bootstrap  Confidence intervals  Epistemic uncertainty  Fragility curve  Seismic risk  Structure Neural networks  Regression analysis  Safety engineering  Seismology  Statistical methods  Structural analysis  Structure (composition)  Uncertainty analysis  Bootstrap  Confidence interval  Epistemic uncertainties  Fragility curves  Seismic risk  Finite element method",Bootstrapped Artificial Neural Networks for the seismic analysis of structural systems,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012640182604572411,0.024868561382406326,0.00889042683676743,0.9812205336663945,ML
16772,"Derivation of vulnerability functions for European-type RC structures based on observational data In this paper existing vulnerability relationships for reinforced concrete structures are reviewed with a view to their application to a European (and similar) seismic risk assessment scenario. New empirical fragility curves for reinforced concrete building populations are derived based on a data bank of 99 post-earthquake damage distributions observed in 19 earthquakes and concerning a total of 340 000 RC structures. The heterogeneous observational data are reinterpreted in terms of a new damage scale: Homogenised reinforced concrete (HRC-scale), which is calibrated experimentally and allows a distinction to be made between the seismic resistances of different structural systems. The feasibility of using observation-based data for the generation of vulnerability curves for different strong ground motion parameters is investigated. The notion of developing a set of 'homogeneous' vulnerability relationships, applicable to different lateral-load resisting systems is explored and a series of relationships for different building height and age-classes are proposed. Large uncertainties are associated with the empirical relationships due to the nature and scarcity of observational data. The role of combined observation-testing-analysis as the basis for deriving reliable vulnerability formulations is thus emphasised. Notwithstanding, the statistics of the new vulnerability functions are a significant improvement over existing observation-based curves for European RC structures. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

12526,"A generic physical vulnerability model for floods: Review and concept for data-scarce regions The use of different methods for physical flood vulnerability assessment has evolved over time, from traditional single-parameter stage-damage curves to multi-parameter approaches such as multivariate or indicator-based models. However, despite the extensive implementation of these models in flood risk assessment globally, a considerable gap remains in their applicability to data-scarce regions. Considering that these regions are mostly areas with a limited capacity to cope with disasters, there is an essential need for assessing the physical vulnerability of the built environment and contributing to an improvement of flood risk reduction. To close this gap, we propose linking approaches with reduced data requirements, such as vulnerability indicators (integrating major damage drivers) and damage grades (integrating frequently observed damage patterns). First, we present a review of current studies of physical vulnerability indicators and flood damage models comprised of stage-damage curves and the multivariate methods that have been applied to predict damage grades. Second, we propose a new conceptual framework for assessing the physical vulnerability of buildings exposed to flood hazards that has been specifically tailored for use in data-scarce regions. This framework is operationalized in three steps: (i) developing a vulnerability index, (ii) identifying regional damage grades, and (iii) linking resulting index classes with damage patterns, utilizing a synthetic ""what-if""analysis. The new framework is a first step for enhancing flood damage prediction to support risk reduction in data-scarce regions. It addresses selected gaps in the literature by extending the application of the vulnerability index for damage grade prediction through the use of a synthetic multi-parameter approach. The framework can be adapted to different data-scarce regions and allows for integrating possible modifications to damage drivers and damage grades. © 2020 Author(s).

18583,"Intensity-based seismic risk assessment Recent experience suggests that the bulk of modern studies of seismic hazard have sought to express ground motion in terms of physical parameters such as peak ground acceleration, spectral acceleration, and so on. The correlation of physical ground motion parameters with actual levels of damage has proved a difficult subject of study. No single ground motion parameter (such as peak ground acceleration) provides an ideal analogue of damage. However, the problems can be bypassed by using earthquake intensity in place of physical ground motion parameters. Intensity relates specifically to damage in a way that parameters like peak ground acceleration do not. The passage from hazard to risk is still problematic using older intensity scales, but since the MSK and the EMS-98 (European Macroseismic Scale) intensity scales directly express the probabilistic nature of damage distributions for any intensity degree, the task is greatly simplified. An equation that expresses the attenuation of EMS intensities is a description of the extent to which damage patterns to different building types vary as a function of magnitude and distance. Such an equation is based directly on past observations of damage, and so it is only natural to expect it to do a reasonable job of predicting future levels of damage. Risk curves can be prepared that show the probability of different grades of damage being suffered by buildings of different types.

19901,"Rainstorm waterlogging risk assessment in central urban area of Shanghai based on multiple scenario simulation With the acceleration of the urbanization process, waterlogging problems in coastal cities are becoming more and more serious due to climate change. However, up until now, the common procedures and programs for rainstorm waterlogging risk assessment in coastal cities still have not formed. Considering a series of impact factors of rainstorm waterlogging in coastal city, the present study established a paradigm for rainstorm waterlogging risk assessment through the combination of hydrological modeling and GIS spatial analysis, and took the residence in central urban area of Shanghai as an example. First, the simplified urban waterlogging model was applied to simulate the depth and extent of rainstorm waterlogging under six hypothetic scenarios. Second, the residence exposed to rainstorm waterlogging was extracted and analyzed supported by spatial analysis module of ArcGIS. Then, stage-damage curves were applied to analyze the loss rate of structure and contents of residential building. Finally, the waterlogging loss maps of residence in different scenarios, the annual average loss, and the risk curve were taken as the expression of waterlogging risk. The results show that the inundated water depth, vulnerability, and losses of residence all increase as the intensity of rainstorm increases. The old-style residence is most vulnerable to rainstorm waterlogging, followed by the new-style residence, and villa is less vulnerable to rainstorm waterlogging. The annual average loss of residence in Shanghai central urban area was about CNY 22.25 million. The results also indicate high risk in Yangpu and Putuo districts, Xuhui, Hongkou, Changning and Zhabei districts come under medium-risk zone, and Jing'an, Luwan and Huangpu districts come under low-risk zone.

15323,"A real-world application of Monte Carlo procedure for debris flow risk assessment A method for formal risk analysis in debris flow-prone areas is proposed. In this paper risk is defined as the mean annual probability for buildings located in hazardous areas to be damaged by a debris flow. As is well known, specific risk assessment involves the evaluation of both hazard and vulnerability. To quantify debris flow hazard, a Monte Carlo procedure is applied that randomly selects the input variables of mathematical models simulating triggering, propagation and stoppage of debris flows. This allows to estimate the probability density function of the output variables characterizing the destructive power of debris flow (for instance total force, sum of hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces) at each point of the alluvial fan. Three different vulnerability functions are adopted: two of them are derived from assessments of different types of natural risk, such as snow avalanches and flood waves. The third vulnerability function is obtained from structural analysis of buildings damaged during a mudflow that occurred in Sarno, Italy.

16331,"Computing seismic fragility curves using polynomial chaos expansions Fragility curves are commonly used in civil engineering to estimate the vulnerability of structures to earthquakes. The probability of failure associated with a failure criterion (e.g. the maximal inter-storey drift being greater than a prescribed threshold) is represented as a function of the intensity of the earthquake (e.g. peak ground acceleration or spectral acceleration). Computing fragility curves relies upon running a large number of transient dynamic (possibly non linear) analyses using a set of synthetic or measured ground motions. In this paper we introduce sparse polynomial chaos expansions as a way to reduce the associated computational burden. Non stationary synthetic ground motions are generated using a method recently proposed by Rezaeian & Der Kiureghian, which is based on modulating a filtered Gaussian white noise process. Sparse PC expansions of the structural response are computed from a relatively small (e.g. 1, 000) set of accelerograms and post-processed in order to evaluate the fragility curves. The approach is compared to the classical curves derived under the assumption of log-normality. For linear structures the lognormal assumption is validated by our calculations and the classical approach is improved using some analytical derivations. The various approaches are illustrated on a typical 3-storey building using the finite element software OpenSees. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

15699,"Are flood damage models converging to reality? Lessons learnt from a blind test Effective flood risk management requires a realistic estimation of flood losses. However, available flood damage estimates are still characterized by significant levels of uncertainty, questioning the capacity of flood damage models to depict real damages. With a joint effort of eight international research groups, the objective of this study was to compare, in a blind-validation test, the performances of different models for the assessment of the direct flood damage to the residential sector at the building level (i.e. microscale). The test consisted of a common flood case study characterized by high availability of hazard and building data but with undisclosed information on observed losses in the implementation stage of the models. The nine selected models were chosen in order to guarantee a good mastery of the models by the research teams, variety of the modelling approaches, and heterogeneity of the original calibration context in relation to both hazard and vulnerability features. By avoiding possible biases in model implementation, this blind comparison provided more objective insights on the transferability of the models and on the reliability of their estimations, especially regarding the potentials of local and multivariable models. From another perspective, the exercise allowed us to increase awareness of strengths and limits of flood damage modelling, which are summarized in the paper in the form of take-home messages from a modeller's perspective.

21162,"Seismic Vulnerability Assessment of Hybrid Steel-Timber Structure: Steel Moment-Resisting Frames with CLT Infill In this article, seismic vulnerability assessment is carried-out on a novel hybrid structure (steel moment resisting frame (SMRF) and cross laminated timber (CLT) infill panels). For the seismicity of Vancouver, Canada, a three-bay, 3-, 6-, and 9-story height SMRFs are designed for two ductility levels (ductile and limited ductility). To study the seismic vulnerability CLT infilled building, parametric analysis was performed by varying infill configuration (bare frame, one-bay infilled, two-bay infilled, and fully infilled). The structure is modeled in OpenSees and nonlinear dynamic analysis is performed. Peak inter-story drift demand and corresponding FEMA performance limits (capacity) values are used to compute the corresponding fragility curves. From the analyses, it can be seen that as more bays are infilled, the fundamental period and seismic vulnerability is reduced significantly. The results highlight that, within the performance-based earthquake engineering, different objectives can be met with varying the CLT configuration.

Specifically, the purpose of pushover analysis is twofold: to identify which pile of the PSWS most likely suffers from seismic failure; and to determine the bound limits of seismic demands for estimation of fragility curves using the identified pile. A collection of ground motions with low and high moment magnitudes as well as small and large fault distances are selected for nonlinear time history analysis. The seismic demand models can be readily estimated from the data set of the intensity measure-seismic demand pairs by classical regression fitting. A comparison of fragility curves with and without SPI shows that SPI significantly influences the seismic fragility of the PSWS. For distinct damage states, the effect of SPI on the seismic fragilities of different piles can be totally different.

21295,"Sensitivity of the Fragility Curve on Type of Analysis Methods, Applied Ground Motions and Their Selection Techniques Fragility curves are the primary way of assessing seismic risk for a building with numerous studies focused on deriving these fragility curves and how to account for the inherent uncertainty in the seismic assessment. This study focuses on a three-story steel moment frame structure and performs a fragility assessment of the building using a new approach called SPO2FRAG (Static Pushover to Fragility) that is based on pushover analysis. This new approach is further compared and contrasted against traditional nonlinear dynamic analysis approaches like Incremental Dynamic Analysis and Multiple Stripe Analysis. The sensitivity of the resulting fragility curves is studied against multiple parameters including uncertainties in ground motion, the type of analysis method used and the choice of curve fitting technique. All these factors influence the fragility curve behavior and this study assesses the impact of changing these parameters. © 2021, The Author(s).

17072,"Earthquake damage assessment of 1-story precast industrial buildings using damage probability matrices In this study, risk assessment of 1-story precast building is conducted in probabilistic manner by using damage probability matrices (DPMs). Peak ground velocity (PGV) is used as reference ground motion parameter to associate with structural damages and more than three hundred real earthquake records is used for nonlinear dynamic analysis of precast buildings. Three different probabilistic calculation approaches mainly based on analytical methods have been used to obtain DPMs and utilized methods are compared. Comparisons have shown that analytical methods presented herein can be used to describe the upper and lower bound of damage probabilities of precast buildings, respectively. Evaluations on the damage probabilities have also pointed out that the structural differences among the buildings, use of different probabilistic approaches and damage ratios related with structural damage costs cause remarkable differences between the damage predictions and they can be considered as primary sources of uncertainties. Logic tree method, which has ability to gather involved uncertainties, is used to carry out reliable damage assessment. Results have shown that damage ratios of precast buildings determined after logic tree analysis have a good agreement with site investigation studies of 1999 Kocaeli earthquake occurred in Turkey and presented methods can be used in risk assessment of precast industrial buildings. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

12963,"Fragility curves and loss estimation for traditional timber-framed masonry buildings in Lefkas, Greece The 2003 earthquake in the Greek island of Lefkas, has revived the interest for the local anti-seismic technique based on the use of timber-framed masonry, whose adequate performance during the earthquake revealed the merits of this rather sophisticated, albeit traditional, construction. A key feature of the Lefkas structures is their dual structural system. The secondary system is activated once the ground storey stone masonry piers of the primary system (which includes timber-framed masonry in all storeys) fail. In this regard, two different structural models are presented herein to simulate the response of each system. A macro-model based on nonlinear (NL) strut elements and point plastic hinges is intended to model the timber-framed masonry. NL analyses are carried out for one, two and three storey buildings, which represent the most common cases in Lefkas. Furthermore, an investigation is carried out regarding the foundation of the buildings resting on soft alluvial deposits. Pushover curves are derived from the NL analyses of the buildings and are then converted to capacity curves using the characteristics of the predominant mode. On these curves four damage states (slight damage, moderate damage, heavy damage, and collapse) are defined on the basis of criteria related to the actual response of the building. Then, fragility curves in terms of spectral displacement are generated, adopting a log-normal statistical distribution. These curves are converted into PGA values using a selected response spectrum. Utilising these fragility curves a seismic loss scenario for the 2003 Lefkas earthquake is developed for the timber-framed masonry stock of Lefkas city. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

20601,"Seismic fragility analysis with artificial neural networks: Application to nuclear power plant equipment The fragility curve is defined as the conditional probability of failure of a structure, or its critical components, at given values of seismic intensity measures (IMs). The conditional probability of failure is usually computed adopting a log-normal assumption to reduce the computational cost. In this paper, an artificial neural network (ANN) is constructed to improve the computational efficiency for the calculation of structural outputs. The following aspects are addressed in this paper: (a) Implementation of an efficient algorithm to select IMs as inputs of the ANN. The most relevant IMs are selected with a forward selection approach based on semi-partial correlation coefficients; (b) quantification and investigation of the ANN prediction uncertainty computed with the delta method. It consists of an aleatory component from the simplification of the seismic inputs and an epistemic model uncertainty from the limited size of the training data. The aleatory component is integrated in the computation of fragility curves, whereas the epistemic component provides the confidence intervals; (c) computation of fragility curves with Monte Carlo method and verification of the validity of the log-normal assumption.

20161,"Risk and fragility assessment of residential wooden buildings subject to hurricane winds Hurricanes are one of the major causes of damage and loss to residential wooden buildings in the United States. The study of hurricane-imposed risks to residential wooden buildings is, therefore, a fundamental step to mitigate these damages and losses. Within this context, a probabilistic methodology is provided for the fragility analysis of residential wooden buildings. Two damage mechanisms are considered in this methodology, excessive dynamic wind pressure and impact from windborne debris. Unlike existing frameworks, the methodology defines the geometric configuration as well as the required extension of the neighboring buildings to estimate the damage from both mechanisms. A case study illustrates the methodology on residential communities composed of archetype gable-roof buildings. Ten construction cases are defined to cover a range of resistances of building components for both considered damage mechanisms. Three floor-area ratios (FAR) are also considered. The resulting fragility curves highlight: (1) the effect of the FAR on enhancing the performance of residential buildings due to the effect of shielding; and (2) the significance of windborne debris in increasing the estimated hurricane risk. The estimated fragility curves can be used to directly model residential buildings in community resilience frameworks. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd Fragility analysis  Performance assessment  Residential-wooden buildings  Risk assessment  Vulnerability models  Windborne debris damage Debris  Hurricanes  Risk assessment  Risk perception  Structural dynamics  Wind effects  Wooden buildings  Community resiliences  Fragility analysis  Fragility assessment  Geometric configurations  Neighboring building  Probabilistic methodology  Residential building  Residential communities  Housing",Risk and fragility assessment of residential wooden buildings subject to hurricane winds,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4624216057667747,0.021784589229427907,0.045965002052358164,0.05209641148452793,Analytical
16842,"Developing tsunami fragility curves from the surveyed data of the 2011 great east Japan tsunami in Sendai and Ishinomaki plains Japan was hit by the tsunami generated by the greatest earthquake in the history of Japan. The authors conducted the post-tsunami field survey in Miyagi prefecture immediately after the event to measure the inundation depth and investigate damaged buildings. Most of the buildings surveyed were wooden houses and could be classified into 4 damage levels. The primary data of inundation depth and damage levels obtained from the field survey were used to create the tsunami fragility curves, which described the degree of structural damage as a function of the hydrodynamic characteristics of tsunami inundation. The developed fragility curves show that damage with more than a 50% chance of occurring is classified as minor damage, moderate damage, major damage and complete damage when the tsunami inundation depth is between 2.53.0 m, 3.04.0 m and 4.04.5 m and greater than 4.5 m, respectively. By comparing the developed tsunami fragility curves, wooden houses in the studied area have higher structural performance than those obtained from historical events in other areas. The new curves suggest that wooden houses will be severely damaged if the inundation depth is greater than 3 m and collapse if the depth is greater than 4 m while wooden houses from historical data can resist only 12 m. Moreover, wooden walls in Japan reduce the overall failure of a structural member because a wooden wall is easier to destroy (compared to brick walls in Thailand and Indonesia) and allows the tsunami to pass through, which reduces the pressure at the attacking front of the tsunami. The fragility curves are very important for the loss estimation and reconstruction plans of the city; they are also crucial for reducing the disaster damage from a future tsunami. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company and Japan Society of Civil Engineers. field survey  The 2011 Great East Japan tsunami  tsunami fragility curve Floods  Houses  Structural analysis  Surveys  Walls (structural partitions)  Field surveys  Fragility curves  Historical data  Hydrodynamic characteristics  Loss estimation  Structural damages  Structural performance  Tsunami inundation  Tsunamis",Developing tsunami fragility curves from the surveyed data of the 2011 great east Japan tsunami in Sendai and Ishinomaki plains,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33939665347409775,0.3652707187533865,0.007211947919705786,0.0028125907009644716,Empirical
16124,"Chapter 22 - NDSHA-based vulnerability evaluation of precode buildings in Republic of North Macedonia: novel experiences This chapter provides a methodology for seismic vulnerability evaluation of existing precode structures, using a multidisciplinary approach that connects the region – specific topologies of masonry buildings on one hand, and site – specific response spectra on the other. The proposed procedure is applied to a chosen structure topology as a case study: a school building in the City of Ohrid, North Macedonia. Reliable Seismic Hazard Assessment for a selected region is one of the key points for performing seismic risk analysis, a scenario – based Neo Deterministic approach (NDSHA) is used for calculation of the response spectra. For the comparison of the final results, apart from calculated site-specific response spectra, EC-defined spectra have been utilized as seismic input, too. Capacity of the building has been determined by multiple execution of nonlinear static analysis, taking into consideration the uncertainties of input parameters. As a result, region-specific vulnerability and reliability curves that relate the peak ground acceleration (PGA) values to the probability of exceedance of a certain damage state have been presented. The results highlight the advantage of using site - specific NDSHA response spectra as seismic input, as the damage reports from earthquakes that stroked Ohrid in 2017 have confirmed the merits of the applied approach.

15494,"An assessment of seismic hazard and risk in the islands of Cephalonia and Ithaca, Greece The region of the islands of Cephalonia and Ithaca, Western Greece, is characterized by continuous seismic activity and frequent occurrence of large magnitude earthquakes, which have resulted many times in the past in severe structural destruction and large human and economic losses. This work represents an effort to assess seismic hazard and risk in these two islands. Due to the scarcity of seismic data in the region, artificial accelerograms are generated on the basis of the specific barrier model in order to provide estimates of strong ground motion. Peak ground accelerations of the artificial accelerograms are compared with those coming from an empirically derived ground motion prediction model. The response spectra of the artificial accelerograms are compared with the design spectrum of the Greek seismic code and the seismic damage potential of old and new building structures is assessed and found to be high. From the present study it is concluded that there is a need of monitoring continuously the seismic activity in the region. Thus, the establishment of a dense and time continuous strong ground motion recording network is proposed and briefly described.

19723,"Probabilistic evaluation of observed earthquake damage data in Turkey Empirical, theoretical or hybrid methods can be used for the vulnerability analysis of structures to evaluate the seismic damage data and to obtain probability damage matrices. The information on observed structural damage after earthquakes has critical importance to drive empirical vulnerability methods. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the damage distributions based on the data observed in Erzincan-1992, Dinar-1995 and Kocaeli-1999 earthquakes in Turkey utilizing two probability models-Modified Binomial Distribution (MBiD) and Modified Beta Distribution (MBeD). Based on these analyses, it was possible (a) to compare the advantages and limitations of the two probability models with respect to their capabilities in modelling the observed damage distributions; (b) to evaluate the damage assessment for reinforced concrete and masonry buildings in Turkey based on these models; (c) to model the damage distribution of different sub-groups such as buildings with different number of storeys or soil conditions according to the both models. The results indicate that (a) MBeD is more suitable than the MBiD to model the observed damage data for both reinforced concrete and masonry buildings in Turkey; (b) the sub-groups with lower number of stories are located in the lower intensity levels, while the sub-groups with higher number of stories depending on local site condition are concentrated in the higher intensity levels, thus site conditions should also be considered in the assessment of the intensity levels; (c) the detailed local models decrease the uncertainties of loss estimation since the damage distribution of sub-groups can be more accurately modelled compared to the general damage distribution models. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.

20951,"Seismic response and torsional effects of RC structure with irregular plant and variations in diaphragms, designed with Venezuelan codes The objective of this study is to determine the seismic response and torsional effects of an existing Reinforced Concrete building with irregular plant and five levels projected according to an older version of Venezuelan seismic design code. Two structures were analysed: the original building and a redesigned version. Nonlinear static analysis and nonlinear 3D dynamic analysis were applied, based on registers of three synthetic accelerograms compatible with the elastic design spectrum for the used code. In 3D analysis, four structures were simulated, with and without rigid diaphragms so as to compare the seismic behaviour of the buildings. Through this nonlinear analysis parameters were determined that define the behaviour of the structure, torsional moments and rotations in columns reached for simulated buildings. Also, to obtain damage fragility curves for five states damage were generated. Results show that the original structure has an inadequate resistant behaviour and a high probability of exceeding the moderate damage state, while the redesigned structure presents good performance under seismic events according to the existing code. It was also observed that maximum torsional effects occur in the entrant corners of the irregular plant, which are reduced in mid-rise buildings by using a rigid diaphragm. © 2013 WIT Press.

21404,"Simulative earthquake damage modeling based on EMS-98-reliability and predictability Simulative earthquake damage modeling based on EMS-98 - reliability and predictability Internationally, various damage models exist to quantify the structural damage to the structure and the resulting losses due to seismic action. The application of the different types of damage functions for a realistic assessment of damage requires a detailed knowledge of the structure and its vulnerability and site-specific conditions. The intensity-based damage model for general building stock, developed at the Earthquake Damage Analysis Center of the Bauhaus-Universitat Weimar within the framework of the German Research Network Natural Disasters (DFNK), was validated on the mean damage grades D-m and the reported losses of the 1978 Albstadt earthquake. A consideration of the spreads and uncertainties in the distribution of damage grades D-i as well as the mirroring of comparable damage models was still pending. The validation and evaluation of the investigated model approaches is carried out in the paper on the basis of the distribution of the actually occurred structural damages of the seismic events characterized by different site intensities (e.g. Albstadt 1978, L'Aquila 2009). Looking back at the study of DFNK, the results for the metropolitan area of Cologne will be examined again with new building data and the extended damage model. The building vulnerability, aggregated in the DFNK, is transferred to the individual building stock and the influence on the earthquake scenarios is examined. The scatter of structural damage and losses are taken into account by Monte Carlo simulations.

15999,"Building Damage Assessment Using Scenario Based Tsunami Numerical Analysis and Fragility Curves A combination of a deterministic approach and fragility analysis is applied to assess tsunami damage caused to buildings. The area selected to validate the model is Imwon Port in Korea. The deterministic approach includes numerical modeling of tsunami propagation in the East Sea following an earthquake on the western coast of Japan. The model is based on the linear shallow-water equations (LSWE) augmented with Boussinesq approximation to account for dispersion effects in wave propagation, and coastal wave run-up is modeled by non-linear shallow-water equations (NLSWE). The output from the deterministic model comprises inundation depth. The numerical output is used to perform fragility analysis for buildings vulnerable to flooding by tsunamis in the port area. Recently developed fragility curves-based on the ordinal regression method-are used for damage probability estimates. The extent of structural damage in the areas under a tsunami hazard is identified by the numerical modeling of tsunami features. Our numerical model offers high bathymetric resolution, which enables us to capture flow features at the individual structure level and results in improved estimation of damage probability. This approach can serve as a measure of assessing structure vulnerability for areas with little or no records of tsunami damage and provide planners with a better understanding of structure behavior when a tsunami strikes. tsunami hazard  tsunami modeling  fragility analysis  inundation depths  structures  floods RUN-UP  VULNERABILITY FUNCTIONS  SIMULATION  IMPACT  MODEL",Building Damage Assessment Using Scenario Based Tsunami Numerical Analysis and Fragility Curves,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10352162251701516,0.020959200998404103,0.9755750056738112,0.010222441638345825,Hybrid
16694,"Damage states of yielding and collapse for elevated water tanks supported on RC frame staging Elevated water tanks are inverted pendulum type structures where drift limit is an important criterion for seismic design and performance evaluation. Explicit drift criteria for elevated water tanks are not available in the literature. In this study, probabilistic approach is used to determine maximum drift limit for damage state of yielding and damage state of collapse for the elevated water tanks supported on RC frame staging. The two damage states are defined using results of incremental dynamic analysis wherein a total of 2160 nonlinear time history analyses are performed using twelve artificial spectrum compatible ground motions. Analytical fragility curves are developed using two-parameter lognormal distribution. The maximum allowable drifts corresponding to yield and collapse level requirements are estimated for different tank capacities. Finally, a single fragility curve is developed which provides maximum drift values for the different probability of damage. Further, for rational consideration of the uncertainties in design, three confidence levels are selected and corresponding drift limits for damage states of yielding and collapse are proposed. These values of maximum drift can be used in performance-based seismic design for a particular damage state depending on the level of confidence. incremental dynamic analysis  fragility analysis  elevated water tanks  drift limits  frame staging SOIL-STRUCTURE INTERACTION  LIQUID STORAGE TANKS  REINFORCED-CONCRETE PEDESTAL  RESPONSE MODIFICATION FACTOR  SEISMIC FRAGILITY ANALYSIS  NATURAL PERIOD  HIGHRISE BUILDINGS  DYNAMIC-BEHAVIOR  EARTHQUAKE  PERFORMANCE",Damage states of yielding and collapse for elevated water tanks supported on RC frame staging,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3549236056041917,0.003953232844265111,0.02868438800729177,0.040086441647507756,Analytical
22188,"Vector-valued fragility functions for seismic risk evaluation This article presents a method for the development of vector-valued fragility functions, which are a function of more than one intensity measure (IM, also known as ground-motion parameters) for use within seismic risk evaluation of buildings. As an example, a simple unreinforced masonry structure is modelled using state-of-the-art software and hundreds of nonlinear time-history analyses are conducted to compute the response of this structure to earthquake loading. Dozens of different IMs (e. g. peak ground acceleration and velocity, response spectral accelerations at various periods, Arias intensity and various duration and number of cycle measures) are considered to characterize the earthquake shaking. It is demonstrated through various statistical techniques (including Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis) that the use of more than one IM leads to a better prediction of the damage state of the building than just a single IM, which is the current practice. In addition, it is shown that the assumption of the lognormal distribution for the derivation of fragility functions leads to more robust functions than logistic, log-logistic or kernel regression. Finally, actual fragility surfaces using two pairs of IMs (one pair are uncorrelated while the other are correlated) are derived and compared to scalar-based fragility curves using only a single IM and a significant reduction in the uncertainty of the predicted damage level is observed. This type of fragility surface would be a key component of future risk evaluations that take account of recent developments in seismic hazard assessment, such as vector-valued probabilistic seismic hazard assessments. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

19060,"Multi-variate flood damage assessment: A tree-based data-mining approach The usual approach for flood damage assessment consists of stage-damage functions which relate the relative or absolute damage for a certain class of objects to the inundation depth. Other characteristics of the flooding situation and of the flooded object are rarely taken into account, although flood damage is influenced by a variety of factors. We apply a group of data-mining techniques, known as tree-structured models, to flood damage assessment. A very comprehensive data set of more than 1000 records of direct building damage of private households in Germany is used. Each record contains details about a large variety of potential damage-influencing characteristics, such as hydrological and hydraulic aspects of the flooding situation, early warning and emergency measures undertaken, state of precaution of the household, building characteristics and socio-economic status of the household. Regression trees and bagging decision trees are used to select the more important damage-influencing variables and to derive multi-variate flood damage models. It is shown that these models outperform existing models, and that tree-structured models are a promising alternative to traditional damage models. © Author(s) 2013.

Therefore, assessing its effects on structural performance has become a fundamental issue in seismic engineering.

In order to reproduce the nonlinear cyclic behavior (dilation tendency and the increase in cyclic shear strength) due to liquefaction, nonlinear hysteretic materials and advanced plasticity models were applied.

18374,"IMPLICATIONS OF CUMULATED SEISMIC DAMAGE ON THE SEISMIC PERFORMANCE OF UNREINFORCED MASONRY BUILDINGS The seismic capacity of a structure is a function of the characteristics of the system as well as of its state, which is mainly affected by previous damage and deterioration. The cumulative damage from repeated shocks (for example during a seismic sequence or due to multiple events affecting an unrepaired building stock) affects the vulnerability of masonry buildings for subsequent events. This paper proposes an analytical methodology for the derivation of state-dependent fragility curves, taking into account cumulated seismic damage, whilst neglecting possible ageing effects. The methodology is based on nonlinear dynamic analyses of an equivalent single degree of freedom system, properly calibrated to reproduce the static and dynamic behaviour of the structure. An application of the proposed methodology to an unreinforced masonry case study building is also presented. The effect of cumulated damage on the seismic response of this prototype masonry building is further studied by means of nonlinear dynamic analyses with the accelerograms recorded during a real earthquake sequence that occurred in Canterbury (New Zealand) between 2010 and 2012.

19547,"Post-disaster damage assessment of structures by neural networks Recent papers have investigated the contribution of structural and secondary elements in the overall damage of structures due to seismic effects. The present paper improves such methods by investigating also the marginal contribution of the geotechnical disorders and geometric regularity, in addition to the combined effect of structural and secondary elements. An adapted artificial neural networks (ANNs) method is proposed for this purpose. In this approach, three groups of parameters are considered for the quantitative evaluation of post-earthquake damage of structures: the structural group, the secondary group and a qualitatively evaluated group consisting observed geotechnical disorders and building regularity. Principal-component analysis is used in order to evaluate the effects of each input variable on the global structural damage. The ANN model is trained and validated for a collected database corresponding to 27,601 of buildings (Boumerdes earthquake, Algeria: M=6.8; May 21, 2003) and tested for 1,000 damaged buildings, located near the hypocentral zone (Bordj-El Bahri city, near Algiers), inspected during a post-quake damage survey. The assessment of the overall damage of structures based on the whole combination of three groups indicates that the developed model provides more accurate theoretical global damage predictions (98% accordance) that render it a promising tool for the inspector to decide about the final damage category. © 2021 Techno-Press, Ltd. damages  earthquake  geotechnical disorders  neural network  post-disaster  structures Damage detection  Disasters  Earthquakes  Principal component analysis  Structural analysis  Damage  Damage assessments  Damage of structures  Earthquake  Geotechnical  Geotechnical disorder  Marginal contribution  Neural-networks  Post disasters  Seismic effect  Neural networks",Post-disaster damage assessment of structures by neural networks,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01308210497188988,0.02553919415740392,0.0045028352852903054,0.8438884037928744,ML
18546,"INSYDE: a synthetic, probabilistic flood damage model based on explicit cost analysis Methodologies to estimate economic flood damages are increasingly important for flood risk assessment and management. In this work, we present a new synthetic flood damage model based on a component-by-component analysis of physical damage to buildings. The damage functions are designed using an expert-based approach with the support of existing scientific and technical literature, loss adjustment studies, and damage surveys carried out for past flood events in Italy. The model structure is designed to be transparent and flexible, and therefore it can be applied in different geographical contexts and adapted to the actual knowledge of hazard and vulnerability variables. The model has been tested in a recent flood event in northern Italy. Validation results provided good estimates of postevent damages, with similar or superior performances when compared with other damage models available in the literature. In addition, a local sensitivity analysis was performed in order to identify the hazard variables that have more influence on damage assessment results.

21359,Simplified drift-based fragility assessment of confined masonry buildings This paper presents a simplified methodology for developing drift-based fragility curves for confined masonry (CM) buildings in seismic zones. Drift-based fragilities are derived from a stiffness-and-strength equivalent single-degree-offreedom system subjected to a set of earthquake ground motions scaled to reach peak displacement demands associated to key damage states observed in CM buildings. It is shown that methodology is very useful for assessing the seismic vulnerability of CM structures and for estimating the earthquake-induced economic losses based on an engineering demand parameter closely related to structural damage.

12987,"Fragility estimation for global building classes using analysis of the Cambridge earthquake damage database (CEQID) This paper describes CEQID, a database of earthquake damage and casualty data assembled since the 1980s based on post-earthquake damage surveys conducted by a range of research groups. Following 2017–2019 updates, the database contains damage data for more than five million individual buildings in over 1000 survey locations following 79 severely damaging earthquakes worldwide. The building damage data for five broadly defined masonry and reinforced concrete building classes has been assembled and a uniform set of six damage levels assigned. Using estimated peak ground acceleration (PGA) for each survey location based on USGS Shakemap data, a set of lognormal fragility curves has been developed to estimate the probability of exceedance of each damage level for each class, and separate fragility curves for each of five geographical regions are presented. A revised set of fragility curves has also been prepared in which the bias in the curve resulting from the uncertainty in the ground motion parameter has been removed. The uncertainty in the fragility curves is evaluated and discussed and the curves are compared with those from other studies. A resistance index for each class of building is developed and cross-regional comparisons using this resistance index are presented. © 2021, The Author(s).

12968,"Fragility curves for Italian URM buildings based on a hybrid method A hybrid seismic fragility model for territorial-scale seismic vulnerability assessment of masonry buildings is developed and presented in this paper. The method combines expert-judgment and mechanical approaches to derive typological fragility curves for Italian residential masonry building stock. The first classifies Italian masonry buildings in five different typological classes as function of age of construction, structural typology, and seismic behaviour and damaging of buildings observed following the most severe earthquakes occurred in Italy. The second, based on numerical analyses results conducted on building prototypes, provides all the parameters necessary for developing fragility functions. Peak-Ground Acceleration (PGA) at Ultimate Limit State attainable by each building’s class has been chosen as an Intensity Measure to represent fragility curves: three types of curve have been developed, each referred to mean, maximum and minimum value of PGAs defined for each building class. To represent the expected damage scenario for increasing earthquake intensities, a correlation between PGAs and Mercalli-Cancani-Sieber macroseismic intensity scale has been used and the corresponding fragility curves developed. Results show that the proposed building’s classes are representative of the Italian masonry building stock and that fragility curves are effective for predicting both seismic vulnerability and expected damage scenarios for seismic-prone areas. Finally, the fragility curves have been compared with empirical curves obtained through a macroseismic approach on Italian masonry buildings available in literature, underlining the differences between the methods. © 2021, The Author(s).

22276,"Vulnerability of Turkish low-rise and mid-rise reinforced concrete frame structures In this study, seismic safety of low-rise and mid-rise structures, which constitute approximately 75% of the total building stock in Turkey, is investigated by generating fragility curves. The scope is 3, 5, 7, and 9-story reinforced concrete moment resisting frame structures. The uncertainties in material variability and the specific characteristics of construction practice in Turkey are taken into account in the formation of structural simulations. Two-dimensional analytical models are constructed accordingly and categorized as poor, typical, or superior corresponding to the observed seismic performance of structures after major earthquakes in Turkey. The seismic demand statistics in terms of maximum interstory drift ratio are obtained for different sets of ground motion records by performing nonlinear time history analyses. The capacity is determined in terms of limit states and the corresponding fragility curves are obtained from the probability of reaching or exceeding each limit state for different levels of ground shaking. The generated fragility curves are employed in a preliminary evaluation application. For this purpose, Fatih, a highly populated earthquake-prone district in Istanbul, is selected.

This RC building is further modified by redesigning it to Indian seismic design code (IS 1893-2002 Part I) and detailing as per IS13920-1993 Indian code to investigate variability in confinement of concrete in frame elements and hence ductility on the PSDM. Sixteen ground motion records are used to study the ground motion variability. Incremental dynamic analysis is performed on numerical model, and the maximum interstorey drift is obtained as a response parameter for all simulations.

22072,"Uncertainty reduction of seismic fragility of intake tower using Bayesian Inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation The fundamental goal of this study is to minimize the uncertainty of the median fragility curve and to assess the structural vulnerability under earthquake excitation. Bayesian Inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation has been presented for efficient collapse response assessment of the independent intake water tower. The intake tower is significantly used as a diversion type of the hydropower station for maintaining power plant, reservoir and spillway tunnel. Therefore, the seismic fragility assessment of the intake tower is a pivotal component for estimating total system risk of the reservoir. In this investigation, an asymmetrical independent slender reinforced concrete structure is considered. The Bayesian Inference method provides the flexibility to integrate the prior information of collapse response data with the numerical analysis results. The preliminary information of risk data can be obtained from various sources like experiments, existing studies, and simplified linear dynamic analysis or nonlinear static analysis. The conventional lognormal model is used for plotting the fragility curve using the data from time history simulation and nonlinear static pushover analysis respectively. The Bayesian Inference approach is applied for integrating the data from both analyses with the help of MCMC simulation. The method achieves meaningful improvement of uncertainty associated with the fragility curve, and provides significant statistical and computational efficiency. bayesian inference  markov chain monte carlo simulation  seismic fragility  uncertainty  intake tower RISK-ASSESSMENT  EARTHQUAKE  METHODOLOGY  BUILDINGS  BRIDGES  CURVES",Uncertainty reduction of seismic fragility of intake tower using Bayesian Inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24570069139817172,0.03443528763867101,0.04368187669335904,0.03087664203384617,Analytical

17980,"Fragility based damage assesment in existing precast industrial buildings: A case study for Turkey In Turkey, majority of industrial facilities are composed of precast buildings. However, precast buildings have suffered extensive damage during Kocaeli and Duzce (1999) and Adana-Ceyhan (1998) earthquakes. Therefore, in this study, fragilities of existing building stock and damage probabilities of precast buildings were studied. For this purpose, building inventories were prepared and variation of structural parameters was determined by investigating the design project of 65 precast buildings constructed in Denizli, Turkey. Twelve analysis models which reflect the stiffness, strength and ductility properties of building inventory were constructed. After the definition of strain based displacement limits and corresponding damage states for buildings, displacement demands were calculated by using non linear time history analysis. During the analyses 360 strong ground motion records were used. Exceedence ratios of concerned damage limits was calculated by checking the displacement demands and then PGV based fragility curves were constructed. Efficiency of strength, stiffness and ductility properties of existing precast buildings were investigated by comparing the fragility curves. The results have shown that the most effective parameters that govern the damage probabilities of precast buildings are stiffness and ductility. It was also stated that the results of fragility analysis and damage and failure observations performed after Kocaeli and Duzce Earthquakes are compatible.

18242,"Hindcast of pluvial, fluvial, and coastal flood damage in Houston, Texas during Hurricane Harvey (2017) using SFINCS As demonstrated by recent tropical cyclone events, including U.S. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria (2017), and Florence (2018), the destructive potential of flooding driven by wind, precipitation, and coastal surge coupled with growing exposure of people and property along coastlines is leading to unprecedented damage from coastal storms. In this paper, we demonstrate the ability of the recently developed Super-Fast INundation of CoastS (SFINCS) model to delineate the depth and extent of flooding during Hurricane Harvey in Houston, Texas. The model was validated against water level time-series at twenty-one United States Geological Survey (USGS) observation points and 115 high water mark locations. FEMA depth-damage curves were used to estimate building and content damages from the combined flood sources (e.g., pluvial, fluvial, and marine) and total losses are compared against insurance claims registered with the U.S. National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and a depth grid produced during the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Preliminary Damage Assessment (PDA). The results suggest that Harvey may have caused upwards of $8.3 billion USD in uninsured residential loss within the model domain. Comparison against FEMA’s PDA indicates that the SFINCS model predicts much larger total losses, indicating that the incorporation of spatially-distributed pluvial hazards into the modeling method is critical for identifying high-risk areas and supports the need for further flood risk analyses in the region. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

16025,"Building envelope failure assessment framework for residential communities subjected to hurricanes This paper presents a modular framework utilized to assess the building envelope failures of light-frame wood construction subjected to hurricane wind hazards. A component-based approach is taken to develop an integrated building envelope model that is based on previous research of individual component capacities. Key modules of the proposed framework include a wind-borne Debris Generation Module and an impact-tracking module that interact with a Hurricane Simulation Module capable of simulating suites of synthetic or historical hurricanes. A significant difference between the proposed framework and other assessment models is that the proposed framework is extremely flexible in allowing the user to define the building stock within the area of interest, which will provide the user with the ability to investigate an unlimited number of ""what if"" scenarios. Another distinction of the proposed framework is that it is driven by a mechanics-based three-dimensional probabilistic debris trajectory model developed by the authors as opposed to incorporating empirical fragility curves developed from observed post-hurricane assessments, insurance claim data, or basic probabilistic analyses of wind-borne debris. As an illustrative example of results provided by the proposed framework, a debris impact vulnerability envelope presented in a polar coordinate system are developed for a representative South Carolina coastal subdivision subjected to Hurricane Hugo. The probabilities obtained from the debris impact vulnerability envelope generated by the framework can be utilized by officials, developers, architects, and designers either pre- or post-construction to mitigate damage to the building envelope of homes within a residential community located within hurricane-prone regions. © 2013.

21433,"Socioeconomic scenarios and flood damage assessment methodologies for the Taihu Basin, China The assessment of flood risk is now widely recognised to need research and data on both the probability and the consequences of flooding; the research reported here concentrates on the latter data input. Building on the UK Foresight Future Flooding project, this paper describes the development of future scenarios through which to assess possible future flood risk in the Taihu Basin area of China. In addition, we describe the flood damage assessment model that was developed there to build on these scenarios so as to calculate anticipated risk. Acknowledged methodological limitations remain, but some important developments have resulted. First, the pre-existing flood loss data that were available from Shanghai meant that this aspect of the risk model's input was more regionally appropriate than would otherwise have been the case. Second, the damage assessment has been related both to constructed scenarios and to an agreed National Plan, so that the two can be compared. Third, the scenario construction was linked in Taihu to the statistical base contained in the 2006 Yearbook and the Fifth National Socio-economic Survey data, giving a sounder 'base case' of current flood vulnerability than used in the UK Foresight Future Flooding project.

19683,"Probabilistic Assessment of Structural Damage due to Earthquakes for Buildings in Mid-America This paper provides an approach to conduct a probabilistic assessment of structural damage due to seismic events with an application to typical building structures in mid-America. The developed methodology includes modified damage state classifications based on the Applied Technology Council (ATC)-13 and ATC-38 damage states and the ATC-38 database of building damage. Damage factors are assigned to each damage state to quantify structural damage as a percentage of structural replacement cost. To account for the inherent uncertainties, these factors are expressed as random variables with a Beta distribution. A set of fragility curves, quantifying the structural vulnerability of a building, is mapped onto the developed methodology to determine the expected structural damage. The total structural damage factor for a given seismic intensity is then calculated using a probabilistic approach. Prediction and confidence bands are also constructed to account for the prevailing uncertainties. The expected seismic structural damage is assessed for three types of building structures in the mid-American region using the developed methodology. In addition, a sensitivity analysis for the probabilistic parameters is conducted. The developed methodology provides a transparent procedure where the structural damage factors can be updated as additional seismic damage data becomes available.

15627,"Analytical fragility assessment using unscaled ground motion records It is desirable that nonlinear dynamic analyses for structural fragility assessment are performed using unscaled ground motions. The widespread use of a simple dynamic analysis procedure known as Cloud Analysis, which uses unscaled records and linear regression, has been impeded by its alleged inaccuracies. This paper investigates fragility assessment based on Cloud Analysis by adopting, as the performance variable, a scalar demand to capacity ratio that is equal to unity at the onset of limit state. It is shown that the Cloud Analysis, performed based on a careful choice of records, leads to reasonable and efficient fragility estimates. There are 2 main rules to keep in mind for record selection: to make sure that a good portion of the records leads to a demand to capacity ratio greater than unity and that the dispersion in records' seismic intensity is considerable. An inevitable consequence of implementing these rules is that one often needs to deal with the so-called collapse cases. To formally consider the collapse cases, a 5-parameter fragility model is proposed that mixes the simple regression in the logarithmic scale with logistic regression. The joint distribution of fragility parameters can be obtained by adopting a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation scheme leading directly to the fragility and its confidence intervals. The resulting fragility curves compare reasonably with those obtained from the Incremental Dynamic Analysis and Multiple Stripe Analysis with (variable) conditional spectrum-compatible suites of records at different intensity levels for 3 older reinforced concrete frames with shear-, shear-flexure-, and flexure-dominant behavior.

18612,"Investigation into analytical vulnerability curves derivation aspects considering modelling uncertainty for infilled RC buildings Reinforced concrete (RC) buildings represent the dominant type of construction in several earthquake prone countries and in the rest of the world. These structures are usually characterized by the presence of partition walls commonly made of unreinforced masonry bricks infill. To reduce the computational effort required to derive fragility functions, numerous researchers have attempted to use simplified assumptions, such as, the use of default values to model structural characteristics-related parameters (i.e., mechanical properties, geometric configuration, and dimensions), ignoring the contribution of infills in the seismic response by modelling infilled RC building as bare frame,...etc.,. However, such simplifications may highly decrease the reliability and accuracy of the obtained results introducing important epistemic uncertainty in the fragility function construction process. This paper investigates the different aspects of uncertainties resulting in adopting simplification in structural and mathematical modelling, and the resulting fragility curves. In the first section, the paper presents the results of sensitivity analysis that has been conducted examining the influence of the variation in structural characteristics-related parameters. The second section is devoted to a comparative analysis of different fragility curves developed with and without considering the contribution of infill panels (i.e. influence of numerical model completeness).

20632,"Seismic fragility assessment of low-rise stone masonry buildings Many historic buildings in old urban centers in Eastern Canada are made of stone masonry reputed to be highly vulnerable to seismic loads. Seismic risk assessment of stone masonry buildings is therefore the first step in the risk mitigation process to provide adequate planning for retrofit and preservation of historical urban centers. This paper focuses on development of analytical displacement-based fragility curves reflecting the characteristics of existing stone masonry buildings in Eastern Canada. The old historic center of Quebec City has been selected as a typical study area. The standard fragility analysis combines the inelastic spectral displacement, a structure-dependent earthquake intensity measure, and the building damage state correlated to the induced building displacement. The proposed procedure consists of a three-step development process: (1) mechanics-based capacity model, (2) displacement-based damage model and (3) seismic demand model. The damage estimation for a uniform hazard scenario of 2% in 50 years probability of exceedance indicates that slight to moderate damage is the most probable damage experienced by these stone masonry buildings. Comparison is also made with fragility curves implicit in the seismic risk assessment tools Hazus and ELER. Hazus shows the highest probability of the occurrence of no to slight damage, whereas the highest probability of extensive and complete damage is predicted with ELER. This comparison shows the importance of the development of fragility curves specific to the generic construction characteristics in the study area and emphasizes the need for critical use of regional risk assessment tools and generated results. © 2013 Institute of Engineering Mechanics, China Earthquake Administration and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. fragility analysis  seismic risk assessment  stone masonry Earthquake intensity  Fragility analysis  Probability of exceedance  Regional risk assessment  Seismic demand models  Seismic risk assessment  Spectral displacement  Stone masonry  Masonry materials  Probability  Risk assessment  Seismic design  Seismology  Masonry construction",Seismic fragility assessment of low-rise stone masonry buildings,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30510744174144055,0.01568488526183079,0.027673410984132292,0.01039366861685809,Analytical
21772,"The effects of ground motion characteristics on the seismic fragility curves of RC buildings Over the past two decades, Egypt was hit by few earthquakes that resulted in significant loss of life and property. Several Reinforced Concrete (RC) buildings were damaged or collapsed. In the present research work, the seismic vulnerability of the most common used RC building system, in Egypt, is assessed. The investigated samples include 3-, 5-, 7-and 12-story buildings. The seismic vulnerability of these sample buildings is inspected through examining the fragility curves. These curves are used to represent the probabilities that the structural damage, under various level of seismic excitation, to exceed specified damage states by means of earthquake intensity damage relations. Four damage states are defined: slight, minor, moderate, and severe, in order to express the condition of damage. Fragility curves are represented by lognormal distribution functions with two parameters and developed as a function of Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA). Different characteristics of ground motion excitation are employed in the analysis. Ground motions with different frequency contents are utilized; Low, Medium and High frequency content earthquakes. The study assesses the effects of ground motion characteristics on fragility analysis. A two dimensional finite element computer program for seismic inelastic structural analysis is employed. The computer program takes into account cracking, reinforcement of RC members and both geometric and material nonlinearity. This study represents an attempt to evaluate the seismic vulnerability of the building stock in Egypt. The results show also that the effects of input ground motion characteristics may have a significant effects on fragility curves.

15631,"Analytical Fragility Curves of Reinforced Concrete Buildings Subject to Tsunami Waves The prediction of damages caused by a tsunami over a large coastal area is a complex problem. One of the issues is the evaluation of the structural damage to buildings and infrastructures. A tsunami is preceded by a ground motion, both are caused by an earthquake. The coastal structures are hit, within a short period of time by both phenomena. In this study, we developed a method to build fragility curves for reinforced concrete structures subject to tsunami. The fragility curves are function of the intensity measure of the tsunami wave: wave height. The fragility curves of a prototype reinforced concrete building were computed through non-linear static analysis. This method can be used to assess the damage of an area once enough prototype structures are analyzed.

21316,"Shakemap and rapid earthquake damage assessment in greece Seismic risk mitigation is a major goal in countries of high seismicity. To achieve this goal, measures must be taken before, during and immediately after a catastrophic event in order to reduce loss in life and built environment and to increase resilience of the society. Knowing the spatial distribution of seismic ground motion shortly (a few minutes) after a strong earthquake is of paramount importance since it provides the input motion of exciting structures and lifelines. The dynamic response of a structure along with its seismic vulnerability define the expected damage level due to a specific excitation. That is, by knowing in advance its representative vulnerability function as well as the selected parameters of strong ground motion in near-real time, one can achieve a rapid estimation of possible damage level of the structure under investigation. The dissemination of such information to decision makers and civil protection teams, just after a disastrous event, is extremely important in managing effectively all appropriate risk mitigation interventions. However, the effectiveness of the aforementioned methodology depends on reliably estimated strong ground motion maps, the so-called shakemaps, as well as on reliable representative seismic vulnerability functions of structures or/and critical infrastructures in the area under investigation. The existing broadband accelerometer network in Greece irreplaceably contributes to a fast and credible calculation of shakemaps. The ground motion of selected shakemap scenarios are combined with a powerful approach based on Artificial Neural Network theory using selected building types representative of those met in the area of study (Cephalonia, Greece), in order to estimate expected seismic damage level (slight, moderate, heavy). Results of the applied methodology show that the scenario based on fault representation of the earthquake taking into account a local soil condition model better reflects the observed damage in the near field of the examined area. © 2019, National Technical University of Athens.

21294,"Sensitivity of fragility functions to ground motion input: Case study of 2010 Haiti Earthquake There are two inputs in the derivation of empirical fragility functions: i) Inventory of damaged and undamaged buildings, and ii) Ground motion intensity values at the buildings' locations. This study aims to investigate any variation in the resulting fragility functions, i.e. in the computed fragility parameters, if the ground motion input is changed. The previously constructed fragility curves by Hancilar et al. 2013 [1], which rely on specific shaking intensity maps published by the USGS after the 2010 Haiti Earthquake, are compared with the fragility functions computed in the present study. For the derivation of fragility curves, we utilize the same damage data set and the same methodology, i.e. maximum likelihood estimation, as provided in [1]. Building data collected by field surveys are categorized according to the European Macroseismic Scale (EMS-98) damage grades. In the field data set, there are 6, 347 buildings that are grouped with respect to structural material type and number of stories. The simplest way to account for the variability in ground motion input could have been achieved by employing different GMPEs and their standard variations. However in this work, we prefer to rely on stochastically simulated ground motions of the Haiti earthquake. We employ five different source models available in the literature and calculate the resulting strong ground motion in time domain. In our simulations we also consider the local site effects by published studies on NEHRP site classes and micro-zoning maps of the city of Port-au-Prince. We estimate the regional distributions from the waveforms simulated at the same coordinates that we have damage information from. The estimated spatial distributions of peak ground accelerations (PGA) are then used as input to fragility computations. The results show that changing the ground motion input causes significant variability in the resulting fragility functions.

17203,"Effect of long-duration earthquakes on the low-cycle fatigue damage in RC frame buildings Several cases of failure due to rupture of reinforcing bars in RC buildings were reported by inspection teams after the 2010 Muale earthquake in Chile that triggered further research efforts. This paper studies the effect of long-duration earthquakes on the damage potential due to low-cycle fatigue through nonlinear analysis of three existing RC frame buildings. The number of strain cycles and their amplitudes for reinforcing bars at the critical locations within each building were obtained from nonlinear time history analyses. The reduction in the fatigue life has been estimated using S-N curve obtained from the experimental literature and by applying the Palmgren-Miner damage rule. The results showed significant reduction in fatigue life for the low- and medium-rise buildings larger than high-rise buildings. It was found that A706 steel has longer fatigue life than A615 steel.

The estimated average seismic intensity on the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) scale is 6.1 (VIII to IX in the MMI scale). The peak frequency of the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio derived from microtremor measurements conducted during reconnaissance is also compared with the seismic intensity. Collapse rates for various structure types, such as adobe, unreinforced/ reinforced masonry, steel-frame, and reinforced concrete, are obtained by counting the number of demolished buildings within an area of about 50-m radius around an observation point. Results show large differences in collapse rates between unreinforced and reinforced masonry, and suggest the upper limit of seismic intensity that unreinforced masonry can sustain.

16850,"Development and evaluation of FLEMOps - A new Flood Loss Estimation MOdel for the private sector The estimation of flood losses is an essential component for risk-oriented flood design, risk mapping or financial appraisals in the reinsurance sector. However, only simple models, e.g. stage-damage curves, have been used frequently. Further, the reliability of flood loss and risk estimates is fairly unknown, since flood loss models are scarcely validated. In the aftermath of flooding in August 2002 large data sets of flood losses were collected at affected properties in Germany. These data were used to derive multi-factorial loss models. This paper presents FLEMOps - the Flood Loss Estimation Model for the private sector, which estimates direct monetary flood losses of residential buildings and household contents considering water level, building type and building quality. In an additional model stage (FLEMOps+), the effects of private precautionary measures as well as of the contamination of the floodwater can be quantified. Together with census data and land use information the model is adapted for applications on the meso-scale. Further, different data sets of repair costs for single buildings and in whole municipalities were used to validate loss estimates on the micro- as well as on the meso-scale. First results show that the model FLEMOps+ outperforms simple stage-damage-functions. © 2008 WIT Press.

20664,"Seismic fragility curves for RC buildings at territorial scale The seismic events recently occurred in a different part of the world remind us once again the importance of reducing the risk of the national building stock. In order to properly invest the limited funds available for the retrofit of most exposed constructions, it is fundamental an estimate of the seismic vulnerability of the different building typologies. Such vulnerability is nowadays mainly expressed in terms of fragility curves, calibrated through post-seismic observed data or simulated data obtained by building mechanical models. In this paper, empirical fragility curves are presented for existing reinforced concrete buildings based on the post-earthquake observational data collected after the 2012 Emilia earthquake. This structural typology presents large variability in terms of seismic performance, depending on the seismic design level and other parameters such as the number of stories and the building typological classifications. Various regression models and statistical procedures have been proposed over the years to obtain fragility curves, hence more than one stochastic model is adopted, in order to point out how the fragility curves parameters change by varying the assumed probabilistic distribution.

In urban areas, this vulnerability, combined with a significant concentration of buildings built before the introduction of seismic standards, may result in a high seismic risk, even in areas where the seismicity is considered moderate.

21454,"Spectral ground motion intensity based on capacity and period elongation Ground motion intensity parameters are used to express the relationship between expected structural damage and the seismic forces imposed. The graphical representation of damage probability as a function of ground motion intensity leads to fragility curves that are generally used in loss estimation studies. The most typical parameters used to represent the ground motion intensity are peak ground acceleration, peak ground velocity, spectral acceleration, and spectral displacement. Other parameters obtained from the ground motion trace and response spectra have been recommended in literature, but no consensus on which intensity parameter to use exists because of the various drawbacks of these ground motion intensities. A new spectrum ground motion intensity parameter that relies on the expected elongated period of the structure under seismic forces has been developed. This intensity measure takes into account the approximate yield capacity of the structure and the area between the fundamental and elongated period of the structure under the elastic response spectrum of the given ground motion. The correlation of this intensity measure with the calculated demand parameter, maximum interstory drift in our case, is investigated for a set of 100 ground motion records in order to verify its accuracy. This intensity measure is primarily proposed for the selection of ground motions to be used for the analyses of individual structures that are desired to respond at various levels of nonlinearity. © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.

With this regard, within the research project ReLUIS 2014-2018, typological and structural information about recurrent classes of RC buildings was collected in some municipalities of Puglia, Italy. Based on these data, it has been possible to identify some representative “Index” buildings, characterized by common morphological, mechanical and geometrical features and identified by a set of relevant characteristic parameters having a defined variation within a plausible range. In this paper, based on the available dataset of building information in some municipalities and on the results of seismic vulnerability analyses about residential RC building typologies, the fragility of representative Index buildings has been investigated. In particular, by using the data collected from a previous large-scale investigation performed in the Municipality of Bovino, preliminary regional fragility curves have been derived for of the index buildings previously defined. The significant mechanical parameters have been varied within pre-defined ranges; for each obtained “sample” simulated design has been made deriving the computational model; at last, the assessment has been performed through the development of a pushover-based procedure. The variation of the parameters and their combination have been carried out in order to appraise their influence in the regional seismic fragility. Copyright © 2019 COMPDYN Proceedings.

Generally, they consist of sets of fragility curves that are derived from georeferenced post-earthquake damage data. Following the 2015 Nepal earthquake sequence, the World Bank, through the Global Program for Safer Schools, conducted a Structural Integrity and Damage Assessment (SIDA) of about 18,000 school buildings in the earthquake-affected area. In this work, the database is utilized to identify the main structural characteristics of the Nepalese school building stock. For the first time, extended SIDA school damage data is processed to derive fragility curves for the main structural typologies. Data sets for each structural typology are used for a Bayesian updating of existing fragilities to obtain regional models for Nepalese schools. These fragility estimates can be adopted to assess potential seismic losses of the school infrastructure in Nepal.

In this context we present a performance-based framework for modeling time-variant vulnerability of reinforced concrete buildings during aftershock sequences. Structural damage is associated with first eigenperiod elongation, a performance metric whose measurement can complement visual inspection and assessment of structural health as a post-seismic operative tool. The proposed framework is applied for a series of reinforced concrete building models and two aftershock sequences. Damage states are defined using thresholds of period elongation. Numerical models of the buildings in each damage state are considered and their fragility curves are computed. The time-variant vulnerability is modeled with Markov chain as a function of the characteristics of the aftershocks sequence. Finally, the probabilities of the damage states are computed as a function of time during two real aftershock sequences. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

12574,"An engineering-based approach to predict Tornado-induced damage The tornado risk assessment methodology currently used by both private and public agencies utilizes empirically derived loss models that rely on historical claims data for predicting future effects of tornadoes. The accuracy of these empirical models is dependent on many factors, including the quality and quantity of available historical data, accuracy of the tornado intensity models, and the universality of applying those empirical models from one region to another. A more rigorous approach may be the development of engineering-based damage assessment models, made applicable to construction in any region and to any tornado that varies in size and strength. This chapter presents a framework for an engineering-based tornado damage assessment (ETDA) for low-rise buildings. The model predicts damage on the most vulnerable sector of the built environment, nonengineered residential buildings. The model components include a translating tornado vortex model, a tornado-induced wind load calculation approach, a probabilistic wind-borne debris impact model, and a time-variant model for internal pressure changes within the structure. The time evolution of structural damage to a building is determined using successive time steps of component level wind loading vs. structural resistance as the tornado translates past the building. The output of this model is a percentage damage index for each component and the overall building damage ratio. The ETDA model is illustrated using four houses damaged in the 2011 Joplin, MO, tornado. Predicted damage using the ETDA model is in good agreement (within 15?%) of post-tornado damage observations reported by the third author. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

In this analysis, the setback buildings were mainly studied because they have become increasingly popular in modern multi-storey building construction due to their functional and aesthetic architecture. Incremental dynamics analysis (IDA) was performed on these frames under three sets of repeated ground motion records. Based on the IDA curve, life safety (LS) performance level was considered as the main guideline to develop the fragility curves. The maximum inter-storey drift percentages at each storey level, for all frames and location of plastic hinges for each frame, were clearly determined through IDA. From the fragility curve results, the probability of reaching or exceeding the life safety performance state was determined. The regular frame showed the lowest probability as compared to other frames. Therefore, it is known that the building configuration of frames affects the building’s seismic performance, and thus it should be considered in the building’s seismic design. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Then, an in-depth analysis of the degree of completeness of the survey campaign is made, aiming at the identification of the Municipalities subjected to a partial survey campaign, which are discarded from fragility analysis. At the end of this stage, only the Irpinia 1980 and Lâ€™Aquila 2009 databases are considered for further elaborations, as fully complying with these criteria. The resulting database is then integrated with non-inspected buildings sited in less affected areas (assumed undamaged), to account for the negative evidence of damage. The PGA evaluated from the shakemaps of the Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) and a metric based on six damage levels according to EMS-98 are used for fragility analysis. The damage levels are obtained from observed damage collected during post-earthquake inspections through existing conversion rules, considering damage to vertical structures and infills/partitions. The maximum damage level observed on vertical structures and infills/partitions is then associated to the whole building. Fragility curves for two vulnerability classes, C2 and D, further subdivided into three classes of building height, are obtained from those derived for specific structural typologies (identified based on building height and type of design), using their frequency of occurrence at national level as weights.

19006,"Multi-hazard stochastic response assessment of base-isolated buildings The stochastic response of multi-story buildings isolated by laminated rubber bearing (LRB), lead-rubber bearing (N-Z system), friction pendulum system (FPS), and resilient-friction base isolator (R-FBI) is investigated under the independent multi-hazard scenario of earthquake ground motion (EQGM), wind load (WL), and blast-induced ground motion (BIGM), which are considered as uncertain inputs. A polynomial regression-based Monte Carlo simulation (PRBMCS) is proposed to enable computationally efficient fragility assessment of base-isolated buildings. The suitability of the PRBMCS for stochastic assessment of the base-isolated buildings is compared with the conventional Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), response surface method (RSM) and Cloud analysis. The fragility curves obtained using the PRBMCS are in good agreement with that of the MCS relatively. The study includes: the effects of the characteristic parameters of the four base isolators on the fragility of the base-isolated buildings under the three hazards; influence of the extent of uncertainty in the excitations; and comparison of fragilities of the base-isolated and fixed-base buildings. Notably, the influences of characteristic parameters of the isolators on the fragility of the base-isolated buildings are different under the three hazards. The differences in the stochastic behaviour under the different hazards could have contradictory influences on the selection of isolation parameters. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

20590,"Seismic fragility analysis of structures based on Bayesian linear regression demand models Bayesian linear regression (BLR) based demand prediction models are proposed for efficient seismic fragility analysis (SFA) of structures utilizing limited numbers of nonlinear time history analyses results. In doing so, two different BLR models i.e. one based on the classical Bayesian least squares regression and another based on the sparse Bayesian learning using Relevance Vector Machine are explored. The proposed models integrate both the record-to-record variation of seismic motions and uncertainties due to structural model parameters. The magnitude of uncertainty involved in the fragility estimate is represented by providing a confidence bound of the fragility curve. The effectiveness of the proposed BLR models are compared with the commonly used cloud method and the maximum likelihood estimates methods of SFA by considering a nonlinear single-degree-of-freedom system and a five-storey reinforced concrete building frame. It is observed that both the BLR models can estimate fragility with improved accuracy compared to those common analytical SFA approaches considering direct Monte Carlo simulation based fragility results as the benchmark.

20449,"Seismic damage evaluation for low-rise RC school buildings in Taiwan Earthquake damage is not only a disaster, but also an examination for the present structure engineering technique and a lesson for the future one. By collecting and investigating damage data, the correlation between ground motion and damage can be established directly and applied to earthquake loss estimation and hazard mitigation. ATC-13 report presented a methodology that has been widely used for estimating damage/loss caused by earthquake and collateral hazards. The major procedure includes facility classification, selection of ground motion characterization, and damage estimates for different types of structures under specific ground shaking intensity. Mostly the motion-damage relationship developed by using investigated damage data during a past earthquake is in the form of vulnerability function, also termed fragility curve. It predicts the probability of reaching or exceeding specific damage state for a category of buildings with given earthquake intensity. The vulnerability functions are feasible for damage loss estimate in a large region, such as a city or a state, yet scatter caused by insufficiency of detail in structure classification exists generally. The applicability of the functions to regions outside the area where it is originally developed is unclear as well. Seismic evaluation that concerns about localized structural behavior and ground motion characteristics is utilized to establish the motion-damage relationship for individual buildings. While detailed information and complicated calculation are required, higher accuracy and applicability may be expected. Vulnerability functions can also be developed by performing seismic evaluation procedure on representative type of model buildings. © 2009 ASCE.

16348,"Constant-damage yield strength spectra for RC structures using modified Park-Ang damage model In this study, constant-damage yield strength spectrum (CDYSS), which is defined as the yield strength demand of a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system of varying natural vibration period with the target constant damage index and specified ductility capacity, is derived by averaging the nonlinear time-history analysis results of a SDOF system under different earthquake ground motions. A modified Park-Ang damage model proposed by the authors, eliminating its non-convergence problem both at upper and lower limits with higher precision and smaller scatter, is adopted to calculate the damage index of the SDOF system. In the construction of CDYSS, 641 sets of earthquake ground motion records are adopted and classified into 12 groups in line with Chinese code for seismic design of buildings. The yield strength demands of SDOF systems with given ductility capacity are obtained through trial and error method. Then, the mean CDYSS and the corresponding coefficient of variation for different group of site soil conditions are calculated. The effects of ductility capacity and local site soil conditions on CDYSS are discussed.

15083,"A computational framework for large-scale seismic simulations of residential building stock Urban areas reveal particularly vulnerable due to the high concentration of people and, in many cases, their hazard-prone location. Indeed, according to data from the United Nations, about 2/3 of the population will live in large cities by 2050, and the majority of the world's cities are highly exposed to disasters. This paper presents a computational framework to assess the seismic vulnerability and the damage of residential building portfolio in urban areas. First, a surrogated model is proposed to estimate the global capacity of building structures. Monte Carlo simulations are implemented to take into account the uncertainties associated with the material, mechanical, and geometrical parameters. The proposed approach is validated through nonlinear finite element models and a real case study. Then, the proposed computational framework is implemented and applied to a virtual city that is envisioned for being representative of a typical Italian residential building stock.

20463,"Seismic damage identification in buildings using neural networks and modal data A seismic damage identification method intended for buildings with steel moment-frame structure is presented in this paper. The method has a statistical approach and is based on artificial neural networks and modal variables. It consists of two main stages. The initial one is devoted to the calibration of the undamaged structure and the final one to the identification of the damaged structure after an earthquake. The inputs of the nets are the first flexural modes (frequencies and mode shapes) at each principal direction of the structure and the outputs are the spatial variables (mass and stiffness). A damage index at each storey is determined by comparing the initial and final stiffness. A simplified finite element model was used to generate the data needed to train the nets. This model is consistent with available modal data and damage definition. The method was simulated on a 5-storey office building under conditions as close as possible to reality. The robustness of the method was verified with simulated data. Latter on, a sensitivity analysis of the mass variability was also carried out. Finally, the influence of modal error in the accuracy of damage predictions was statistically studied. Results are successful as concern as the robustness of the method. However, it is found that this approach is quite sensitive to modal errors.

15306,"A probabilistic seismic risk assessment procedure for nuclear power plants: (I) Methodology A new procedure for probabilistic seismic risk assessment of nuclear power plants (NPPs) is proposed. This procedure modifies the current procedures using tools developed recently for performance-based earthquake engineering of buildings. The proposed procedure uses (a) response-based fragility curves to represent the capacity of structural and nonstructural components of NPPs, (b) nonlinear response-history analysis to characterize the demands on those components, and (c) Monte Carlo simulations to determine the damage state of the components. The use of response-rather than ground-motion-based fragility curves enables the curves to be independent of seismic hazard and closely related to component capacity. The use of Monte Carlo procedure enables the correlation in the responses of components to be directly included in the risk assessment.

21852,"The role of socio-economic and property variables in the establishment of flood depth-damage curve for the data-scarce area in Malaysia Flood is a frequent natural hazard worldwide that has significant financial consequences. Physical damages caused by floods are commonly estimated by stage-damage functions. However, these methods usually consider only the water depth and the type of buildings at risk. This study uses the empirical dataset collected from 2013 flood in the Kuantan River Basin to explore the influence of impact and resistance variables on the level of flood damages using the tree-based Random Forest approach. Due to data scarcity, the multivariate flood damage model has been utilized to establish the flood damage curves in the study area. As the result, in addition to flood depth, flood damage is also influenced by flood duration, value of properties, types of properties and business/household income. The obtained flood depth–damage curves are sufficient and comparable with other studies, with the R 2 of more than 0.80 for both residential and commercial categories. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Analysis was performed using truncated Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA). Fragility function was defined as a log-normal Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) and maximum likelihood method was used to estimate fragility parameters.

20670,"Seismic fragility curves for wind-designed-buildings in Hong Kong This paper presents a simple analytical method to generate seismic fragility curves for low-rise to high-rise buildings in Hong Kong. In particular, the seismic vulnerability is assumed proportional to the sectional areas of the column and shear walls of the structure. Three wind-code-designed buildings were selected as examples for the present analysis, namely a 6-story school building by the Architectural Services Department, and a 21-story residential building at Mei Foo Sun Chuen and a 40-story residential building of the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA). Instead of using intensity, seismic hazard is prescribed in terms of peak ground acceleration (PGA) in the present study. The adopted response spectra are site-dependent and depend on whether the design earthquakes are near field or far field. The seismic responses of buildings are analyzed using the equivalent static force approach for multi-degree-of-freedom-oscillators, expressed in terms of the fundamental site period and epicentral distances. The ductility distribution of buildings is then formulated as a log-normal distribution. Finally, the vulnerability of the structure is given as fragility curves. The results indicate that damage probability is highly sensitive to the number of story or building height, structural scheming, and functional usage of the buildings; other parameters such as site condition and epicentral distance are equally crucial to the structural seismic vulnerability. The conclusion should also be expected for other wind-designed buildings in Hong Kong and other parts of the world. fragility curves  tall-buildings  epicentral distance  site condition  near field and far field earthquakes  PGA input None",Seismic fragility curves for wind-designed-buildings in Hong Kong,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37864234836662053,0.03715336725132126,0.03944354855478853,0.0379777209955164,Analytical
17428,"Estimating uncertainty in limit state capacities for reinforced concrete frame structures through pushover analysis In seismic fragility and risk analysis, the definition of structural limit state (LS) capacities is of crucial importance. Traditionally, LS capacities are defined according to design code provisions or using deterministic pushover analysis without considering the inherent randomness of structural parameters. To assess the effects of structural randomness on LS capacities, ten structural parameters that include material strengths and gravity loads are considered as random variables, and a probabilistic pushover method based on a correlation-controlled Latin hypercube sampling technique is used to estimate the uncertainties in LS capacities for four typical reinforced concrete frame buildings. A series of ten LSs are identified from the pushover curves based on the design-code-given thresholds and the available damage-controlled criteria. The obtained LS capacities are further represented by a lognormal model with the median m(C) and the dispersion beta(C). The results show that structural uncertainties have limited influence on m(C) for the LSs other than that near collapse. The commonly used assumption of beta(C) between 0.25 and 0.30 overestimates the uncertainties in LS capacities for each individual building, but they are suitable for a building group with moderate damages. A low uncertainty as beta(C)=0.1 similar to 0.15 is adequate for the LSs associated with slight damages of structures, while a large uncertainty as beta(C)=0.40 similar to 0.45 is suggested for the LSs near collapse. limit state  pushover analysis  RC frame  uncertainty analysis  correlation-reduced Latin hypercube sampling INCREMENTAL DYNAMIC-ANALYSIS  FRAGILITY CURVES  SENSITIVITY  BUILDINGS  COLUMNS  SYSTEMS  MODELS",Estimating uncertainty in limit state capacities for reinforced concrete frame structures through pushover analysis,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5560518275460078,0.008918367344417488,0.03568216141278032,0.007916359329666698,Analytical

Even-though Malaysia is outside the earthquake region, the country had experienced and did suffer from major cases due earthquake in the past like tsunami. Engineers should concern and consider the loading for reinforced concrete building due to earthquake in the building design procedure. The study addresses the performance of critical frame reinforced concrete building when subjected to earthquake motion. Six (6) reinforced concrete buildings which are mostly categorized as medium-rise moment resisting frames have been selected for damage assessment. The effect of adopting a variation of low earthquake intensities (0.05g, 0.10g, 0.15g, 0.2g) in the assessment with the ground motion scale of 5% damped spectral acceleration was also assessed. The building was analyzed using Finite Element Modelling (FEM) using IDARC (2D) with respect to various earthquake intensities obtained from Time History Analysis (THA) data. The yield point at the beam-column connections was analyzed to determine the damage indices and damage level of the building subjected to the various earthquake intensities. The building performed the early yielding point at 3.22 sec for beam element at the intensity of 0.01g. Based on the results, it was found that all buildings can withstand an earthquake occurrence with intensity up to 0.20g.

16767,"Derivation of fragility curves for traditional timber-framed masonry buildings using nonlinear static analysis Recent earthquakes and two experimental campaigns on timber-framed masonry walls have shown that timber-framed masonry buildings possess a good displacement capacity and hence can withstand severe earthquakes without collapse. In the present paper, timber-framed masonry panels with diagonal braces are studied. Using a simplified model based on non-linear (NL) lumped plasticity strut elements, NL analyses are carried out of typical traditional buildings in Lefkas (Greece) with diagonally braced timber-framed masonry walls in their lateral load resisting system. Furthermore, an investigation is carried out regarding the foundation of the buildings. The key feature of the Lefkas buildings is their dual structural system. The primary system consists of a stone masonry ground floor and all upper floors are made of timber-framed masonry walls. Timber posts in the ground floor, a few centimetres apart from the stone masonry, constitute the secondary structural system which is connected to the upper floors. This latter system is activated once the ground floor stone masonry piers fail. Two different structural models are developed to simulate each system. Pushover curves are derived from the NL analyses of the buildings and are then converted into capacity curves assuming the fundamental mode dominates. On these curves four damage states (slight damage, moderate damage, heavy damage and collapse) are defined on the basis of criteria related to the actual response of the building. The first three damage states are defined on the capacity curve of the primary system, whilst the ultimate damage state is related to the response of the secondary system. Then, fragility curves in terms of spectral displacement are generated, adopting a log-normal statistical distribution of the probability of damage.

20530,"Seismic fragility analysis of a reinforced concrete building under different natural ground motions Fragility curves indicate the probability of structural damage caused by earthquakes as a function of ground motion indices such as peak ground acceleration (PGA), peak ground velocity (PGV), spectral acceleration (Sa), and spectral displacement (Sd). This study examines the fragility curves of a reinforced concrete building subjected to different natural ground motions. For this purpose, a representative high-rise reinforced concrete building located in Istanbul was selected. In order to assess the seismic performance of the existing building, some natural earthquake records with different characteristics were used. The ground motion records were classified according to their PGA to PGV ratios (a/v ratios). Based on a/v ratio, three sets of natural ground motions were considered i.e. low, intermediate, and high. Then, nonlinear time history analyses were carried out to provide the structural response of the existing building. Using a probabilistic seismic demand model obtained by regression analysis on the simulated damage data, the individual fragility curves for slight, moderate, major, and collapse damage states were constructed. Thus, the fragility curves of the existing building were achieved for three different classifications of a/v ratio. As a result, it was observed that the variations in the characteristic of the ground motion had pronounced effect on the developed fragility curves (or probability of vulnerability) of the building.

15806,"Assessment of Structure-Specific Fargility Curves for Soft Storey Buldings Implementing IDA and SPO Approaches Soft storey building is popular due to the functional and aesthetic purpose, despite its weakness in resisting seismic excitation. Nonlinear Static (Pushover) Analysis (POA) is a time saving and simple assessment procedure prosposed in Eurocode 8 (EC8). However, its reliability in designing structure still remains a question. At the first stage, seismic performance of several building models using POA in EC8 is assessed. Later on, empirical accuracy of fragility curves generated by POA (using SPO2FRAG software) is studied and verified through Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA) results. Four models of regular and soft storey frame of 5- and 11-storey varying heights were designed according to Eurocode 2 (EC2) and (EC8). The simulation is performed in a NL platform to carry out POA and IDA. Capacity curve obtained is served as main input in SPO2FRAG software to generate fragility curve. Then, IDA is performed to generate IDA and fragility curves. Peak ground acceleration, PGA was converted into corresponding Sa(T1) using design spectrum from EC8. Performance levels of Life Safety (LS) and Near Collapse (NC) proposed by Vision-2000 have been the main interest in this study.

17483,"Evaluation HSE of a LSF system subject to near- and far-field earthquakes The Lightweight Steel Framing (LSF) system has been proposed as an economical and earthquake resistant system. Due to the lightweight nature of LSF structures, the seismic performance of middle-rise buildings has been improved. Currently, various numerical-analytical methods have been proposed for seismic assessment of conventional structures. Providing a perfect seismic Health Safety Environment (HSE) index has always been regarded as one of the analytical passive points. In this research, an LSF building was selected as a case study for Finite Element (FE) modelling, in which non-linear time-history analyses were undertaken. Material properties were defined according to the performed experimental studies. A novel approach was presented for the seismic HSE index of LSF systems using the simultaneous incorporation of the non-linear analysis results and the correction coefficient describing the seismic geotechnical effects. The presented seismic HSE index accurately demonstrates the seismic performance of the LSF structures. Additionally, a two-layer perceptron Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was trained using the results of the FE model, and a non-linear relationship was obtained to predict the seismic damage index. Finally, the proposed seismic HSE index was validated using statistical analyses, indicating that the proposed method does not yield a significant difference compared to the ANN results.

19101,"New tsunami damage functions developed in the framework of SCHEMA project: application to European-Mediterranean coasts In the framework of the European SCenarios for tsunami Hazard-induced Emergencies MAnagement (SCHEMA) project (www.schemaproject.org), we empirically developed new tsunami damage functions to be used for quantifying the potential tsunami damage to buildings along European-Mediterranean coasts. Since no sufficient post-tsunami observations exist in the Mediterranean areas, we based our work on data collected by several authors in Banda Aceh (Indonesia) after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Obviously, special attention has been paid in focusing on Indonesian buildings which present similarities (in structure, construction material, number of storeys) with the building typologies typical of the European-Mediterranean areas. An important part of the work consisted in analyzing, merging, and interpolating the post-disaster observations published by three independent teams in order to obtain the spatial distribution of flow depths necessary to link the flow-depth hazard parameter to the damage level observed on buildings. Then we developed fragility curves (showing the cumulative probability to have, for each flow depth, a damage level equal-to or greater-than a given threshold) and damage curves (giving the expected damage level) for different classes of buildings. It appears that damage curves based on the weighted mean damage level and the maximum flow depth are the most appropriate for producing, under GIS, expected damage maps for different tsunami scenarios.

21176,"Seismic vulnerability assessment of RC buildings with setback irregularity This study aims to perform a fragility analysis of RC buildings subjected to seismic loading. For this purpose, the curves of fragility are developed for 20 building models with different setback values. Using a finite element calculation program, nonlinear static analyses are performed. The outcomes indicate that the performance of building structures is highly affected due to the setback. Also, the seismic fragility is more pronounced when setback passes from level 1 to level 4. The fragility analysis shows that, for a setback value equal to 50%, the difference between the probability of damage, when the setback passes from the bottom of the structure to level 4, is 12.19%, 30.85%, 37.03%, and 41.16% for a slight, moderate, severe, and complete state of damage, respectively. Moreover, the structures with a setback on the fourth floor exhibit poor seismic performance, and therefore, a high probability of damage. © 2021 THE AUTHORS Fragility curves  Nonlinear static analysis  RC buildings  Seismic vulnerability  Setback irregularity Concrete buildings  Static analysis  Fragility analysis  High probability  Non-linear static analysis  Performance of buildings  Seismic fragility  Seismic loadings  Seismic Performance  Seismic vulnerability  Seismology",Seismic vulnerability assessment of RC buildings with setback irregularity,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09920506765374978,0.021560225312930042,0.018558948820979606,0.056193586161083164,Analytical
15791,"Assessment of seismic fragility curves for low- and mid-rise reinforced concrete frame buildings using Duzce field database This paper focuses on the generation of fragility curves for low-rise and mid-rise reinforced concrete frame buildings, which constitute approximately 75% of the total building stock in Turkey and which are generally occupied for residential purposes. These buildings, which suffered extensive damage after recent earthquakes, are not designed according to the current code regulations and the supervision in the construction phase is not adequate. Hence the buildings possess many deficiencies like irregularities in plan and elevation, weak column-strong beam connections, poor concrete quality, inadequate detailing of reinforcement in hinging zones, etc. In this study, the test bed, which represents the characteristics of the aforementioned frame buildings, is selected as the Duzce field database. The influence of ground motion characteristics, structural input parameters, sampling techniques, sample size, type of hysteresis model and limit state definitions on the response statistics is investigated and fragility curves for low- and mid-rise reinforced concrete structures in Turkey are proposed as an end product. fragility  reinforced concrete buildings  sampling techniques  capacity curve  limit states INPUT VARIABLES",Assessment of seismic fragility curves for low- and mid-rise reinforced concrete frame buildings using Duzce field database,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31936312152414165,0.05847362809925107,0.07132463195163506,0.008954345753471595,Analytical
21458,"SPO2FRAG: software for seismic fragility assessment based on static pushover SPO2FRAG (Static PushOver to FRAGility) is introduced, a MATLAB®-coded software tool for estimating structure-specific seismic fragility curves of buildings, using the results of static pushover analysis. The SPO2FRAG tool (available online at http://wpage.unina.it/iuniervo/doc_en/SPO2FRAG.htm) eschews the need for computationally demanding dynamic analyses by simulating the results of incremental dynamic analysis via the SPO2IDA algorithm and an equivalent single-degree-of-freedom approximation of the structure. Subsequently, fragility functions may be calculated for multiple limit states, using the intensity-measure-based analytical approach. The damage thresholds may also be random variables and uncertainty in estimation of the fragility parameters may be explicitly accounted for. The research background underlying the various modules comprising SPO2FRAG is presented together with an operational description of how the various functions are integrated within the software’s graphical user interface. Two illustrative SPO2FRAG applications are also offered, using a steel and a reinforced concrete moment resisting frame. Finally, the software’s output is compared with the results of incremental dynamic analysis as validation of SPO2FRAG’s effectiveness. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

19067,"Multivariate Probabilistic Seismic Demand Model for the Bridge Multidimensional Fragility Analysis Seismic fragility analysis for bridges is an essential issue for risk assessment of transportation networks exposed to seismic hazards. Considering multiple Performance Limit States (PLSs) and seismic demand parameters, the study proposes a multidimensional fragility evaluation methodology for engineering structures, and the objective of the paper is to show that the uncertainty and dependence between seismic demand parameters should be considered for fragility analysis. Thus, a new Probabilistic Seismic Demand Model (PSDM) following multivariate logarithmic normal distribution is addressed. Taking PLS correlation into consideration, multidimensional PLS formula is constructed to identify the structural failure domain. A RC bridge is studied to show the proposed theory. To consider bridge column plastic deformation and bearing nonlinear characteristic, nonlinear dynamic analyses are carried out. The bridge multidimensional fragility curves are derived and compared with fragility curves for an individual component. Results indicate that uncertainty and dependence of demand parameters can be properly dealt with by the multivariate PSDM. The multidimensional fragility is higher than fragility of any individual component, and the bridge as a system is more fragile. The ignorance of multiple components contribution to the system will generate an overestimation for the whole structural performance, which is adverse to engineering structural safety. multidimensional fragility evaluation  performance limit state  probabilistic seismic demand model  multivariate logarithmic normal  nonlinear dynamic analysis HIGHWAY BRIDGES  INTENSITY MEASURES  GROUND MOTION  BUILDINGS  DISTRIBUTIONS  PERFORMANCE  CURVES",Multivariate Probabilistic Seismic Demand Model for the Bridge Multidimensional Fragility Analysis,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18256916625011674,0.011364901251515853,0.020946380087647147,0.29190600412225115,ML

In its classical definition, seismic risk is obtained from the convolution of hazard, vulnerability and exposure. Due to the absence ofreliable data on exposure for the entire Italian territory, this study proposes typological seismic risk maps, obtained by simply convolving hazard and vulnerability forseveral building typologies characteristic of the Italian building stock. A specifichazard study in terms of PGA has been carried out. The results have then been convolved with empirical typological fragility curves, that were derived from data collected during post-earthquake surveys after the main Italian events of the last 30 years.

17474,"Evaluating the effect of flood damage-reducing measures: a case study of the unembanked area of Rotterdam, the Netherlands Empirical evidence of increasing flood damages and the prospect of climatic change has initiated discussions in the flood management community on how to effectively manage flood risks. In the Netherlands, the framework of multi-layer safety (MLS) has been introduced to support this risk-based approach. The MLS framework consists of three layers: (i) prevention, (ii) spatial planning and (iii) evacuation. This paper presents a methodology to evaluate measures in the second layer, such as wet proofing, dry proofing or elevating buildings. The methodology uses detailed land-use data for the area around the city of Rotterdam (up to building level) that has recently become available. The vulnerability of these detailed land-use classes to flooding is assessed using the stage-damage curves from different international models. The methodology is demonstrated using a case study in the unembanked area of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, as measures from the second layer may be particularly effective there. The results show that the flood risk in the region is considerable: EUR 36 million p.a. A large part (almost 60 %) of this risk results from industrial land use, emphasising the need to give this category more attention in flood risk assessments. It was found that building level measures could substantially reduce flood risks in the region because of the relatively low inundation levels of buildings. Risk to residential buildings would be reduced by 40 % if all buildings would be wet-proofed, by 89 % if all buildings would be dry-proofed and elevating buildings over 100 cm would render the risk almost zero. While climate change could double the risk in 2100, such building level measures could easily nullify this effect. Despite the high potential of such measures, actual implementation is still limited. This is partly caused by the lack of knowledge regarding these measures by most Dutch companies and the legal impossibility for municipalities to enforce most of these measures as they would go beyond the building codes established at the national level.

19803,"Probabilistic seismic performance evaluation of non-seismic RC frame buildings In this paper, probabilistic seismic performance assessment of a typical non-seismic RC frame building representative of a large inventory of existing buildings in developing countries is conducted. Nonlinear time-history analyses of the sample building are performed with 20 large-magnitude medium distance ground motions scaled to different levels of intensity represented by peak ground acceleration and 5% damped elastic spectral acceleration at the first mode period of the building. The hysteretic model used in the analyses accommodates stiffness degradation, ductility-based strength decay, hysteretic energy-based strength decay and pinching due to gap opening and closing. The maximum inter story drift ratios obtained from the time-history analyses are plotted against the ground motion intensities. A method is defined for obtaining the yielding and collapse capacity of the analyzed structure using these curves. The fragility curves for yielding and collapse damage levels are developed by statistically interpreting the results of the time-history analyses. Hazard-survival curves are generated by changing the horizontal axis of the fragility curves from ground motion intensities to their annual probability of exceedance using the log-log linear ground motion hazard model.

17938,"Fragility analysis of the roof structure of low-rise buildings subjected to tornado vortices The fragility curves of roof failures for wood-frame low-rise building were developed in this study with the focus on the roof sheathing panels and roof-to-wall connections. Two different nail spacings for roof sheathing panels and three types of roof-to-wall connections were considered. This study focused on the first failure of roof sheathing panels without considering the sequential loss of the sheathing panels, and the unit failure of effective wind zones containing different numbers of roof-to-wall connections. The tornado simulator-based dataset was used for determination of the statistics of wind loads, without considering the translational motion effects of tornado vortices. The results show that the failure probability of roof is dependent on the proximity of a tornado to a building and the opening azimuth on walls. Additionally, the combined effects of pressure drop and aerodynamic interactions dominate the failure modes of roof system. The obtained fragility curves in this study can be used to estimate the maximum tangential wind speed of the tornado vortices and the local oncoming tangential wind speed at roof height.

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of two categories of earthquake events on the fragile curve (FRC) of the steel construction system. In this study, the relative lateral displacement of the structures is considered as a damage criterion. The limits set for modifying the relative lateral position in the HAZUS instruction are used to determine the failure modes, which include: slight, moderate, extensive and complete. The results show, as time strong-motion increases, the probability of exceeding (PoE) increases (for Peak ground acceleration (PGA) less than 0.5). The increase in seismic demand increases the probability of exceeding. In other words, it increases the probability of exceeding, if the maximum earthquake acceleration increases.

Spectral acceleration-based fragility curves and damage probability matrix under various damage states are developed for midrise RC frames with and without BMI. The comparative fragility curves for buildings with and without BMI are presented. It is concluded that the BMI frame have shown superior performance during earthquake in all modes of different damage states and the dispersion of Damage Measures (DM) and Intensity Measures (IM) in IDA analysis are less in the case of BMI thus improve robustness of the building response results in predictability in design.

Global period change and maximum interstorey drift are used as damage indices (DI) to indicate the changes in building stiffness and information about local and storey damages. The former uses the dynamic parameter of the structure that is related to the increase in the natural period of the structure with increased displacement demand. The latter uses the maximum interstorey drift, θmax (%), to identify the limit states thresholds defined by FEMA 356. DI is then correlated to mean damage ratio (MDR) to represent the vulnerability curve of a group of buildings.

19685,"Probabilistic assessment of structural seismic damage for buildings in Mid-America This paper provides an approach to conduct a probabilistic assessment of structural damage due to seismic events with an application to typical building structures in Mid-America. The developed methodology includes modified damage state classifications based on the ATC-13 and ATC-38 damage states and the ATC-38 database of building damage. Damage factors are assigned to each damage state to quantify structural damage as a percentage of structural replacement cost. To account for the inherent uncertainties, these factors are expressed as random variables with a Beta distribution. A set of fragility curves, quantifying the structural vulnerability of a building, is mapped onto the developed methodology to determine the expected structural damage. The total structural damage factor for a given seismic intensity is then calculated using a probabilistic approach. Prediction and confidence bands are also constructed to account for the prevailing uncertainties. The expected seismic structural damage is assessed for a typical building structure in the Mid-America region using the developed methodology.

Thus, the present study thoroughly estimates the seismic vulnerability, which includes (i) extended finite fault modelling, for generating ground motion at bedrock level, (ii) multichannel analysis of surface wave (MASW) testing on soft soil site and 1-D ground response analysis to simulate amplification caused by soft soil site and (iii) nonlinear analysis of buildings. A four-storey reinforced concrete (RC) building with different arrangements of unreinforced masonry (URM) infill is considered, namely bare frame (BF), open ground storey (OGS), fully infill (FI) frame and partially infill (PI) frame. The finite element models of these frames are developed in opensees to study their nonlinear dynamic behaviour using synthetically generated ground motions. Finally, the fragility curves are generated for all four building frames. The results show that the median peak ground acceleration (PGA) value of the PI frame is almost two times the OGS frame for all damage states. Also, the BF, PI and FI frames designed using standard practices shows the performance level of collapse prevention, whereas the OGS shows a high damage probability of collapse under design-level earthquake. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

18051,"Fragility curves of non-ductile RC frame buildings on saturated soils including liquefaction effects and soil–structure interaction Liquefaction constitutes the most common source of seismic damage to buildings resting on saturated soils. Soil-structure interaction (SSI) may also significantly affect the seismic response of structures, modifying their dynamic characteristics and the seismic response at the foundation level. Although progress has been made on the investigation of the influence of soil liquefaction and SSI on the structural response, studies combining both phenomena are very limited. To bridge this gap, we investigate the integrated influence of both liquefaction and SSI on the seismic response and vulnerability of low-code reinforced concrete (RC) moment resisting frame buildings. A two-storey non-ductile RC frame building is adopted as reference. The following numerical models are developed: (1) a fixed-base structure subjected to free-field (FF) motion neglecting liquefaction (and SSI); (2) a fixed-base structure subjected to FF motion allowing liquefaction; (3) a flexible-base structure (i.e. including SSI) resting on soil subjected to outcrop bedrock motion neglecting liquefaction; (4) a flexible-base structure resting on soil subjected to outcrop bedrock motion allowing liquefaction. Conducting nonlinear incremental dynamic analysis for the above-described configurations, we derive seismic fragility curves considering (or not) SSI and/or liquefaction effects for different damage limit states through statistical correlation of the calculated engineering demand parameter with appropriate intensity measures. We also generate vulnerability curves to quantify the expected structural losses. Results show the substantive role of liquefaction and SSI in altering the seismic fragility and vulnerability of non-ductile low-rise RC frame buildings. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

21127,"Seismic vulnerability assessment of concrete shear wall buildings through fragility analysis Seismic vulnerability assessment of shear wall buildings can be conducted through non-linear dynamic analysis, which requires detailed analytical modeling, the consideration of different earthquake intensity and structural performance measures. Reinforced concrete shear wall buildings were designed for Vancouver, representing a region of high seismicity in Canada, to assess seismic vulnerability of buildings constructed before and after the enactment of modern seismic design codes. The buildings either had a two-storey or a five-storey height, designed either using the 1965 or the 2010 National Building Code of Canada. Analytical models were generated for non-linear response time history analysis using computer software PRFORM-3D. Fiber-discretized sections were used for flexural response based on constitutive models for concrete and reinforcing steel. The nonlinear behavior in shear was modelled on the basis of sectional non-linear shear response. The shear wall models were validated against experimental data available in the literature before incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) was employed to generate fragility curves. Spectral acceleration at the fundamental period was used as seismic intensity parameter and inter-storey drift of the first floor was selected as the damage indicator. Performance limits considered include Immediate Occupancy, Life Safety and Collapse Prevention. The resulting fragility curves indicate that the life safety intent of the 2010 building designs has been met, while the same requirements could not be satisfied for the 1965 building designs. © 2017 Fragility curves  Incremental dynamic analysis  Nonlinear modeling  Seismic evaluation  Shear walls Analytical models  Architectural design  Building codes  Buildings  Concretes  Dynamic analysis  Earthquakes  Reinforced concrete  Seismic design  Seismology  Shear walls  Steel fibers  Structural analysis  Fragility curves  Incremental dynamic analysis  National Building Code of Canada  Non-linear dynamic analysis  Non-linear model  Reinforced concrete shear walls  Seismic evaluation  Structural performance  Walls (structural partitions)",Seismic vulnerability assessment of concrete shear wall buildings through fragility analysis,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3588481070685851,0.006805282975810725,0.08115148152774361,0.010787244885234826,Analytical
18690,"Large-scale seismic risk assessment integrating nonlinear soil behavior and soil-structure interaction effects The need for an accurate risk assessment procedure led to the development of various fragility and vulnerability curves, covering a wide range of building typologies. Nonlinear soil behavior and soil-structure interaction (SSI) effects play an essential role in this outcome; nevertheless, their influence is usually neglected. While for building-specific applications, these effects may be explicitly considered, it is currently impossible to account for such effects in large-scale seismic risk analyses. We examine the effectiveness of a broad set of fragility modifiers (FM) that shift existing fragility curves appropriately to consider nonlinear soil behavior and/or SSI. We apply our method to an existing block of-mainly-residential buildings in Thessaloniki, Greece. To derive the fragility curves for the building block, we perform (i) incremental dynamic analyses of the existing individual structures considering nonlinear soil behavior and SSI, (ii) incremental dynamic analyses of the existing structures neglecting the underlying soil, (iii) fragility assessment using existing fragility curves found in literature and (iv) fragility assessment using existing fragility curves found in literature, but modified using our proposed FM to account for nonlinear soil behavior and SSI. Next, assessment is also performed in terms of vulnerability. A comparison between the obtained results highlights the effectiveness of the proposed FM for large-scale risk assessment, and the necessity to consider soil-related effects. In particular, the results are compared in terms of fragility and vulnerability. Since the selection of the block is representative of the city center of Thessaloniki, our results will be indicative for city-level applications.

22212,"Vulnerability Analysis of Ancient Timber Architecture by Considering the Correlation of Different Failure Modes The paper proposes an innovative method of analyzing the seismic fragility of ancient timber architecture. The method is based on the Copulas, in which correlation between different failure modes is considered. This method is applied to assess the vulnerability of ancient timber architecture in Ming dynasty. The assessment includes four steps. In the first step, the incremental dynamic analysis is employed to establish seismic vulnerability curves of different failure modes for the structure. After that, Copula joint distribution function is used to analyze the correlation among different failure modes. In the third step, fragility curves considering correlation among different failure modes are established. In the last step, the fragility curves are compared with those obtained by first-order bound method. The results show that seismic vulnerability of ancient timber architecture based on the Copulas is greater than that of any single failure modes. Moreover, the occurrence probability ranges between the upper and lower boundaries of the first-order bound method, but is close to the lower boundary.

19387,"Parametric model for capacity curves A parametric model for capacity curves and capacity spectra is proposed. The capacity curve is considered to be composed of a linear part and a nonlinear part. The normalized nonlinear part is modelled by means of a cumulative lognormal function. Instead, the cumulative Beta function can be used. Moreover, this new conceptualization of the capacity curves allows defining stiffness and energy functions relative to the total energy loss and stiffness degradation at the ultimate capacity point. Based on these functions, a new damage index is proposed and it is shown that this index, obtained from nonlinear static analysis, is compatible with the Park and Ang index obtained from dynamic analysis. This capacity based damage index allows setting up a fragility model. Specific reinforced concrete buildings are used to illustrate the adequacy of the capacity, damage and fragility models. The usefulness of the models here proposed is highlighted showing how the parametric model is representative for a family of capacity curves having the same normalized nonlinear part and how important variables can be tabulated as empirical functions of the two main parameters defining the capacity model. The availability of this new mathematical model may be a powerful tool for current earthquake engineering research, especially in seismic risk assessments at regional scale and in probabilistic approaches where massive computations are needed. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

19284,"On the influence of input data quality to Flood Damage Estimation: The performance of the INSYDE model IN-depth SYnthetic Model for Flood Damage Estimation (INSYDE) is a model for the estimation of flood damage to residential buildings at the micro-scale. This study investigates the sensitivity of INSYDE to the accuracy of input data. Starting from the knowledge of input parameters at the scale of individual buildings for a case study, the level of detail of input data is progressively downgraded until the condition in which a representative value is defined for all inputs at the census block scale. The analysis reveals that two conditions are required to limit the errors in damage estimation: the representativeness of representatives values with respect to micro-scale values and the local knowledge of the footprint area of the buildings, being the latter the main extensive variable adopted by INSYDE. Such a result allows for extending the usability of the model at the meso-scale, also in different countries, depending on the availability of aggregated building data. © 2017 by the authors.

20390,"Seismic damage assessment based on regional synthetic ground motion dataset: a case study for Erzincan, Turkey Estimation of seismic losses is a fundamental step in risk mitigation in urban regions. Structural damage patterns depend on the regional seismic properties and the local building vulnerability. In this study, a framework for seismic damage estimation is proposed where the local building fragilities are modeled based on a set of simulated ground motions in the region of interest. For this purpose, first, ground motion records are simulated for a set of scenario events using stochastic finite-fault methodology. Then, existing building stock is classified into specific building types represented with equivalent single-degree-of-freedom models. The response statistics of these models are evaluated through nonlinear time history analysis with the simulated ground motions. Fragility curves for the classified structural types are derived and discussed. The study area is Erzincan (Turkey), which is located on a pull-apart basin underlain by soft sediments in the conjunction of three active faults as right-lateral North Anatolian Fault, left-lateral North East Anatolian Fault, and left-lateral Ovacik Fault. Erzincan city center experienced devastating earthquakes in the past including the December 27, 1939 (Ms = 8.0) and the March 13, 1992 (Mw = 6.6) events. The application of the proposed method is performed to estimate the spatial distribution of the damage after the 1992 event. The estimated results are compared against the corresponding observed damage levels yielding a reasonable match in between. After the validation exercise, a potential scenario event of Mw = 7.0 is simulated in the study region. The corresponding damage distribution indicates a significant risk within the urban area. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

21066,"Seismic shear and acceleration demands in multi-storey cross-laminated timber buildings A realistic estimation of seismic shear demands is essential for the design and assessment of multi-storey buildings and for ensuring the activation of ductile failure modes during strong ground-motion. Likewise, the evaluation of seismic floor accelerations is fundamental to the appraisal of damage to non-structural elements and building contents. Given the relative novelty of tall timber buildings and their increasing popularity, a rigorous evaluation of their shear and acceleration demands is all the more critical and timely. For this purpose, this paper investigates the scaling of seismic shear and acceleration demands in multi-storey cross-laminated timber (CLT) buildings and its dependency on various structural properties. Special attention is given to the influence of the frequency content of the ground-motion. A set of 60 CLT buildings of varying heights representative of a wide range of structural configurations is subjected to a large dataset of 1656 real earthquake records. It is demonstrated that the mean period (Tm) of the ground-motion together with salient structural parameters such as building aspect ratio (λ), design force reduction factor (q) and panel subdivision (β) influence strongly the variation of base shear, storey shears and acceleration demands. Besides, robust regression models are used to assess and quantify the distribution of force and acceleration demands on CLT buildings. Finally, practical expressions for the estimation of base shears, inter-storey shears and peak floor accelerations are offered.

13552,"Toward performance-driven seismic risk monitoring for geothermal platforms: development of ad hoc fragility curves Earthquakes, despite being a mostly natural phenomenon, may also be induced by a wide range of anthropogenic activities such as mining, fluid injection and extraction, hydraulic fracturing and geothermal reservoir processes. In recent years, the occurrence of induced and triggered seismicity and its potential impact on the built environment have heightened both public concern and regulatory scrutiny, motivating the need for an integrated risk management framework. Non-standard monitoring approaches provide valuable tools for mitigating the risk associated with earthquakes. These solutions include the use of advanced sensors and the implementation of performance-based rapid response systems for infrastructure, as well as monitoring the structural response of buildings and infrastructure in real time. Such technical solutions can be further used for validating damage forecasts determined by probabilistic approaches. The goal of this study is to establish a performance-driven monitoring system for induced seismicity. For this purpose, it is necessary to integrate analytical fragility curves in real time. These fragility curves can be derived by simplified vulnerability models that require input obtained from advanced exposure-monitoring techniques. Considering the case of induced seismicity, this also requires the expected damage to refer to non-structural components. Hence, the derived fragility curves are based on the non-structural damage criteria of typical residences. Therefore, a new approach is presented for defining analytical fragility curves of traditional or historic masonry structures, which can be found in large numbers near the geothermal platforms considered in this work. © 2018, The Author(s).

19639,"Prediction of seismic-induced structural damage using artificial neural networks Contemporary methods for estimating the extent of seismic-induced damage to structures include the use of nonlinear finite element method (FEM) and seismic vulnerability curves. FEM is applicable when a small number of predetermined structures is to be assessed, but becomes inefficient for larger stocks. Seismic vulnerability curves enable damage estimation for classes of similar structures characterised by a small number of parameters, and typically use only one parameter to describe ground motion. Hence, they are unable to extend damage prognosis to wider classes of structures, e.g. buildings with a different number of storeys and/or bays, or capture the full complexity of the relationship between damage and seismic excitation parameters. Motivated by these shortcomings, this study presents a general method for predicting seismic-induced damage using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The approach was to describe both the structure and ground motion using a large number of structural and ground motion properties. The class of structures analysed were 2D reinforced concrete (RC) frames that varied in topology, stiffness, strength and damping, and were subjected to a suite of ground motions. Dynamic structural responses were simulated using nonlinear FEM analysis and damage indices describing the extent of damage calculated. Using the results of the numerical simulations, a mapping between the structural and ground motion properties and the damage indices was than established using an ANN. The performance of the ANN was assessed using several examples and the ANN was found to be capable of successfully predicting damage.

16853,"Development and evaluation of FLFAcs - A new Flood Loss Function for Australian commercial structures Commercial building flood losses significantly affect the Australian economy; however, there are not many models for commercial flood damage estimation and their results are not reliable. This study has attempted to derive and develop a new model (FLFAcs) for estimating the magnitude of direct damage on commercial structures. The FLFAcs - Flood Loss Function for Australian commercial structures, was calibrated using empirical data collected from the 2013 flood in Bundaberg, Australia, and considering the inherent uncertainty in the data sample. In addition, the newly derived model has been validated using a K-fold cross-validation procedure. The model performance has also been compared with the Flood Loss Estimation MOdel for the commercial sector (FLEMOcs) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) damage functions from overseas, as well as the ANUFLOOD damage model from Australia.The validation procedure shows very good results for FLFAcs performance (no bias and only five per cent mean absolute error). It also shows that ANUFLOOD, as Australia's most prevalently used commercial loss estimation model, is still subject to very high uncertainty. Hence, there is an immediate need for a project to build new depth-damage functions for commercial and industrial properties.Awareness of these issues is important for strategic decision-making in flood risk reduction and it could amplify the cognition of decision-makers and insurance companies about flood risk assessment in Australia. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

16365,"Contribution of insurance data to cost assessment of coastal flood damage to residential buildings: Insights gained from Johanna (2008) and Xynthia (2010) storm events There are a number of methodological issues involved in assessing damage caused by natural hazards. The first is the lack of data, due to the rarity of events and the widely different circumstances in which they occur. Thus, historical data, albeit scarce, should not be neglected when seeking to build ex-ante risk management models. This article analyses the input of insurance data for two recent severe coastal storm events, to examine what causal relationships may exist between hazard characteristics and the level of damage incurred by residential buildings. To do so, data was collected at two levels: from lists of about 4000 damage records, 358 loss adjustment reports were consulted, constituting a detailed damage database. The results show that for flooded residential buildings, over 75% of reconstruction costs are associated with interior elements, with damage to structural components remaining very localised and negligible. Further analysis revealed a high scatter between costs and water depth, suggesting that uncertainty remains high in drawing up damage functions with insurance data alone. Due to the paper format of the loss adjustment reports, and the lack of harmonisation between their contents, the collection stage called for a considerable amount of work. For future events, establishing a standardised process for archiving damage information could significantly contribute to the production of such empirical damage functions. Nevertheless, complementary sources of data on hazards and asset vulnerability parameters will definitely still be necessary for damage modelling; multivariate approaches, crossing insurance data with external material, should also be investigated more deeply. © 2013 Author(s).

17851,"Flood loss modelling with FLF-IT: a new flood loss function for Italian residential structures The damage triggered by different flood events costs the Italian economy millions of euros each year. This cost is likely to increase in the future due to climate variability and economic development. In order to avoid or reduce such significant financial losses, risk management requires tools which can provide a reliable estimate of potential flood impacts across the country. Flood loss functions are an internationally accepted method for estimating physical flood damage in urban areas. In this study, we derived a new flood loss function for Italian residential structures (FLF-IT), on the basis of empirical damage data collected from a recent flood event in the region of Emilia-Romagna. The function was developed based on a new Australian approach (FLFA), which represents the confidence limits that exist around the parameterized functional depth-damage relationship. After model calibration, the performance of the model was validated for the prediction of loss ratios and absolute damage values. It was also contrasted with an uncalibrated relative model with frequent usage in Europe. In this regard, a threefold cross-validation procedure was carried out over the empirical sample to measure the range of uncertainty from the actual damage data. The predictive capability has also been studied for some sub-classes of water depth. The validation procedure shows that the newly derived function performs well (no bias and only 10% mean absolute error), especially when the water depth is high. Results of these validation tests illustrate the importance of model calibration. The advantages of the FLF-IT model over other Italian models include calibration with empirical data, consideration of the epistemic uncertainty of data, and the ability to change parameters based on building practices across Italy.

17907,"Fragility Analysis of Base-Isolated Liquid Storage Tanks under Random Sinusoidal Base Excitation Using Generalized Polynomial Chaos Expansion-Based Simulation Generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansion-based simulation technique is used to investigate the influence of input parameter uncertainty, on peak response quantities and fragility curves of base-isolated liquid storage tanks. Unidirectional horizontal sinusoidal base excitation is considered to develop the fragility curves for the base-isolated liquid storage tanks. Extensively used laminated rubber bearing (LRB), with linear force-deformation behavior, is considered as the isolation system. The liquid storage tank is modeled using a widely accepted lumped mass model. The failure of the liquid storage tank is defined corresponding to the elastic buckling of the tank wall. The uncertainties are considered in the isolator parameters and in the base excitation. Considerable difference in the peak response estimation is observed when the input parameters are represented using different probability distributions, especially when the uncertainties are higher. It is also observed that when the uncertainties in the input parameters increase, probability of failure at given amplitude of the excitation increases. It is demonstrated that the probability of failure estimated using gPC expansion-based simulations closely matches the same obtained through the direct Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Significant influence of the time period of the isolation system is observed on the fragility curves of the base-isolated liquid storage tanks. However, isolation damping has a marginal effect on the fragility curves of the base-isolated liquid storage tanks.

16621,"Damage characteristic and field survey of the 2011 great east Japan tsunami in miyagi prefecture On March 11th, 2011, the Pacific coast of Japan was hit by a tsunami generated by the largest earthquake (M9.0) in the history of the country and causing a wide range of devastating damage. Using preliminary reported data from many sources, some topics such as tsunami fatality ratio and tsunami fragility curves for structural damage are discussed and compared with other countries. This paper aims to discuss the damage characteristics of this tsunami as well as its mechanism, as observed through field surveys conducted over the 4 months following the tsunami. The field survey covers 13 areas in the Miyagi prefecture from Kesennuma city in the northernmost region to Yamamoto town in the southernmost region. The arrival time of the first tsunami along the coastal areas in the Miyagi prefecture was confirmed by stopped clocks found during the survey. The damage mechanism of coastal structures such as breakwaters, seawalls, tsunami gates, and evacuation buildings was investigated and discussed. Damage characteristics for each area, i.e., urban areas, port, coastal structures, fisheries, and agricultural areas, were also summarized. The conclusions drawn from the data analysis suggest that experience and education (soft countermeasures) are important to reduce the loss of life, as shown for example in the Sanriku area. The field surveys indicate that wood and reinforced-concrete (RC) structures should be balanced to survive both earthquake and tsunami forces, and the structural design for buildings should be reconsidered after the example in Onagawa town. In addition, coastal structures for tsunami countermeasures (hard countermeasures) should be more properly designed for survival instead of becoming floating debris upon being overturned by a tsunami. The combination of both hard and soft measures is especially necessary for optimizing the outcomes following a great disaster. These recommendations should be taken into consideration in the reconstruction efforts for better tsunami countermeasures in the future. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company and Japan Society of Civil Engineers. field survey  Miyagi prefecture  The 2011 Great East Japan tsunami Coastal engineering  Earthquakes  Reinforced concrete  Structural analysis  Surveys  Underwater foundations  Agricultural areas  Coastal structures  Earthquake and tsunamis  Experience and educations  Field surveys  Fragility curves  Miyagi prefecture  Structural damages  Tsunamis",Damage characteristic and field survey of the 2011 great east Japan tsunami in miyagi prefecture,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.259782215751404,0.16467077159241922,0.020198574085310308,0.005390372391402878,Analytical
17356,"Empirical fragility curves: The effect of uncertainty in ground motion intensity Empirical fragility curves derived from large post-disaster databases with data aggregated at municipality-level, commonly make the assumption that the ground motion intensity level is known and is determined at the centroid of each municipality from a ground motion prediction equation. A flexible Bayesian framework is applied here to the 1980 Irpinia database to explore whether more complex statistical models that account for sources of uncertainty in the intensity can significantly change the shape of the fragility curves. Through this framework the effect of explicitly modelling the uncertainty in the intensity, the spatial correlation of its intra-event component and the uncertainty due to the scatter of the buildings in the municipality are investigated. The analyses showed that the results did not change substantively with increased model complexity or the choice of prior. Nonetheless, informed decisions should be based on the defensible modelling of the significant variability in the data between municipalities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd None Equations of motion  Motion estimation  Bayesian frameworks  Fragility curves  Ground motion intensities  Ground-motion prediction equations  Informed decision  Model complexity  Sources of uncertainty  Spatial correlations  Uncertainty analysis",Empirical fragility curves: The effect of uncertainty in ground motion intensity,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08392427496973902,0.18046778606815622,0.009140966113260776,0.02076023360187452,Empirical
22262,"Vulnerability Curves of Existing Italian Industrial Steel Buildings Designed Without Seismic Criteria The Italian earthquakes of the last 15 years highlighted the significant seismic vulnerability of industrial buildings, which represent structural typologies at high risk due to their noteworthy exposure. The paper concerns a parametric study on a class of Italian existing industrial steel buildings designed before 1980 without anti-seismic criteria. The choice of the specific class of warehouses is based on field surveys carried out filling the CARTIS-GL form in the municipality of Cercola, within the district of Naples. These buildings, having different geometrical dimensions, represent one of the most common steel industrial structures widespread in the Italian territory in those years. Five families of structural models, placed into different geographical areas, are designed with the calculation methods of the reference time. The seismic behaviour of the investigated industrial buildings is investigated through non-linear static analyses. The results allow to plot vulnerability curves to be compared to seismic fragility curves derived from literature research. The comparison among curves is useful to estimate the effectiveness of the literature studies, as well as to evaluate the seismic damages suffered by investigated structures under different earthquake levels. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

20707,"Seismic fragility of a tilt-up concrete building in the Central United States The focus of this investigation is a seismic performance evaluation conducted for a low-rise, tilt-up concrete building structure typical of those in the Central United States (U.S.). The case study building was selected as a representative Central U.S. structure. As a first step, the structure was represented using a simple two degree-of-freedom model. Linear dynamic analyses using synthetic ground motion records of varying intensity levels were used to assess the seismic vulnerability of the structure and to develop seismic fragility curves that relate the probability of exceeding a particular performance level to the earthquake intensity. The findings of this study provide information about the expected seismic performance of a common type of structure in Mid-America region and highlight the importance of adequate in-plane roof diaphragm strength and adequate connectivity between the roof diaphragm and concrete walls for lateral load transfer.

17989,"Fragility curves and loss functions for RC structural components with smooth rebars Fragility and loss functions are developed to predict damage and economic losses due to earthquake loading in Reinforced Concrete (RC) structural components with smooth rebars. The attention is focused on external/internal beam-column joints and ductile/brittle weak columns, designed for gravity loads only, using low-strength concrete and plain steel reinforcing bars. First, a number of damage states are proposed and linked deterministically with commonly employed methods of repair and related activities. Results from previous experimental studies are used to develop empirical relationships between damage states and engineering demand parameters, such as interstory and column drift ratios. Probability distributions are fit to the empirical data and the associated statistical parameters are evaluated using statistical methods. Repair costs for damaged RC components are then estimated based on detailed quantity survey of a number of pre-70 RC buildings, using Italian costing manuals. Finally, loss functions are derived to predict the level of monetary losses to individual RC components as a function of the experienced response demand. © 2016 Techno-Press, Ltd.

20712,"Seismic fragility of equipment and support structure in a unit of an oil complex Refineries and related industrial facility have shown vulnerable during the past earthquakes. Damage to such facility may have a great economical impact. Seismic risk assessment of such facility has a great role on making required decisions for management of risk such as retrofit, etc. This research aims to investigate the seismic vulnerability of each element of a unit of a refinery and their impact on the overall vulnerability of the unit. To this end, seismic risk assessment of equipment and support building as a section of a refinery is under study. In order to analyse seismic behaviour of the non-structural components, equipment have been assumed as block-type. Failure modes are selected based on damages caused by past earthquakes. Shear failure of bolts have been considered as failure mode of equipment. Peak ground acceleration is chosen as earthquake intensity measure. In order to develop seismic fragility curves, created models are subjected to sixty ground motion records, each scaled to multiple levels of intensity to perform incremental dynamic analysis using MATLAB software. Fragility curves of the oil unit indicate that performance of the entire unit after earthquake depends on the extent of failure in essential and hazardous equipment. © 2016 CURRAN-CONFERENCE.

12510,"A comparative study of empirical and analytical fragility functions for the assessment of tsunami building damage in Tumaco, Colombia A fragility function shows the building damage likelihood based on a demand parameter such as the tsunami flow depth. While empirical fragility functions have been developed by using postdisaster damage survey data, regions with no recent tsunami damage cannot develop these estimations. Alternatively, analytical fragility functions could be developed to fill this gap. Along the Colombian Pacific coast, several tsunami events have occurred; however, the aftermath resulting from the structure physical damage was not recorded. Fortunately, other regions of the have collected tsunami damage information, which has been analyzed and represented in terms of empirical fragility functions. This paper provides a comparative study of empirical and analytical tsunami fragility functions. It is focused on the analytical fragility functions developed for typical structures in Tumaco, Colombia and on empirical fragility curves taken from damage survey data of recent tsunami events. The differences in the assessments of the damage produced by the two methods in the case of a two-story reinforced concrete building in Tumaco is discussed herein. As a result of the comparison, it was shown that the structures in Tumaco have higher collapse probabilities at lower flow depths than structures in other places along the Pacific and Indian Oceans. © 2020 Japan Society of Civil Engineers. analytical fragility curves  empirical fragility curves  nonlinear structural analysis  Tsunami damage Concrete buildings  Reinforced concrete  Surveys  Tsunamis  Collapse probabilities  Comparative studies  Fragility curves  Fragility function  Nonlinear structural analysis  Physical damages  Tsunami damages  Typical structures  Damage detection","A comparative study of empirical and analytical fragility functions for the assessment of tsunami building damage in Tumaco, Colombia",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,Analytical
18262,"How useful are complex flood damage models? We investigate the usefulness of complex flood damage models for predicting relative damage to residential buildings in a spatial and temporal transfer context. We apply eight different flood damage models to predict relative building damage for five historic flood events in two different regions of Germany. Model complexity is measured in terms of the number of explanatory variables which varies from 1 variable up to 10 variables which are singled out from 28 candidate variables. Model validation is based on empirical damage data, whereas observation uncertainty is taken into consideration. The comparison of model predictive performance shows that additional explanatory variables besides the water depth improve the predictive capability in a spatial and temporal transfer context, i.e., when the models are transferred to different regions and different flood events. Concerning the trade-off between predictive capability and reliability the model structure seem more important than the number of explanatory variables. Among the models considered, the reliability of Bayesian network-based predictions in space-time transfer is larger than for the remaining models, and the uncertainties associated with damage predictions are reflected more completely. © 2014.

18939,"Modelling multi-hazard hurricane damages on an urbanized coast with a Bayesian Network approach Hurricane flood impacts to residential buildings in coastal zones are caused by a number of hazards, such as inundation, overflow currents, erosion, and wave attack. However, traditional hurricane damage models typically make use of stage-damage functions, where the stage is related to flooding depth only. Moreover, these models are deterministic and do not consider the large amount of uncertainty associated with both the processes themselves and with the predictions. This uncertainty becomes increasingly important when multiple hazards (flooding, wave attack, erosion, etc.) are considered simultaneously. This paper focusses on establishing relationships between observed damage and multiple hazard indicators in order to make better probabilistic predictions. The concept consists of (1) determining Local Hazard Indicators (LHIs) from a hindcasted storm with use of a nearshore morphodynamic model, XBeach, and (2) coupling these LHIs and building characteristics to the observed damages. We chose a Bayesian Network approach in order to make this coupling and used the LHIs 'Inundation depth', 'Flow velocity', 'Wave attack', and 'Scour depth' to represent flooding, current, wave impacts, and erosion related hazards.The coupled hazard model was tested against four thousand damage observations from a case site at the Rockaway Peninsula, NY, that was impacted by Hurricane Sandy in late October, 2012. The model was able to accurately distinguish 'Minor damage' from all other outcomes 95% of the time and could distinguish areas that were affected by the storm, but not severely damaged, 68% of the time. For the most heavily damaged buildings ('Major Damage' and 'Destroyed'), projections of the expected damage underestimated the observed damage. The model demonstrated that including multiple hazards doubled the prediction skill, with Log-Likelihood Ratio test (a measure of improved accuracy and reduction in uncertainty) scores between 0.02 and 0.17 when only one hazard is considered and a score of 0.37 when multiple hazards are considered simultaneously. The LHIs with the most predictive skill were 'Inundation depth' and 'Wave attack'. The Bayesian Network approach has several advantages over the market-standard stage-damage functions: the predictive capacity of multiple indicators can be combined; probabilistic predictions can be obtained, which include uncertainty; and quantitative as well as descriptive information can be used simultaneously. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

18835,"Mechanical-analytical soil-dependent fragility curves of existing rc frames with column-driven failures In seismic risk estimation, among the different types of fragility curves used (judgement-based, mechanical, empirical/observational, hybrid), the mechanical ones have the twofold ad-vantage of allowing a better control over the basic parameters and of representing a validation test of the consistency of empirical/observational ones. In this study, fragility curves of RC frames with column-driven failures are obtained from a simplified analytical pushover method implemented in a simple spreadsheet, thus allowing the user to perform a large number of analyses. More im-portantly, the proposed method introduces the concept that Limit States at the structural level are obtained consequent to the attainment of the same Limit States at the local level, in the columns’ sections. This avoids using additional criteria, such as interstorey drift thresholds. This simple analytical model allows for rapid development of fragility curves, for any Limit State, of different building typologies identified by a set of global quantities (number of storeys, story heights, number of spans and span lengths) and by a set of local quantities (element sizes, reinforcement, and material properties). It also allows for a straightforward treatment of the influence of the soil class on the fragility curves parameters, which is another critical issue addressed in this work that helps when interpreting some literature results using empirical/observational methods. © 2021 by the author.

19495,"Performance-based seismic fragility analysis of RC frame structures The traditional research of structural vulnerability of RC structures mostly focuses on seismic intensity or peak ground acceleration (PGA). The selection of ground motions did not considered the difference between near-field and far-field earthquakes, and the research on building construction is less. Therefore, comprehensively considering the peak ground acceleration and damping ratio of 5% of the spectral acceleration, considering the different natures of near-field and far-field ground motions, fragility analysis on some RC frame structures was did. Four ultimate damage states for entire structure were defined, and based on the definition, a method for solving the limit values of the four performance levels was put forward. Finally, based on the results of incremental dynamic analysis (IDA), the performance-based seismic fragility analysis was carried out using this method, and fragility curves were derived to assess and compare the seismic performances under different IM parameters and different ground motions. According to the actual seismic demand of the structure, it can determine the damage states from the sense of probability, and provide a reference for future seismic damage prediction.

21081,"Seismic vulnerability analysis of rc buildings: Case study of Ibn Khaldoun area in Boumerdes city, Algeria This study focuses on empirical assessment of vulnerability and fragility curves of existing reinforced concrete (RC) buildings in Ibn Khaldoun area of Boumerdes city (Algeria). In this area, existing RC buildings experienced significant damage during the 2003 Boumerdes earthquake. Currently, the area includes existing non-damaged buildings, strengthened buildings and new RC buildings constructed in place of those demolished. The proposed seismic vulnerability assessment method combines the GNDT (Gruppo Nazionale per la Difesa dai Terremoti) II level method and the macroseismic method by means of correlation between the peak ground acceleration PGA and the macroseismic intensity I. For this purpose, data was collected by investigating buildings within the area. Structural and non-structural building characteristics were identified and statistical analysis was performed. Resulting vulnerability curves obtained using the macroseismic method were expressed as a function of macroseismic intensity and the vulnerability index obtained using the GNDT II level method. Fragility curves, obtained by using correlation between the peak ground acceleration PGA and the macroseismic intensity I, showed that the highest probability to reach or exceed a very heavy damage grade is obtained for the highest values of I and vulnerability index V.

18159,"Generation of spectrum-compatible acceleration time history for Nepal The 25 April 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal caused severe structural damage in central Nepal, including the capital city Kathmandu. Both seismic vulnerability analysis of affected buildings and nonlinear time history analysis need increasing time history. However, no adequate records are available in Nepal, thus structural engineering practices follow Indian guidelines. The Nepal building code allows time history analysis along with the seismic coefficient and response spectrum methods, so nonlinear time history analysis can be used to assure adequate seismic safety. To fulfill the gap of recorded accelerograms, we developed artificial acceleration time histories considering the seismic hazard model of Chaulagain et al. (2015). We compared the synthetic accelerograms developed in this study with the records of Gorkha earthquake; the recorded maximum peak ground acceleration during the Gorkha earthquake showed comparable acquaintance only to the peak amplitudes of synthetic accelerograms generated for 300- and 475-year return periods.

21878,"The structural role played by masonry infills on RC building performances after the 2011 Lorca, Spain, earthquake On May 11, 2011 an earthquake of magnitude 5.1 Mw struck Murcia region causing nine casualties and damage to buildings and infrastructures. Even if the main characteristics of the event would classify it as a moderate earthquake, the maximum Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) registered (equal to 0.37 g) exceeded significantly local code provisions in terms of hazard at the site. This high PGA was a result of directivity effects in the near source region. An overview of earthquake characteristics and damage observed is provided. Notwithstanding the lack of proper structural design characterizing building stock in the area, most of the losses were caused by non-structural damage. According to in field observations, it emerges that masonry infills provided additional, “not designed”, strength to reinforced concrete (RC) buildings. Observed damage data, collected after the earthquake, are shown and compared to the results of a simplified approach for nonstructural damage assessment of RC infilled structures (FAST vulnerability approach). The latter comparison provided a fair accordance between observed data and analytical results. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

22250,"Vulnerability assessment of reinforced concrete buildings at precarious slopes subjected to combined ground shaking and earthquake induced landslide At present, the seismic vulnerability of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings standing in the vicinity of the slope's crest is assessed ignoring, in most cases, the effect of topography and the potential slope instability. This study aspires to investigate these effects by proposing a methodological framework for assessing the vulnerability of typical RC buildings subjected to combined ground shaking and earthquake induced landslide hazards. The method is based on a two-step numerical analysis procedure. First, the acceleration time histories and the permanent differential ground displacement time histories are evaluated employing dynamic non-linear analysis. Then, a series of nonlinear dynamic and static time history analyses are performed for a reference low rise, code-conforming RC frame building located at varying distances from the slope's crest to compute the fragility curves for the two loading conditions i.e. ground shaking considering topographic amplification and seismic permanent landslide displacements. The derived fragility curves, described as a function of peak ground acceleration (PGA) at the rock outcrop, are compared to provide insight into the primary damage mechanism while, in the end, coupled fragility curves are generated to account for the combined potential damages due to ground shaking and seismically induced landslide considering or not the interaction between the two hazards.

17943,Fragility analysis of wide-beam infill-joist block RC frames Purpose: The purpose of the presented study is to develop fragility curves for the wide-beam infill-joist block reinforced concrete structures. Theory and Methods: Nonlinear time history analyses are performed for the set of selected ground motions. The performance levels are identified through pushover analysis and fragility curves are produced for ground motion parameters. Results: Fragility curves obtained for the wide-beam RC frames presents a different characteristic than the curves obtained for the conventional frames. Conclusion: Results show that wide-beam RC frame buildings are seismically more vulnerable than the conventional deep beam RC frame buildings based on structural models with similar properties. The possible reason seems to be low lateral stiffness of wide-beam frames that causes large lateral drift demands and therefore severe damage at the wide-beam column connections.

18838,"Mechanism based assessment of damage-dependent fragility curves for RC building classes Seismic fragility curves play a critical role in risk assessment because they represent the probability of attaining different damage states given the ground motion intensity. However, in case of repeated earthquakes, the seismic vulnerability of buildings varies due to damage and this shall be properly considered for the realistic estimate of evolving seismic risk during a seismic sequence. This paper presents a methodology for the assessment of damage-dependent fragility curves for existing reinforced concrete (RC) building classes. The derivation of fragility curves is based on a hybrid method that combines observational based â€œempiricalâ€ curves and mechanical based assessment of buildingsâ€™ residual capacity (REC), that is a measure of seismic capacity, which may be reduced due to seismic damage. A mechanism based procedure to assess building REC, and its variation for increasing ductility demand, is presented. Then, in order to be able to apply such procedure to RC building classes, a simulated design procedure is implemented that allows the automatic design of elements dimensions and reinforcement, as well as the characterization of the building nonlinear model needed for mechanism based analysis. Applying a Monte Carlo simulation procedure the geometric, structural and mechanical parameters, from which the design depends on, are varied according to representative distributions and populations of building models are generated and analyzed with mechanism based approach. The procedure is implemented for buildings that are prone to first storey mechanism and is applied for existing RC building classes in Lâ€™Aquila. Â© 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

19754,"Probabilistic Models Significantly Reduce Uncertainty in Hurricane Harvey Pluvial Flood Loss Estimates Pluvial flood risk is mostly excluded in urban flood risk assessment. However, the risk of pluvial flooding is a growing challenge with a projected increase of extreme rainstorms compounding with an ongoing global urbanization. Considered as a flood type with minimal impacts when rainfall rates exceed the capacity of urban drainage systems, the aftermath of rainfall-triggered flooding during Hurricane Harvey and other events show the urgent need to assess the risk of pluvial flooding. Due to the local extent and small-scale variations, the quantification of pluvial flood risk requires risk assessments on high spatial resolutions. While flood hazard and exposure information is becoming increasingly accurate, the estimation of losses is still a poorly understood component of pluvial flood risk quantification. We use a new probabilistic multivariable modeling approach to estimate pluvial flood losses of individual buildings, explicitly accounting for the associated uncertainties. Except for the water depth as the common most important predictor, we identified the drivers for having loss or not and for the degree of loss to be different. Applying this approach to estimate and validate building structure losses during Hurricane Harvey using a property level data set, we find that the reliability and dispersion of predictive loss distributions vary widely depending on the model and aggregation level of property level loss estimates. Our results show that the use of multivariable zero-inflated beta models reduce the 90% prediction intervalsfor Hurricane Harvey building structure loss estimates on average by 78% (totalling U.S.$3.8 billion) compared to commonly used models. pluvial flooding  loss modeling  urban flooding  probabilistic  Hurricane Harvey  climate change adaptation CLIMATE-CHANGE  DAMAGE ASSESSMENT  RISK  REGRESSION  RAINFALL",Probabilistic Models Significantly Reduce Uncertainty in Hurricane Harvey Pluvial Flood Loss Estimates,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0788484143101734,0.13918984928238032,0.028177288243401884,0.024336127343511947,Empirical
21806,"The Influence of Velocity on Vulnerability of Building Structure to Debris Flow In order to understand the possible loss of building structure to debris flow, the establishment of vulnerability is necessary. With vulnerability, the loss can be calculated. This study followed HAZUS damage state probabilities concept to establish the fragility curves of building structure under debris flow impact. It indicates the relationship of damage state probability and spectral displacement related to velocity and inundation height. In this study, the assuming inundation height and velocity were taken to establish the fragility curves, and fragility curves were integrated into a unitary curve as a proxy of vulnerability of building structure with inundation height as X-axis and loss ratio as Y-axis. In this study, the brick structure type building in Taiwan was chosen to demonstrate the concept. The vulnerabilities and possible (predicted) loss ratio of brick structure could be established under various combinations of inundation height and velocity (ranging from 2 to 20 m/s). © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

15301,"A probabilistic approach to estimating residential losses from different flood types Residential assets, comprising buildings and household contents, are a major source of direct flood losses. Existing damage models are mostly deterministic and limited to particular countries or flood types. Here, we compile building-level losses from Germany, Italy and the Netherlands covering a wide range of fluvial and pluvial flood events. Utilizing a Bayesian network (BN) for continuous variables, we find that relative losses (i.e. loss relative to exposure) to building structure and its contents could be estimated with five variables: water depth, flow velocity, event return period, building usable floor space area and regional disposable income per capita. The model’s ability to predict flood losses is validated for the 11 flood events contained in the sample. Predictions for the German and Italian fluvial floods were better than for pluvial floods or the 1993 Meuse river flood. Further, a case study of a 2010 coastal flood in France is used to test the BN model’s performance for a type of flood not included in the survey dataset. Overall, the BN model achieved better results than any of 10 alternative damage models for reproducing average losses for the 2010 flood. An additional case study of a 2013 fluvial flood has also shown good performance of the model. The study shows that data from many flood events can be combined to derive most important factors driving flood losses across regions and time, and that resulting damage models could be applied in an open data framework. © 2020, The Author(s).

17854,"Flood risk analyses-how detailed do we need to be? Applied flood risk analyses, especially in urban areas, very often pose the question how detailed the analysis needs to be in order to give a realistic figure of the expected risk. The methods used in research and practical applications range from very basic approaches with numerous simplifying assumptions up to very sophisticated, data and calculation time demanding applications both on the hazard and on the vulnerability part of the risk. In order to shed some light on the question of required model complexity in flood risk analyses and outputs sufficiently fulfilling the task at hand, a number of combinations of models of different complexity both on the hazard and on the vulnerability side were tested in a case study. The different models can be organized in a model matrix of different complexity levels: On the hazard side, the approaches/models selected were (A) linear interpolation of gauge water levels and intersection with a digital elevation model (DEM), (B) a mixed 1D/2D hydraulic model with simplifying assumptions (LISFLOOD-FP) and (C) a Saint-Venant 2D zero-inertia hyperbolic hydraulic model considering the built environment and infrastructure. On the vulnerability side, the models used for the estimation of direct damage to residential buildings are in order of increasing complexity: (I) meso-scale stage-damage functions applied to CORINE land cover data, (II) the rule-based meso-scale model FLEMOps+ using census data on the municipal building stock and CORINE land cover data and (III) a rule-based micro-scale model applied to a detailed building inventory. Besides the inundation depths, the latter two models consider different building types and qualities as well as the level of private precaution and contamination of the floodwater. The models were applied in a municipality in east Germany, Eilenburg. It suffered extraordinary damage during the flood of August 2002, which was well documented as were the inundation extent and depths. These data provide an almost unique data set for the validation of flood risk analyses. The analysis shows that the combination of the 1D/2D model and the meso-scale damage model FLEMOps+ performed best and provide the best compromise between data requirements, simulation effort, and an acceptable accuracy of the results. The more detailed approaches suffered from complex model set-up, high data requirements, and long computation times.

19684,"Probabilistic assessment of structural seismic damage for buildings in mid-america This paper provides an approach to conduct a probabilistic assessment of structural damage due to seismic events with an application to typical building structures in Mid-America. The developed methodology includes modified damage state classifications based on the ATC-13 and ATC-38 damage states and the ATC-38 database of building damage. Damage factors are assigned to each damage state to quantify structural damage as a percentage of structural replacement cost. To account for the inherent uncertainties, these factors are expressed as random variables with a Beta distribution. A set of fragility curves, quantifying the structural vulnerability of a building, is mapped onto the developed methodology to determine the expected structural damage. The total structural damage factor for a given seismic intensity is then calculated using a probabilistic approach. Prediction and confidence bands are also constructed to account for the prevailing uncertainties. The expected seismic structural damage is assessed for a typical building structure in the Mid-America region using the developed methodology. The developed methodology provides a transparent procedure, where the structural damage factors can be updated as additional seismic damage data becomes available. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.

19643,"Predictive applications of Australian flood loss models after a temporal and spatial transfer In recent decades, considerably greater flood losses have increased attention to flood risk evaluation. This study used data-sets collected from Queensland flood events and investigated the predictive capacity of three new Australian flood loss models to assess the extent of physical damages, after a temporal and spatial transfer. The models' predictive power is tested for precision, variation, and reliability. The performance of a new Australian flood loss function was contrasted with two tree-based damage models, one pruned and one un-pruned. The tree-based models are grown based on the interaction of flood loss ratio with 13 examined predictors gathered from flood specifications, building characteristics, and mitigation actions. Besides an overall comparison, the prediction capacity is also checked for some sub-classes of water depth and some groups of building-type.It has been shown that considering more details of the flood damage process can improve the predictive capacity of damage prediction models. In this regard, complexity with parameters with low predictive power may lead to more uncertain results. On the other hand, it has also been demonstrated that the probability analysis approach can make damage models more reliable when they are subjected to use in different flooding events.

19810,"Probabilistic Seismic Safety Assessment of Chinese RC Frame Structures Using Fragility Curves A simulation-based procedure was adopted to generate fragility curves for five Chinese code-conforming reinforced concrete (RC) frame structures with increasing design-based earthquake (DBE) intensities. Two important elements, namely probabilistic seismic demand analysis (PSDA) and probabilistic seismic capacity analysis (PSCA), were involved in the procedure. In PSDA, 100 real ground motion records were selected to perform nonlinear time history analyses for representing the influence of earthquake uncertainties on structural demands. In PSCA, a group of ten structural parameters were considered as random, and then the conventional (deterministic) pushover analysis was extended by introducing 100 building samples according to the principle of the Latin hypercube sampling technique. From the derived pushover curves, the thresholds corresponding to the limit states -namely, ""slight damage"", ""moderate damage"", ""extensive damage"" and ""complete damage"" -were obtained for statistics. Finally, fragility curves were generated through combining the results of PSDA and PSCA, and the exceeding probabilities of the example frames conditioned on the three mostly concerned earthquake levels, i.e. frequent earthquake (FE), DBE and maximum considered earthquake (MCE), were consequently calculated. The results show that the increase of fortification earthquake intensity cannot correspondingly promote the probabilistic safety level. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

20099,"Residential Flood Loss Assessment and Risk Mapping from High-Resolution Simulation Since the patterns of residential buildings in the urban area are small-sized and dispersed, this study proposes a high-resolution flood loss and risk assessment model to analyze the direct loss and risk impacts caused by floods. The flood inundation simulation with a fine digital elevation model (DEM) provides detailed estimations of flood-inundated areas and their corresponding inundation depths during the 2016 Typhoon Megi and 2017 Typhoon Haitang. The flood loss assessment identifies the impacts of both events on residential areas. The depth-damage table from surveys in the impacted area was applied. Results indicated that the flood simulation with the depth-damage table is an effective way to assess the direct loss of a flood disaster. The study also showed the effects of spatial resolution on the residential loss. The results indicated that the low-resolution model easily caused the estimated error of loss in dispersed residential areas when compared with the high-resolution model. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP), as a multi-criteria decision-making method, was used to identify the weight factor for each vulnerability factor. The flood-vulnerable area was mapped using natural and social vulnerability factors, such as high-resolution DEM, distance to river, distance to fire station, and population density. Eventually, the flood risk map was derived from the vulnerability and flood hazard maps to present the risk level of the flood disaster in the residential areas. flood  3Di  loss assessment  analytic hierarchy process (AHP)  risk map DAMAGE ASSESSMENT  IMPACT  UNCERTAINTY  HAZARD  MODEL",Residential Flood Loss Assessment and Risk Mapping from High-Resolution Simulation,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17260240378277963,0.046041108231011575,0.020302917179093126,0.010449120597220031,Analytical
20112,"Resilience and Vulnerability Analysis for Restoration After Tsunamis and Floods: The Case of Dwellings and Industrial Plants The resilience approach represents a unified and integrated framework for the restoration process following disasters. Under given resilience parameters values, a resilient system is able to recover and be strengthened within a defined recovery period; otherwise, it is a non-resilient system. This chapter considers different structures and focuses on several parameters which govern resilience together with their mechanical vulnerability under various hazards. A new method of theoretically measuring resilience, its link with mechanical vulnerability, and its sensitivity analysis are investigated for dwellings and industrial plants under the effects of flood and tsunami hazards: - Non-designed (informal) masonry constructions under the effects of a flooding hazard: vulnerability is estimated after a rapid inspection by qualified engineers. Fragility curves are developed and the structural failure risk is calculated and mapped depending on the intensity of the hazard: water height and flow velocity, in a real case. - Structural and non-structural waste generated by flooding: relevant models are adopted and used for predicting expected quantities of waste. The territory may take several years to recover since generated waste may represent several times annual quantities produced under normal circumstances. - Coastal industrial plants under the effects of a tsunami hazard: structural failure in tanks results from buoyancy (uplift), overturning, sliding by shear effect, excessive bending, or buckling. Vulnerability and fragility curves are developed for various tanks of small and large sizes.

This procedure is part of a methodological proposal which includes specific studies on expected seismic inputs and site effects analyses. The procedure is based on a simplified collection of data, such as typological features and factors concerning the seismic behaviour of buildings, and provides an estimate of seismic vulnerability and an expected damage forecast using fragility curves. The instruments and methods used for the Celano project are an updated and improved version of those applied to previous vulnerability investigations. This paper demonstrates how this procedure can meet the objectives of the integrated methodology proposed.

20644,"Seismic fragility assessment of RC moment-resisting frames designed according to the current Chinese seismic design code Seismic fragility was assessed for 72 RC moment-resisting frame building structures designed according to the current Chinese seismic design code for buildings, taking into account the uncertainty of the structural material strength and earthquake ground motions. The site soil type, the number of stories, and the seismic protection intensity were considered to be the main design variables of the reference structures. Fragilities for four damage levels, i.e., fully operational, operational, repairable, and collapse prevention, are developed in this study. The global seismic damage index, which reflects the effects of individual structural components, and the maximum inter-story drift ratio, which is closely related to the seismic damage of structural and non-structural components, was employed as the damage identifiers. For each frame structure, the probability of exceeding each damage level in an earthquake with a specified PGA was determined by conducting nonlinear time history analysis. Fragility curves for the four damage levels were derived by regression analysis using the nonlinear least-squares method. The structural reliability of RC frames against earthquakes was examined using the developed fragility curves. The results indicate that seismic performance objectives for RC frame structures designed in accordance with the current Chinese code can be achieved with good reliability.

17220,"Effect of roof garden weight on the seismic fragility of relatively tall concrete wall buildings In line with rapid urbanization and the urgent need for the development of Malaysia, the number of tall buildings in this country has increased drastically over the past decades. However, most of the existing structures have not been designed for earthquake resistance. Therefore, this study focused on the analytical derivation of seismic fragility curves for concrete wall buildings with a roof garden. Two 25-story residential high-rise buildings with a similar architectural plan and number of stories but with different parking levels were subjected to 15 far-field earthquake records. Pushover and incremental dynamic analyses were employed to estimate the inter-story drift capacities and demands. A comparison between the results obtained from this study and those presented by other researchers showed that the additional mass of the roof garden significantly increased the probability of collapse; however, it had an insignificant impact on the probability of exceeding minor damage. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Three frames were analyzed with capacity design concepts taking into account shear capacity, flexural capacity and contribution from floor reinforcement to beams. Maximum inter-story drift ratios obtained from time-history analyses are plotted against ground motion intensities.

21258,"Seismic vulnerability of URM structures based on a Discrete Macro-Element Modeling (DMEM) approach The assessment of the seismic vulnerability of unreinforced masonry (URM) structures based on numerical modeling constitutes a difficult task due to their complex behavior, especially in the nonlinear dynamic field, and the lack of suitable, low-demanding, computational tools. In the last decades, practical statistical tools for the derivation of fragility curves have been successfully proposed mainly with reference to framed structures. This approach has been adopted also for the seismic vulnerability assessment of masonry buildings focusing on the in-plane collapse mechanisms by means of equivalent frame models. Nevertheless, the lack of computationally effective tools which involve the interaction between in-plane and out-of-plane mechanisms makes the definition of fragility curves an arduous task when it comes to existing masonry structures without box behavior. In this paper, a practical and thorough methodology for the assessment of the seismic vulnerability of URM buildings by means of analytical fragility curves is presented. This methodology presents some innovative features such as the definition of the Limit States (LSs) and their corresponding capacity based on multi-directional pushover analyses, as well as the application of nonlinear dynamic analyses, performed using a discrete macro-element modelling approach capable of simulating the main in-plane and out-of-plane responses of URM structures with a reduced computational burden. The present investigation focuses on the application of this methodology for assessing the seismic vulnerability of a brick masonry structure characterized by a strong out-of-plane failure mechanism.

16210,"Collapse Risks of Fail-Safe RC Frames Due to Earthquakes: Fragility Assessments The objective of this study was to determine the collapse risk of fail-safe reinforced concrete (RC) frames due to earthquakes by newly developed fragility curves. The curves were constructed based on the collapse mechanism, instead of measures of lateral drift as customarily adopted. The procedure was applied to RC open frames that were seismic resistant. A fail-safe mechanism was imposed by allowing plastic hinges to be formed mainly in the beams. This automatically satisfied the stronger column-weaker beam requirement; shear failure was neither tolerated anywhere in the columns nor in the beams. Two kinds of fail-safe RC frames were investigated: special moment resisting frames (SMF) and ordinary moment resisting frames (OMF). Their earthquake collapse risk was computed and compared. Inelastic time history (NLTH) and the non-linear static procedure (NSP) were conducted to assess their structural performance. The results showed among others that the fail-safe OMF had lower collapse risk than the fail-safe SMF. The collapse prevention performance level in NLTH could only be achieved for the fail-safe frames. The non-linear time history analysis should be the only method used for seismic reevaluation/safety checking of building frame structures. collapse risk  earthquake  fail-safe reinforced concrete frame  fragility  NSP  time history CURVES  CONCRETE",Collapse Risks of Fail-Safe RC Frames Due to Earthquakes: Fragility Assessments,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.794629435734405,0.030546795848149427,0.005346330746951512,0.016126239899428053,Analytical
22051,"Uncertainties in flood risk mapping: A case study on estimating building damages for a river flood in Finland In our review of recent flood risk mapping approaches in Europe, we noted that the sources of uncertainty were rarely questioned. We demonstrated potential sources of uncertainty in flood risk mapping of buildings using a case study of a spring flood in 2005, in Kittilä, Finland. One- and two-dimensional hydraulic models of the flood corresponded well with the actual inundation. The initial modelling result of the inundated buildings differed considerably from reality, but this could be improved through modelling performed with more diverse building elevation data. The accuracy of the digital terrain model is a key determinant in the accuracy of flood hazard modelling. An exposure analysis of buildings is often utilized by an overlay analysis of map layers representing both the flood and the buildings. However, we indicated that the analysis may be partly hindered by the characteristics and inaccuracies of the building datasets used and the modelled flood. In flood damage modelling, the average damages calculated from the database were used, as empirical damage data were too general for a detailed flood damage assessment. Damage modelling with empirical and synthetic damage data could be made more reliable through better archiving of actual flood damages and by performing more diverse damage estimates of standard buildings. © 2010 The Authors.

22001,"Tsunami hazard and building damage assessment in Thailand using numerical model and fragility curves Assessing the hazard and damage of a potential tsunami is an ongoing challenge in tsunami research. This study begins by simulating tsunami hazards using historical events. A tsunami propagation model is used to obtain the estimated maximum tsunami height along the west coast of Thailand for a rough return period, and rupture locations that have the potential to generate catastrophic tsunamis in Thailand for a specific return period are proposed. A tsunami inundation model is then performed to quantify each building's maximum inundation depth, using high-resolution satellite images to extract each building's location for the areas of interest located in southern Thailand. Nam Khem village and Patong beach are selected as study areas to represent village communities and tourist attractions, respectively. The model results are then used to obtain the numbers of exposed inhabitants and buildings for each earthquake return period. The developed tsunami fragility curves are applied to these figures to determine the number of potentially damaged buildings. The analysis suggests that the propagation model can be used to obtain rough estimations because it provided results similar to those of the inundation model.

12758,"Derivation of fragility curves at design stage through linear time-history analysis The aim of this work is to open up new opportunities for designers towards a performance-based approach to derive fragilities at design stage. Nonlinear Time-History Analysis (NTHA) represents the current practice for the estimation of damage within the Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering (PBEE) framework. Among the NTHA approaches for fragility assessment, Cloud Analysis (CA) represents a convenient tool which allows evaluating the parameters of the conditional demand distribution based on simple regression of cloud-dispersed data points obtained from recorded ground motions. Notwithstanding the growth in computer processing power and software development, NTHA is generally time-consuming and it requires advanced expertise in nonlinear modelling, preventing its use in the professional field at design stage. Herein, a novel procedure for deriving fragility curves built up through Linear Time-History Analysis (LTHA) and CA is presented. It can be employed within a simplified PBEE approach at design stage for performance comparison of design solutions. Differences between LTHA results and those obtained through NTHA are compared for the assessment of a 12-storey Reinforced-Concrete Moment-Resisting-Frame building designed according to Eurocode 8. Assessment is performed for two limit states: Life Safety- and Damage Limitation- Limit State. Critical aspects for LTHA-based fragility assessment such as (i) influence of ground motion suite size and (ii) identification of “unacceptable cases” are investigated.

17874,"Florida public hurricane loss projection vulnerability model: Implementation and validation This paper presents vulnerability component of the Florida Public Hurricane Loss Projection Model developed at the request of the Florida Department of Financial Services. This is one of the first public models entirely accessible for scrutiny to the scientific community. The model incorporates state -of-theart techniques in hurricane prediction, and vulnerability modeling based on engineering criteria. Although the model was developed for Florida, it is applic able to any hurricane prone region. The vulnerability model uses a Monte Carlo simulation based on a component approach to determine the external vulnerability of buildings at various wind speeds. The building internal and contents damage, as well as the additional living expenses, are then extrapolated from the external damage. The resulting estimates of total building damage results in the formulation of vulnerability matrices for each statistically significant building type in the Florida building stock. The process is repeated for three categories of building, weak, medium, and strong, representing different construction practices over the years. The damage model is complemented by estimates of appurtenant structures damage. Results obtained by using the model are validated against actual claim data provided by insurance companies.

17502,"Evaluation of economic loss for structures in the area struck by the 7/9/1999 Athens earthquake and comparison with actual repair costs Reliable loss assessment (in monetary terms) for buildings struck by an earthquake is an essential factor in the development of seismic risk scenarios for a given urban area. The evaluation of the seismic risk for a certain region depends both on the seismic hazard and the vulnerability of the building stock in the area. For the evaluation of building vulnerability, a hybrid methodology was recently proposed for the estimation of vulnerability (fragility) curves and the corresponding damage probability matrices. The methodology is applied here to the municipality of Ano Liosia, in the meisoseismal area of the Athens, Greece earthquake of 7/9/1999, for both reinforced concrete (R/C) and unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings. An in-situ survey of 150 building blocks was performed, and data regarding the structural type, actual earthquake damage and corresponding repair costs were collected. The actual repair cost for the area was compared with the economic loss estimation obtained using the hybrid methodology and various estimates of the seismic action in the area considered. The analytical economic loss assessment was found to agree, to a satisfactory degree, with the actual repair costs, for certain seismic hazard scenarios. Â© 2005 WIT Press.

19811,"Probabilistic seismic vulnerability assessment of buildings in terms of economic losses The probabilistic seismic risk assessment in terms of economic losses for building portfolios aims to the estimation of the probability distribution functions (PDF) of economic losses for a set of stochastic events representing the seismic hazard at a particular geographic zone. This paper proposes a methodological approach to evaluate and integrate, in a consistent and rigorous way, the economic losses as a function of the seismic hazard intensity for prototype building constructions. Prototype building models are designed and characterized with a set of reference parameters. By means of 3D structural models, detailed nonlinear response history analyses are performed for a set of seismic records at several increasing intensities. Seismic records are selected to represent particular seismological and geotechnical conditions at the site of analysis. Then, a component-based model is conformed considering structural, non-structural, and content components potentially susceptible to damage. Each component type is assigned a fragility specification for various damage states in terms of costs and times of repair. Using Monte Carlo simulations, the different sources of uncertainty are included in the assessment of the costs and times of repair at different seismic intensities. Uncertainties in the hazard, model response, damage states, and costs and times of repair are considered. Aspects such as geographical variations in the hazard, scale economy, special commercial conditions, minimum or total intervention costs, and business interruption costs are included in the assessment. Finally, the results are represented by means of vulnerability functions for specific building typologies. To illustrate the methodology, a case study is presented in detail for a typical 5-story reinforced concrete moment resisting frame building designed for special seismic code level and located in a typical soft soil deposit of Bogotá, Colombia. Additional results are presented for six (6) different building typologies illustrating variations in results due to different story heights and seismic code levels. The resulting vulnerability functions are compared with equivalent results from other similar methodologies.

16374,"Correlation between strong motion indices and damage of wooden structures based on nonparametric statistics To propose more useful strong motion indices and to improve estimation accuracy of building damage, some strong motion indices (peak ground velocity, spectrum intensity, Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity, spectral displacement, etc.) are investigated with respect to correlation with damage of wooden structures. A nonparametric correlation coefficient, Spearman's Ρ, is employed as an indicator of accuracy of damage estimation. Multiple input motions are used for nonlinear time history analysis of two-degree-of-freedom models of wooden structures, which have various combinations of story stiffnesses. As a damage model, maximum story drift angle is considered and three levels of threshold, 1/60, 1/30 and 1/15 rad are examined, which approximately correspond to minor, moderate, and major damage of a structure. Distributions of Spearman's Ρof the strong motion indices are compared, and it is revealed that displacement response of a linear single-degree-of-freedom system with a damping ratio of 20% and with the elongated period that is determined by a damage threshold, shows fairly good correlation with the structural damage.

19267,"Observed damages in Pakistan due to 16 April 2013 Iran earthquake This paper presents the record of damages which were observed in Pakistan due to a strong earthquake on 16 April 2013 in Iran. Mashkel was the nearest town in Pakistan close to the epicentre of earthquake. The damages were documented by a survey team during the visit of Mashkel. The intensity of earthquake in most of the visited areas was found to be VIII on the Modified Mercalli Intensity scale. The infrastructure facilities were undamaged and were operating satisfactorily. On the other hand, heavy damage to adobe buildings was caused by the earthquake. Most of the building failure was resulted by the out-of-plane wall collapse; nearly 40 % adobe buildings were collapsed due to ground shaking in some of the affected areas. Reinforced concrete and cement concrete block masonry buildings performed better than adobe buildings. Using the data of building damage and earthquake intensity fragility curves for adobe buildings in Mashkel were developed. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

16935,"Development of seismic fragility curves for reinforced concrete tall buildings This study concentrates on the probabilistic risk assessment of reinforced concrete tall buildings subjected to ground motion excitation. In order to assess the vulnerability of tall buildings, twelve-, and twenty-four-story four-bay reinforced concrete moment resisting frames are studied. This evaluation is done through developing fragility curves. These fragility curves provide the probability of exceeding the multiple damage states for a given intensity (e.g. CAV) of ground motion excitation. To develop the fragility curves, a great number of nonlinear dynamic analyses are conducted in the opensource platform OpenSees. Since the PEER Guidelines for Performance-Based Seismic Design of tall buildings recommends to consider the effect of soil-structure interaction, SSI, in tall buildings using a response history substructure analysis of them, this study includes comparison between fragility curves of fixed base buildings and the ones derived from models considering the SSI effects to indicate the efficacy of that. The structural uncertainties are taken into account by generating and modeling random values of material properties using Monte Carlo simulation method. Former investigations show that considering uncertainty in soil properties such as friction angle, cohesion, density, shear modulus and Poisson's ratio makes a negligible difference in seismic demand, so we pass up this uncertainty. Four sets of seven earthquake accelerograms corresponding to type C & D soils (based on NEHRP classification) for far and near sources are selected to be used in the analysis. Finally the developed fragility curves can be used to assess the seismic performance of tall buildings and discern the effect of SSI, height of structures and soil type on seismic response of this type of structures. An increase in the probability of exceedance of different damage states is observed in the cases of considering SSI effects, type D soils and near-source accelerograms.

20614,"Seismic fragility assessment for reinforced concrete high-rise buildings in Southern Euro-Mediterranean zone This paper presents seismic fragility assessment of RC high rise-buildings for seismic excitation, typical for Southern Euro-Mediterranean zone. The fragility curves were derived and log-normal cumulative distribution function parameters were obtained for the four defined damage states by conducting 3600 nonlinear time-history analyses on the basis of 60 ground motions with wide range of magnitudes, distance to source and different site conditions, including in this way uncertainties during ground motion selection. As a prototype buildings, 20-story, 30-story and 40-story RC high-rise buildings with core wall structural system were chosen. The key points of the process for obtaining the fragility curves are shown by using algorithm, defined in this paper, and generally applicable to all types of RC high-rise buildings. For the purpose of conducting nonlinear time-history analyses, non-linear 3D models of the buildings were designed. A detailed probabilistic seismic damage analysis was done and as its result the limit states as well as corresponding damage states for RC high-rise buildings were defined, where the damage states were treated as random variables. Inter-storey drifts at threshold of damage state were defined as random variables with the range of possible values. Since no probabilistic fragility curves exist for this class of buildings and for this seismic zone, this work partially fills the void in Southern Euro-Mediterranean seismic risk assessment. The whole approach presented in this paper may be used for efficient obtaining probabilistic fragility curves for RC high-rise buildings of different configurations. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

16343,"Consideration of flow velocity in flood damage models [Berücksichtigung der Fließgeschwindigkeit bei Hochwasser-Schadensmodellen] Reliable prognoses of building damage caused by flood impact require realistic relationships between action and damage or loss describing parameters. Due to the fact that commonly applied damage functions are related to the different usage classes (i.e. private housing), the required differentiation according to the parameters on the resistance side is still missing and further impact parameters like flow velocity remain unconsidered. On the basis of the August 2002 Saxony flood data base, a method to determine the structural damage for any given flood scenario was developed. This method is improved to consider the correlation between inundation level and flow velocity and structural damage. The study is based on two different dataseis collected after the flood 2002 in Saxony: - Dataset 1 is related to the outcome of a questionnaire survey performed by the authors between 2002 and 2004. - Dataset 2 is the outcome of an evaluation of damage expertises by order of the "" Landestalsperrenverwaltung Sachsen"". A set of new Specific Vulnerability Functions (SVF) for calculation of damage grades is derived considering the inundation level and the flow velocity depending on the vulnerability of the predominant building types. Based on new developed Specific Damage Functions (SDF) the calculated damage grades are transferred into loss estimates. The developed tools are applied to the reinterpretation of the August 2002 flood damage. Results of the approach are presented for three different study areas in the free state of Saxony. In all cases a remarkable good agreement between the predicted and the reported loss can be stated.

18094,"Fragility-based assessment of public buildings in Turkey Public buildings which are mostly built of reinforced concrete with template designs constitute a great part of the vulnerable public building stock in Turkey as well as in several other countries prone to earthquakes. This study focuses on seismic fragility assessment of reinforced concrete public buildings with representative template designs, which have been designed according to the 1975 version of the Turkish seismic design code. Lateral stiffness, strength and displacement capacities of the selected template designs are determined by nonlinear static analyses in two principal directions. The inelastic dynamic characteristics of the template designs investigated are represented by equivalent single degree of freedom systems and their seismic deformation demands are calculated using a set of 100 strong ground motion records. Peak ground velocity is selected as the measure of seismic intensity because it has a good correlation with maximum inelastic displacements. Based on assessed capacities and demands, fragility curves are derived separately for each template designs. Buildings are grouped according to the number of storeys. The results revealed that the effect of concrete and detailing quality on IO performance level is more limited and less critical as the ground motion intensity increases. On the other hand, the probability of exceedence for LS and CP are closer to each other for each group of buildings. Finally, using constructed fragility curves, collapse probabilities of existing public buildings were estimated according to PGV values. The results are evaluated in terms of concrete quality and transverse reinforcement detailing. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

15000,"- Seismic damage evaluation of a 38-storey building model using measured FrF data reduced via principal component analysis Publisher Summary This chapter investigates the seismic damage of a 38-storey tall building model using measured frequency response function (FRF) data and neural network technique. The 1:20 scale structural model was tested on a shaking table by exerting successively enhanced ground earthquake excitations to generate trifling, moderate, severe, and complete (nearly collapsed) damage, respectively. A total of 27 accelerometers were instrumented on the structure for the measurement of FRFs in healthy state and after incurring each of the damage scenarios. A multilayer neural network with FRF data as input variables was configured and trained for damage occurrence, and extent detection in the structure. In order to circumvent the difficulty of huge dimension of input vector when using full-size FRF data with neural network, principal component analysis (PCA) was introduced to compress the size of FRFs, and the projection of measured FRFs onto the most significant principal components was finally used instead of raw FRF data as neural network input for damage identification. The results showed that this approach could indicate the structural damage condition with high fidelity.

19881,"Quantitative assessment of physical fragility of buildings to the debris flow on 20 August 2019 in the Cutou gully, Wenchuan, southwestern China Catastrophic debris flows are frequently triggered by rainstorms after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake and pose great threats to residential buildings and human lives in the mountainous areas. However, little effort has been devoted to studying the quantitative assessment of the physical vulnerability of buildings to debris flows in the Wenchuan earthquake-affected areas. To cope with this deficiency, this paper presented a quantitative method to assess the physical fragility of buildings related to debris flows by analyzing the debris flow activity and building damage features. First, we constructed a building database in the area affected by the Cutou debris flow and determined the degree of damage to each building. Then, the momentum flux was selected as a debris flow intensity parameter, considering the combined effect of flow velocity and flow depth. We used the FLO-2D software to reproduce the process of the debris flow that occurred on 20 August 2019 in the Cutou gully and obtained the intensity parameters of the debris flow. Finally, we proposed physical fragility curves for different types of building structures to the debris flow based on the model describing the probability of exceeding different damage states corresponding to different intensities of debris flows. In the case of brick-concrete buildings, when the momentum flux was 8 m3/s2, buildings were moderately damaged at the probability P = 1 with a 95% confidence interval, and complete damage was sustained from a momentum flux of 36 m3/s2. Masonry-wood buildings sustained complete damage from a momentum flux of 5 m3/s2. The structural resistance of buildings to debris flows in the Wenchuan earthquake-affected region can be assessed by using the proposed physical fragility functions, which provide a scientific basis for risk management and mitigation strategies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

20020,"Regional based exposure models to account for local building typologies The development of building inventory is a fundamental step for the evaluation of the seismic risk at territorial scale. Census data are usually employed for building inventory in large scale application and their use requires suitable rules to assign buildings typologies to vulnerability classes, that is an exposure model specific for the considered vulnerability model. Several exposure models are developed proposing class assignment rules that are calibrated on building typological data available from post-earthquake survey data. However, this approach has the drawback of being based on data from specific geographic areas that have been hit by damaging earthquakes. Indeed, the distribution of building typologies can vary greatly for different areas of a country and the diffusion of one building's typology rather than another one may depend on the availability of construction material in the area, the evolution of construction techniques and the codes in force at the time of construction. This paper aims to improve the exposure modelling at regional scale, investigating the variability of masonry building typologies distribution. It proposes a methodology to recalibrate the exposure models at regional scale and evaluates the influence of the improved characterization of regional vulnerability on damage and risk assessment. The study shows that the analysis of local building typologies may strongly impact on the evaluation of the seismic risk at territorial scale.

12882,"Engineering-Based Tornado Damage Assessment: Numerical Tool for Assessing Tornado Vulnerability of Residential Structures Following a series of deadly tornadoes between 2011 and 2013, this paper develops a numerical tool to help communities better predict and quantify the potential tornado damage to single-family residential structures from a tornado strike. The objective is to determine the predictive capability of an engineering-based tornado damage-assessment (ETDA) Tool using published building damage observations captured by the authors in a recent tornado. The research is motivated by the need for the public to visualize the extent of tornado vulnerabilities of residential buildings in our communities. The research developed a numerical estimation model to aggregate damage that a specified tornado would cause to the residential wood-framed structures in a community. The ETDA Tool was developed around a Monte Carlo simulation engine, using theoretical models for tornado wind velocity and pressure drop in the tornado vortex, as well as experimentally-determined probability distribution functions for the structural resistances of eight building component systems selected to describe the structure. The output of the EDTA Tool is presented as series of mean damage ratios, and other statistics quantifying tornado-damage caused, plotted against distance away from the tornado vortex centerline. The paper explains the methodology of the approach and presents results comparing hindcast damage ratios against observed values of field-observations collected after a tornado strike on residential communities in Garland/Rowlett, TX. It was found the ETDA Tool provides reasonable agreement with the field damage observations to houses. The Tool could be used by a community to model any tornado path and/or size and estimate future damage. More research to further our understanding of tornado-induced wind loads and wind-borne debris effects is needed to increase confidence in its application to any tornado and any city. © Copyright © 2020 Jain, Bhusar, Roueche and Prevatt. damage  Monte - Carlo simulation  residential  structural load paths  tornado  wind engineering  wind load None",Engineering-Based Tornado Damage Assessment: Numerical Tool for Assessing Tornado Vulnerability of Residential Structures,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,Analytical
17068,"Earthquake damage assessment based on fuzzy loǵic and neural networks Potential damage assessment is fundamental for defining mitigation procedures and risk management strategies. Damage assessment involves the difficulties of defining, assessing, and modeling the variables involved, as well as handling uncertainty. Seismic damage estimation of structures does not only depend on the behavior of the structural system, but it involves other factors, which differ in nature. The paper presents a methodology for damage assessment of structures that combines systems theory, fuzzy logic, and neural networks.

The network has been trained using the damage observed in the recent earthquake that occurred in central Colombia. Several sets of structures were evaluated and the results compared to the damage observed. The model showed to be highly reliable and a good representation of experts' opinions.

17733,"Façade damage assessment of concrete buildings in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake The magnitude 6.3 earthquake that struck Christchurch on 22 February 2011 caused widespread damage throughout Christchurch's central business district (CBD), where a large proportion of the building stock consists of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings. Damage to the façades of these buildings was a clear contributor to overall building damage. This paper presents the damage assessment of the façade systems of these RC buildings. A survey of 173 RC buildings in the Christchurch CBD is conducted here, focusing on the damage to the façade systems of the buildings. The survey covers only buildings greater than three storeys in height, excluding the majority of unreinforced masonry façades, the damage to which has been well documented. The façade type and modularity is classified for each system, as well as the connection type where possible. The level of damage to each façade is determined in terms of the following performance levels: Operational, Immediate Occupancy, Life Safety and High Hazard. Further investigation is also made into three precast concrete panel systems. These case studies examine the damage, detailing and construction practice of each particular system.

19064,"Multivariate pluvial flood damage models Depth-damage-functions, relating the monetary flood damage to the depth of the inundation, are commonly used in the case of fluvial floods (floods caused by a river overflowing). We construct four multivariate damage models for pluvial floods (caused by extreme rainfall) by differentiating on the one hand between ground floor floods and basement floods and on the other hand between damage to residential buildings and damage to housing contents. We do not only take into account the effect of flood-depth on damage, but also incorporate the effects of non-hazard indicators (building characteristics, behavioural indicators and socio-economic variables). By using a Tobit-estimation technique on identified victims of pluvial floods in Flanders (Belgium), we take into account the effect of cases of reported zero damage. Our results show that the flood depth is an important predictor of damage, but with a diverging impact between ground floor floods and basement floods. Also non-hazard indicators are important. For example being aware of the risk just before the water enters the building reduces content damage considerably, underlining the importance of warning systems and policy in this case of pluvial floods. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In the generation of the FCs, damage states according to the EMS98 scale have been considered while the intensity measure has been defined by adopting an integral parameter, such as the Housner intensity. FCs have been generated by varying different parameters, including building age, number of storeys, presence and position of infill panels, plan dimensions, external beams stiffness and concrete strength. In order to verify the effectiveness of the damage prediction, comparisons were made between the results obtained from the proposed FCs with those deriving from both prominent fragility studies available in the technical literature and damage distributions observed in past earthquakes. Results show that damage grades obtained by adopting the proposed FCs are generally lower than those provided by the other approaches considered. A comparison with real damage data, shows that the proposed FCs generally estimate more severe damage distributions than those observed in past earthquakes, although they give lower differences with respect to the other approaches. © 2015 Techno-Press, Ltd.

21476,"Statistical modelling of seismic vulnerability of RC, timber and masonry buildings from complete empirical loss data In June 2000 two shallow, strike slip, Mw6.5 earthquakes occurred in the middle of the largest agricultural region in Iceland. The epicentres were close to small towns and villages and almost 5000 residential buildings were affected. A great deal of damage occurred but no residential buildings collapsed and there was no loss of life. Insurance against natural disasters is compulsory for all buildings in Iceland and they are all registered in a comprehensive official property database. Therefore, to fulfil insurance claims, a field survey was carried out after the two earthquakes where repair cost was estimated for every damaged building. By combing the loss data with the property database it was possible to establish a complete loss database, where all residential buildings in the affected area were included, both buildings with loss as well as buildings with no-loss. The main aim of the study was to fit a statistical vulnerability model to the data. Due to the high proportion of no-loss buildings in the database ( 84%) a new and novel vulnerability model was used based on a zero-inflated beta regression model. The model was fitted to the three main building typologies in the affected region, i.e. low-rise structural wall RC, timber, and masonry buildings. The proposed model can be used to predict the mean and desired prediction limits of the losses for a given intensity level as well as to create fragility functions. All the typologies showed outstanding performance in the two destructive earthquakes, which is important to report, model and learn from.

18473,"Influence of Geometric Variation on Seismic Fragility Assessment All planners are motivated to form structures in the best possible way to limit quakes in this time when sustainability is critical. Damages to the buildings during recent earthquakes in India lead to the need for seismic risk assessment, capable of predicting the probability of damage to the building. During analysis, seismic loads being implied is crucial to evaluate the provisional probability of structural response of the buildings considering realistic aspect by the generation of fragility curves to predict vulnerability index. Before an earthquake, fragility curves can be plotted to estimate losses, and after an earthquake, they can be used to assess seismic losses. Depending on the source of data and type of analysis, fragility curves may be derived using empirical or analytical methods and can be plotted to display the likelihood of any harm state being surpassed. For short-period, medium-period, and long-period structures, the work described here is compiled for building frame structures with deviations for 3, 6 and 12 storeys, respectively, each having variation in planar shape as a square shape, L-shape and T-shapes based on nonlinear static analysis, using SAP2000 as a software tool for analysing the structure and guidelines as per HAZUS technical manual for plotting fragility curves.

16923,"Development of parametric seismic fragility curves for historical churches For both spiritual and cultural reasons, churches are an essential part of the historical heritage of several countries worldwide, including Europe, Americas and Australasia. The extreme damage that occurred during the 2016–2017 Central Italy seismic swarm highlighted once again the noteworthy seismic vulnerability of unreinforced masonry churches, which exhibited several collapses and caused uncountable losses to the Italian artistic heritage. The seismic performance of 158 affected buildings was analyzed in the aftermath of the main shocks. The failure modes activated by the earthquakes were identified making reference to the local mechanisms currently considered in Italy for post-seismic assessment of churches. The structural damage of the investigated buildings, related to 21 mechanisms rather than to an overall global response, was explained resorting to empirical statistical procedures taking into account ground motion intensity and structural details that can worsen or improve the seismic performance. Finally, parametric fragility curves were derived selecting those structural details that mostly influence the damage by means of the likelihood-ratio test. Developed models can be used in future territorial-scale scenario or risk analyses. © 2021, The Author(s). 2016–2017 Central Italy earthquakes  Damage levels  Maximum likelihood estimation  Peak ground acceleration  Statistical regressions  Vulnerability assessment Religious buildings  Risk analysis  Risk perception  Seismic waves  Structural analysis  Ground motion intensities  Historical heritages  Likelihood ratio tests  Seismic fragility curves  Seismic Performance  Seismic vulnerability  Structural details  Unreinforced masonry  Earthquakes  ground motion  masonry  parameterization  seismic data  vulnerability  Australasia",Development of parametric seismic fragility curves for historical churches,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14370635342978183,0.2411957941864774,0.016717518021905593,0.012021600292336702,Empirical
21969,"Towards the updated Italian seismic risk assessment: exposure and vulnerability modelling Within the 2019–2021 research agreement between the Civil Protection Department (DPC) and the Network of University Laboratories for Earthquake Engineering (ReLUIS), the work package WP4 “Seismic Risk Maps—MARS” is specifically devoted to update the 2018 release of the Italian National Seismic Risk Assessment. To this end, the previously considered models of hazard, exposure and vulnerability will be critically reviewed and updated by taking advantage also from the results deriving from other WPs of the DPC-ReLUIS research project. In the present paper some of the most relevant aspects that are being introduced in the development of the new Italian risk maps have been described and shortly analysed. First, a significant upgrade of the vulnerability model implemented in the new version of the platform used for risk calculation (IRMA) is proposed, where reference to the six EMS-98 classes is made also considering regional vulnerability features. Further, empirical data from observed real damage are integrated with results from numerical simulations (mechanical approach), in particular for reinforced concrete buildings. Finally, some special construction types such as schools, churches and bridges are included in order to provide a more comprehensive view of the national risk. © 2021, The Author(s).

15352,"A simplified non-linear modelling strategy to generate fragility curves for old masonry buildings In the context of historical seismology, studying the behaviour of historic masonry buildings is of great importance, as they are witnesses of past events. While interesting methods can be found in the literature to assess the seismic vulnerability of masonry structures subject to strong earthquakes, the topic of moderate seismicity, as encountered in many European countries, is still to be investigated. The present work proposes a global methodology to build fragility curves for existing masonry buildings. An efficient computational method to address the non-linear response of masonry structures is presented. The method is based on the modal decomposition of the structural response. An equivalent non-linear single degree of freedom oscillator is identified for the main modes. The modelling strategy enables to carry out numerous computations with a low computational effort, allowing for a probabilistic approach. To build fragility curves, a damage indicator based on the frequency shift is chosen. To validate the proposed approach, the simplified model of a real masonry building is compared to a full non-linear time history analysis. The method is eventually illustrated by the derivation of fragility curves for industrial masonry buildings. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd Damage  Fragility functions  Historical seismology  Masonry Buildings  Degrees of freedom (mechanics)  Earthquakes  Masonry construction  Computational effort  Modelling strategies  Non-linear modelling  Old masonry buildings  Probabilistic approaches  Seismic vulnerability  Single-degree-of-freedom oscillators  Structural response  Masonry materials",A simplified non-linear modelling strategy to generate fragility curves for old masonry buildings,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5755481205708551,0.05554735392897099,0.004339230716696402,0.04722293403215921,Analytical
20543,"Seismic fragility analysis of composite frame structure based on performance Steel-concrete composite structures that share the advantages of both steel structure and concrete structure have been developed rapidly and used widely. It has been a popular structure in high-rise buildings in recent years. Although more and more composite structures have been used in earthquake area, only a few literatures about fragility analysis of this type of structure are available. In this paper, a fragility analysis method based on performance is proposed, in which both the uncertainty due to variability in structures and ground motion are considered. Seismic fragility analysis is performed for a 15-story composite beam-concrete-filled square steel tube column frame by the proposed method. The top-drift-angle and the story-drift-angle are used as quantitative indexes to define the four different performance levels. Then seismic demand probability analysis is carried out and fragility curves are derived to assess the seismic performance of this type of structure. © 2010 The Seismological Society of China and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

17455,"Estimation uncertainty of direct monetary flood damage to buildings Traditional flood design methods are increasingly supplemented or replaced by risk-oriented methods which are based on comprehensive risk analyses. Besides meteorological, hydrological and hydraulic investigations such analyses require the estimation of flood impacts. Flood impact assessments mainly focus on direct economic losses using damage functions which relate property damage to damage-causing factors. Although the flood damage of a building is influenced by many factors, usually only inundation depth and building use are considered as damage-causing factors. In this paper a data set of approximately 4000 damage records is analysed. Each record represents the direct monetary damage to an inundated building. The data set covers nine flood events in Germany from 1978 to 1994. It is shown that the damage data follow a Lognormal distribution with a large variability, even when stratified according to the building use and to water depth categories. Absolute depth-damage functions which relate the total damage to the water depth are not very helpful in explaining the variability of the damage data, because damage is determined by various parameters besides the water depth. Because of this limitation it has to be expected that flood damage assessments are associated with large uncertainties. It is shown that the uncertainty of damage estimates depends on the number of flooded buildings and on the distribution of building use within the flooded area. The results are exemplified by a damage assessment for a rural area in southwest Germany, for which damage estimates and uncertainty bounds are quantified for a 100-year flood event. The estimates are compared to reported flood damages of a severe flood in 1993. Given the enormous uncertainty of flood damage estimates the refinement of flood damage data collection and modelling are major issues for further empirical and methodological improvements.

16696,"Damage to residential buildings due to flooding of New Orleans after hurricane Katrina This article analyzes the direct damage to residential buildings caused by the flooding of New Orleans after hurricane Katrina in the year 2005. A public dataset has been analyzed that contains information on the economic damage levels for approximately 95,000 residential buildings in the flooded area. The relationship between the flood characteristics and economic damage to residential buildings has been investigated. Results of hydrodynamic flood simulations have been used that give insight in water depths and flow velocities in the study area. In general, differences between the three polders in the observed distributions of damage estimates are related to differences in flood conditions. The highest damage percentages and structural damage mainly occurred in areas where higher flow velocities occurred, especially near the breaches in the Lower 9th Ward neighborhood. Further statistical analysis indicated that there is not any strong one-to-one relationship between the damage percentage and the water depth or the depth-velocity product. This suggests that there is considerable uncertainty associated with stage-damage functions, especially when they are applied to individual structures or smaller clusters of buildings. Based on the data, a more general approach has been proposed that could be used to distinguish different damage zones based on water depth and flow velocity for an area that is affected by flooding due to breaching of flood defenses. Further validation of existing damage models with the dataset and further inclusion of information on building type in the analysis of damage levels is recommended. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

20700,"SEISMIC FRAGILITY FUNCTION FOR SINGLE STOREY MASONRY WALL RC BUILDING IN PADANG CITY, INDONESIA Historical earthquakes in Indonesia show that low storey Reinforced Concrete with masonry wall buildings is vulnerable under seismic load. However, an adequate fragility function is suggested as a potential seismic assessment tool for RC buildings based on the actual condition of the existing structures. Therefore, this study aims to develop the fragility function for a typical low-storey RC building with a masonry wall in Padang City, Indonesia, based on the actual condition of the existing structures. The development of the fragility function used an analytical technique by incorporating the Applied Element Method (AEM) and Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA). AEM enables high accuracy of damage observation to the no-damage structures till the collapse stage. The damage stages at every PGA increment were compiled to obtain the cumulative probability. The log-normal distribution was used to derive the fragility function and create a curve. The developed fragility curve showed that at 0.3g PGA, the damage ratio of buildings sustained by slight, moderate, heavy dilapidation were 0.24, 0.54, and 0.92, respectively. The obtained fragility function to the damage ratio was validated based on the actual damage record from the 2009 West Sumatra Earthquake (2009 WSE). The comparison showed that the damage ratio obtained from the developed fragility function is close to the actual dilapidation from the 2009 West Sumatra Earthquake. Hence, the developed fragility function is potentially used as an assessment tool to predict the damage due to the Mega-Earthquake incident © Int.

21388,"Simulation based improved seismic fragility analysis of structures The Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) based seismic fragility analysis (SFA) approach allows defining more realistic relationship between failure probability and seismic intensity. However, the approach requires simulating large number of nonlinear dynamic analyses of structure for reliable estimate of fragility. It makes the approach computationally challenging. The response surface method (RSM) based metamodeling approach which replaces computationally involve complex mechanical model of a structure is found to be a viable alternative in this regard. An adaptive moving least squares method (MLSM) based RSM in the MCS framework is explored in the present study for efficient SFA of existing structures. In doing so, the repetition of seismic intensity for complete generation of fragility curve is avoided by including this as one of the predictors in the response estimate model. The proposed procedure is elucidated by considering a non-linear SDOF system and an existing reinforced concrete frame considered to be located in the Guwahati City of the Northeast region of India. The fragility results are obtained by the usual least squares based and the proposed MLSM based RSM and compared with that of obtained by the direct MCS technique to study the effectiveness of the proposed approach. seismic fragility analysis  Monte Carlo simulation  response surface method  adaptive moving least squares method RESPONSE-SURFACE APPROXIMATIONS  GROUND-MOTION  NORTHEASTERN INDIA  EARTHQUAKES  RELIABILITY  CONCRETE  STRESS  CURVES  MODELS  UNCERTAINTY",Simulation based improved seismic fragility analysis of structures,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12127372668849698,0.013687109820824337,0.031952092751238094,0.10317619258524242,Analytical
18036,"Fragility curves for risk-targeted seismic design maps Seismic design using maps based on ""risk-targeting"" would lead to an annual probability of attaining or exceeding a certain damage state that is uniform over an entire territory. These maps are based on convolving seismic hazard curves from a standard probabilistic analysis with the derivative of fragility curves expressing the chance for a code-designed structure to attain or exceed a certain damage state given a level of input motion, e.g. peak ground acceleration (PGA). There are few published fragility curves for structures respecting the Eurocodes (ECs, principally EC8 for seismic design) that can be used for the development of risk-targeted design maps for Europe. In this article a set of fragility curves for a regular three-storey reinforced-concrete building designed using EC2 and EC8 for medium ductility and increasing levels of design acceleration (ag) is developed. These curves show that structures designed using EC8 against PGAs up to about 1 m/s2 have similar fragilities to those that respect only EC2 (although this conclusion may not hold for irregular buildings, other geometries or materials). From these curves, the probability of yielding for a structure subjected to a PGA equal to ag varies between 0.14 (ag =0.7m/s2) and 0.85 (ag=3m/s2 whereas the probability of collapse for a structure subjected to a PGA equal to ag varies between 1.7×10-7(ag=0.7 m/s2) and 1.0 × 10-5 (ag=3m/s2). © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

16248,"Comparative fragility methods for seismic assessment of masonry buildings located in Muccia (Italy) The current paper focuses on a sector of the historic centre of Muccia, in the district of Macerata (Italy), affected by the seismic sequence that involved Central Italy in 2016. The main goal is comparison, in terms of fragility curves, among two vulnerability assessment methodologies (empirical and mechanical). The study area has been structurally and typologically identified according to the Building Typology Matrix (BTM). Physical vulnerability analysis of the urban-sector was performed through application of an index-based method, specifically for masonry building aggregates. An isolated masonry building, damaged after the seismic sequences, has been selected as a case study. For the assessed building, empirical fragility curves are presented according to Guagenti & Petrini's correlation law. Furthermore, a numerical model has been set up by using the macro-element approach, which has allowed to perform non-linear static analyses. Mechanical properties of masonry were defined according to the New Technical Codes for Constructions (NTC18), assuming a limited knowledge level (LC1). Refined mechanical fragility functions have been derived and compared to the empirical ones. Analysis results have shown that the empirical method tends to overestimate by 5% and 10% the expected damage for slight and moderate thresholds. For PGA values greater than 0,3 g the damage levels decreased by 30% and 20%, with reference to the near collapse and collapse conditions, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd Damage scenarios  Empirical method  Fragility curves  Masonry buildings  Mechanical method  Vulnerability assessment Buildings  Masonry construction  Masonry materials  Seismology  Static analysis  Damage scenarios  Empirical method  Fragility curves  Masonry building  Mechanical methods  Vulnerability assessments  Damage detection",Comparative fragility methods for seismic assessment of masonry buildings located in Muccia (Italy),0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06825573534681541,0.17959665947533543,0.030030610912840344,0.008746391563651111,Empirical

15653,"Application of fragility curves to estimate building damage and economic loss at a community scale: a case study of Seaside, Oregon Community-scale estimates of building damage and economic loss are modeled for Seaside, Oregon, for Cascadia subduction zone events ranging from 8.7 to 9.3 M-W with corresponding slip distances of 3-25 m considering only the effects of the tsunami. Numerical simulations are obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's method of splitting tsunami model which includes a source model, subsidence, and calculations of the propagation and inundation flow characteristics. The damage estimates are based on fragility curves from the literature which relate flow depth with probability of damage for two different structural materials of buildings. Calculations are performed at the parcel level for the inundation hazard without including damage caused by the earthquake itself. Calculations show that the severity of building damage in Seaside is sensitive to the magnitude of the event or degree of slip because the majority of the city is located on low-lying coastal land within the estimated inundation zone. For the events modeled, the percentage of building within the inundation zone ranges from 9 to 88 %, with average direct economic losses ranging from $2 million to $1.2 billion.

20885,"Seismic performance of reinforced concrete frame buildings in Bhutan based on fuzzy probability analysis Seismic performance of reinforced concrete (RC) frame buildings is mostly assessed based on the distinct interstorey drift limits defined by many existing guidelines. In reality, damage of a structure is a continuous process under the action of the load and also depends on a number of factors. Therefore damage can be more logically defined with a fuzzy performance level than a distinct interstorey drift limit. In this paper, probability and fuzzy set theory are used to estimate the realistic failure probabilities of the RC buildings in Bhutan by considering randomness in material and geometrical parameters and fuzziness in the damage criteria. Three typical RC frame buildings in Thimphu, Bhutan and the ground motions predicted at the generic soil sites in Thimphu are used for the structural response prediction. Rosenbluth Point Estimate Method is used for modelling the statistical variation of the input parameters and the computer program Perform 3D is used for carrying out the dynamic nonlinear analysis of the buildings. Monte Carlo Simulation is employed to validate the accuracy of the Rosenbluth Point Estimate Method and determine the statistical distribution of the response quantities. Soil structure interaction (SSI) is considered at the soft soil site using the uncoupled spring model. Based on the mean and standard deviation of the intersotrey drifts obtained from the analyses, the fuzzy failure probabilities of the buildings are estimated. It is found that under the 475 year return period ground motions, typical buildings experience a high probability of irreparable and severe damages, while the high probability of severe damage and complete collapse are predicted under the 2475 year return period ground motions. SSI is found to be detrimental to the 3 storey building, while no significant effect is observed to the 6 storey building.

21720,"Testing empirical and synthetic flood damage models: the case of Italy Flood risk management generally relies on economic assessments performed by using flood loss models of different complexity, ranging from simple univariable models to more complex multivariable models. The latter account for a large number of hazard, exposure and vulnerability factors, being potentially more robust when extensive input information is available. We collected a comprehensive data set related to three recent major flood events in northern Italy (Adda 2002, Bacchiglione 2010 and Secchia 2014), including flood hazard features (depth, velocity and duration), building characteristics (size, type, quality, economic value) and reported losses. The objective of this study is to compare the performances of expert-based and empirical (both uni-and multivariable) damage models for estimating the potential economic costs of flood events to residential buildings. The performances of four literature flood damage models of different natures and complexities are compared with those of univariable, bivariable and multivariable models trained and tested by using empirical records from Italy. The uni- and bivariable models are developed by using linear, logarithmic and square root regression, whereas multivariable models are based on two machine-learning techniques: random forest and artificial neural networks. Results provide important insights about the choice of the damage modelling approach for operational disaster risk management. Our findings suggest that multivariable models have better potential for producing reliable damage estimates when extensive ancillary data for flood event characterisation are available, while univariable models can be adequate if data are scarce. The analysis also highlights that expert-based synthetic models are likely better suited for transferability to other areas compared to empirically based flood damage models.

An empirical approach was chosen to assess the seismic vulnerability of the existing buildings, using the Vulnerability Index Method (RISK-UE), and considering two earthquake scenarios (deterministic and probabilistic). Special concern was given to the seismic vulnerability in Imzouren since the 2004 earthquake (24 February, mw = 6.4) that struck the region and caused substantial damage. A site investigation was conducted in the city targeting more than 3000 residential buildings, which had been closely examined and catalogued to assess their seismic vulnerability. The results of the seismic risk assessment in the city are represented through damage to the buildings, harm to the population and economic loss.

21025,"Seismic Risk Assessment of Nonengineered Residential Buildings in Developing Countries A previous study by the authors provides an overview of existing seismic risk assessment approaches and available seismic fragility information and highlights the lack of relevant information for nonengineered residential buildings. The current paper proposes a procedure for developing empirical seismic fragility curves for nonengineered residential buildings using the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) seismic ground motion and shaking intensity maps presented in a geographic information system (GIS) format, to overcome the lack of ground motion recordings. The proposed procedure has been applied to a damage data set collected in Bantul Regency, Indonesia, in the aftermath of the May 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake. Fragility curves for nonengineered single-story unreinforced masonry (URM) residential buildings have been derived using the damage data set for the peak ground acceleration (PGA) and pseudospectral acceleration (PSA) as the ground motion intensity measures. The developed fragility curves indicate the high seismic vulnerability of nonengineered residential buildings. This study also demonstrates the potential of utilizing USGS seismic ground motion data to develop empirical fragility curves for nonengineered residential buildings in developing countries.

19729,"Probabilistic evaluation of seismic resilience for typical vital buildings in terms of vulnerability curves Since the societies are continuously exposed to a range of natural disasters such as earthquakes, several precautions must be taken before and after an earthquake to reduce the damages. In this regard, seismic resilience evaluation is considered to be one of the practical actions. Resilience, as a function, indicates the capacity to maintain the level of efficiency or functionality about a given particular building, bridge, or vital network of a community during a defined period which could be determined by the community or the experts in this field. In this paper, a typical hospital was selected as a representative of a vital building. Following that, for incremental dynamic analysis, 22 records were selected based on the distance from the fault. In the next stage, a coefficients-based method was applied to obtain the fragility curves. Furthermore, the vulnerability curves were directly derived from the fragility curves which are the basis for calculating the loss function and seismic resilience index. The results indicate that vulnerability curves could be considered as powerful tools for evaluating the seismic resilience of vital building with an acceptable degree of precision. © 2019 Institution of Structural Engineers Functionality  Resilience  Seismic evaluation  Vital building  Vulnerability curves None",Probabilistic evaluation of seismic resilience for typical vital buildings in terms of vulnerability curves,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21116720821561716,0.02754785425886945,0.02334373831040775,0.006137345725717,Analytical
18879,"Minimal building flood fragility and loss function portfolio for resilience analysis at the community level Current flood vulnerability analyses rely on deterministic methods (e.g., stage-damage functions) to quantify resulting damage and losses to the built environment. While such approaches have been used extensively by communities, they do not enable the propagation of uncertainty into a risk-or resilience-informed decision process. In this paper, a method that allows the development of building fragility and building loss functions is articulated and applied to develop an archetype portfolio that can be used to model buildings in a typical community. The typical single-variable flood vulnerability function, normally based on flood depth, is extended to a multi-variate flood vulnerability function, which is a function of both flood depth and flood duration, thereby creating fragility surfaces. The portfolio presented herein consists of 15 building archetypes that can serve to populate a community-level model to predict damage and resulting functionality from a scenario flood event. The prediction of damage and functionality of buildings within a community is the first step in developing risk-informed mitigation decisions to improve community resilience. © 2020 by the authors.

16088,"Case Study: Scenario based seismic loss estimation for concrete buildings in mid America This paper focuses on probabilistic loss estimation of concrete buildings subject to seismic activity in the Central United States. The scenario earthquakes under consideration have three moment magnitudes, and Shelby County, Tennessee, is selected as the case study region. The buildings considered are typical reinforced concrete frame buildings and tilt-up concrete buildings in this region. Fragility curves based on recently developed demand models are used to represent the seismic vulnerability of the buildings. The structural damage of the selected buildings is assessed with a probabilistic approach that uses empirical structural damage factors and accounts for the prevailing uncertainties. Finally, corresponding losses for the buildings are estimated using a probabilistic framework. Through this approach, critical structures that might be expected to have extensive damage are identified. Additionally, the result of the scenario-based approach provides decision makers with information needed to prioritize mitigation options for high risk structures due to potential earthquakes. © 2014, Earthquake Engineering Research Institute.

15220,"A new analytical procedure for the derivation of displacement-based vulnerability curves for populations of RC structures A new procedure is proposed for the derivation of analytical displacement-based vulnerability curves for the seismic assessment of populations of reinforced concrete structures. The methodology represents an optimum solution compromising between reliability and computational efficiency. Adaptive pushover analysis is employed within a capacity spectrum framework of assessment, to determine the performance of a population of building models for increasing ground motion intensity. The building model population is generated from a single design through consideration of material parameter uncertainty, with design of experiment techniques used to optimise the population size. Uncertainty in ground motion is accounted for through the use of suites of accelerograms with characteristics that are representative of the hazard level associated with the performance level assessed in each vulnerability curve. The new homogeneous reinforced concrete damage scale, which is experimentally calibrated to maximum inter-storey drift for different structural systems, is used to determine the damage state of the building at the performance point. The results of the assessments are used to construct response surfaces from which the damage statistics forming the basis of the vulnerability curves are generated through re-sampling. The proposed methodology is illustrated for the case of low-rise, infilled RC frames with inadequate seismic provisions. The derived curves show good correlation with observational post-earthquake damage statistics.

18495,"Influence of Real Ground Motion Records in Performance Assessment of RC Buildings Reinforced concrete frame buildings with Open Ground Story (OGS) are one of the most common building configurations in urban habitat. These configurations are known to be vulnerable to seismic excitations, primarily due to the sudden loss in strength in the ground story and differential stiffness distribution throughout the structure. The differential stiffness distribution is attributed primarily to the interaction of non-structural infill wall with the moment-resisting frame. Hence, the interaction of infill wall needs to be accounted in estimating the seismic vulnerability. Therefore, the present investigation is focused on understanding the impact of utilizing real ground motion records on the performance assessment of RC buildings with and without consideration of infill walls. Fragility curves were developed for low and mid-rise structural models using Capacity Spectrum Method (CSM) specified by ATC-40 and with Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA). CSM uses the response spectrum specified by the respective code, unlike IDA where an ensemble of spectrum compatible real ground motion accelerograms satisfying the necessary site conditions is used in assessing the performance. Further, significant variations observed in the developed fragility curves by CSM and IDA emphasizes the sensitivity of real ground motion data in performance assessment.

22033,"Typological characterisation of vintage unreinforced masonry buildings of Queensland, Australia Characterisation of buildings is critical for the rapid assessment and seismic loss estimation of buildings after an earthquake event. This paper presents a literature review on the characterisation of unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings followed by a typological study of the building stock in Queensland, Australia. The literature review showed that characterisation studies are aimed at cataloguing and developing inventories of buildings for the purpose of seismic vulnerability and risk assessment, and behaviour-influencing parameters are often used as a basis for building classification. Guided by the literature review, a field study was conducted to document important features of vintage (pre-1940) URM buildings that can influence their behaviour during an earthquake. The surveyed aspects included the construction year, number of storeys, roof type, irregularities in plan, isolated or inter-connected buildings, overall dimensions of the buildings, size and shape of windows, facade opening ratio, presence of chimneys, and the style of parapets. Importantly, it was found that certain parapet typologies are prevalent, but that their seismic behaviour is currently unknown. A few such typologies were recommended for future seismic assessment studies. This study can serve as a basis for conducting seismic assessment risk and vulnerability studies in the future.

17882,"Forecasting time-variable earthquake risk for reinforced concrete buildings during aftershock sequences based on operational earthquake forecasting and resonance period elongation The probability of a reinforced concrete building to sustain cumulative damage during afterschock sequences is a key issue for crisis management. Assessments of time-variant probabilities of damage states are made herein for reinforced concrete building models the city of Thessaloniki, Greece, in the case of a mainshock scenario. The elongation of the first eigenperiod of the building is used as the engineering demand parameter in the computation of the fragility curves for the building models. Period elongation is selected, as it is readily available in the case of buildings with permanent monitoring systems, which are part of a critical infrastructure, and it may be used complementary to post-earthquake building inspection in order to assess earthquake damage. The increase of the vulnerability of the buildings with time due to potential earthquake damage accumulation is modeled with a probabilistic approach, which is based on the Markov chain. During the aftershock sequences the probability to exceed period elongation thresholds accumulates. Additional risk due to aftershocks as a function of time is estimated and the developed framework is based on the traffic-light concept (red-orange-green) for building-tagging with respect to seismic risk to support earthquake risk management in the course of aftershock sequences. © 2019 The authors.

21043,"Seismic Risk of Infrastructure Systems with Treatment of and Sensitivity to Epistemic Uncertainty Modern society's very existence is tied to the proper and reliable functioning of its Critical Infrastructure (CI) systems. In the seismic risk assessment of an infrastructure, taking into account all the relevant uncertainties affecting the problem is crucial. While both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties affect the estimate of seismic risk to an infrastructure and should be considered, the focus herein is on the latter. After providing an up-to-date literature review about the treatment of and sensitivity to epistemic uncertainty, this paper presents a comprehensive framework for seismic risk assessment of interdependent spatially distributed infrastructure systems that accounts for both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties and provides confidence in the estimate, as well as sensitivity of uncertainty in the output to the components of epistemic uncertainty in the input. The logic tree approach is used for the treatment of epistemic uncertainty and for the sensitivity analysis, whose results are presented through tornado diagrams. Sensitivity is also evaluated by elaborating the logic tree results through weighted ANOVA. The formulation is general and can be applied to risk assessment problems involving not only infrastructural but also structural systems. The presented methodology was implemented into an open-source software, OOFIMS, and applied to a synthetic city composed of buildings and a gas network and subjected to seismic hazard. The gas system's performance is assessed through a flow-based analysis. The seismic hazard, the vulnerability assessment and the evaluation of the gas system's operational state are addressed with a simulation-based approach. The presence of two systems (buildings and gas network) proves the capability to handle system interdependencies and highlights that uncertainty in models/parameters related to one system can affect uncertainty in the output related to dependent systems.

This article includes a holistic methodology to account for nonlinear soil behavior and soil-foundation-structure interaction in a modular way. Using nonlinear dynamic analyses, we derive fragility curves for a wide set of building typologies and soil profiles, showing that soil behavior during strong shaking significantly affects the vulnerability of the soil-foundation-structure system. The influence of SSI is pronounced mostly for soft soil profiles, varying in a building-specific way. Post-processing of our results evolves into a set of fragility modifiers that enable risk analysts to massively account for soil-related and/or SSI effects in large-scale risk assessments.

19090,"New insights into the relationship between seismic intensity measures and nonlinear structural response This paper focuses on the probabilistic analysis of Intensity Measures (IMs) and Engineering Demand Parameters (EDPs) in the context of earthquake-induced ground motions. Several statistical properties, which are desirable in IMs when they are used to predict EDPs, have been analysed. Specifically, efficiency, sufficiency and steadfastness have been quantified for a set of IMs with respect to two EDPs: the maximum inter-storey drift ratio, MIDR, and the maximum floor acceleration, MFA. Steadfastness is a new statistical property proposed in this article, which is related to the ability of IMs to forecast EDPs for large building suites. In other words, this means that efficiency does not significantly vary when different types of buildings are simultanously considered in the statistical analyses. This property allows reducing the number of calculations when performing seismic risk estimations at urban level since, for instance, a large variety of fragility curves, representing specific building typologies, can be grouped together within a more generic one. The main sources of uncertainty involved in the calculation of the seismic risk have been considered in the analysis. To do so, the nonlinear dynamic responses of probabilistic multi-degree-of-freedom building models, subjected to a large data set of ground motion records, have been calculated. These models have been generated to simulate the dynamic behavior of reinforced concrete buildings whose number of stories vary from 3 to 13. 18 spectrum-, energy- and direct-accelerogram-based IMs have been considered herein. Then, from clouds of IM-EDP points, efficiency, sufficiency and steadfastness have been quantified. For MIDR, results show that IMs based on spectral velocity are more efficient and steadfast than the ones based on spectral acceleration; spectral velocity averaged in a range of periods, AvSv, has shown to be the most efficient IM with an adequate level of steadfastness. For MFA, spectral acceleration-based-IMs are more efficient than velocity-based ones. A comparison is also presented on the use of linear vs quadratic regression models, and their implications on the derivation of fragility functions. Concerning sufficiency, most of the 18 IMs analysed do not have this property. Nonetheless, multi-regression models have been employed to address this lack of sufficiency allowing to obtain a so-called ‘ideal’ IM. © 2021, The Author(s).

19660,"Preliminary observations from the 3 January 2017, M-W 5.6 Manu, Tripura (India) earthquake On 3 January 2017, a M-w 5.6 earthquake occurred in Dhalai district in Tripura (India), at 14:39:03 IST (09:09:03 UTC) with an epicentre at 24.018 degrees N +/- 4.9 km and 91.964 degrees E +/- 4.4 km, and a focal depth of 31 +/- 6.0 km. The focal mechanism solution determined after evaluating data from seismological observatories in India indicated a predominantly strike-slip motion on a steeply dipping plane. The estimated focal depth and focal mechanism solution places this earthquake in the Indian plate that lies beneath the overlying Indo-Burmese wedge. As in the 2016 Manipur earthquake, a strong motion record from Shillong, India, appears to suggest site amplification possibly due to topographic effects. In the epicentral region in Tripura, damage assessed from a field survey and from media reports indicated that the macroseismic intensity approached 6-7 EMS with damage also reported in adjacent parts of Bangladesh. A striking feature of this earthquake were the numerous reports of liquefaction that were forthcoming from fluvial locales in the epicentral region in Tripura, and at anomalous distances farther north in Bangladesh.

The Chinese Code for Seismic Design of Buildings (CCSDB) has evolved over time, however, there is still reported earthquake induced damage of newly designed RC buildings. Thus, to investigate modem Chinese seismic design code, three low-, mid- and high-rise RC frames were designed according to the 2010 CCSDB and the corresponding vulnerability curves were derived by computing a probabilistic seismic demand model (PSDM).The PSDM was computed by carrying out nonlinear time history analysis using thirty ground motions obtained from the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center. Finally, the PSDM was used to generate fragility curves for immediate occupancy, significant damage, and collapse prevention damage levels.

17991,"Fragility Curves and Methodology for Estimating Postearthquake Occupancy of Wood-Frame Single-Family Houses on a Regional Scale With the exception of older dwellings built on cripple walls, wood-frame single-family houses in California have shown adequate levels of safety against collapse in previous earthquakes. However, damage to chimneys and structural walls includes widespread types of damage that have resulted in houses being posted with yellow or red tags, restricting their postearthquake occupancy. By using analytical models, we develop fragility curves, sometimes also referred to as fragility functions, for estimating the probability of damage to masonry chimneys and severe damage to shear walls in wood-frame single-family houses as a function of the number of stories of the house, the year the chimney was built, and the ground motion intensity. Fragility curves are provided as a function of two different ground motion intensity measures: the 5%-damped average spectral pseudoacceleration at a period of 0.16 s, and the peak ground acceleration. The proposed fragility curves are used within a fully probabilistic methodology for estimating the number of wood-frame single-family houses with chimney and wall damage in Napa, California, due to the 2014 South Napa earthquake. Results are compared to estimates computed using three previously proposed methodologies and with empirical data collected after the earthquake.

16246,"Comparative flood damage model assessment: Towards a European approach There is a wide variety of flood damage models in use internationally, differing substantially in their approaches and economic estimates. Since these models are being used more and more as a basis for investment and planning decisions on an increasingly large scale, there is a need to reduce the uncertainties involved and develop a harmonised European approach, in particular with respect to the EU Flood Risks Directive. In this paper we present a qualitative and quantitative assessment of seven flood damage models, using two case studies of past flood events in Germany and the United Kingdom. The qualitative analysis shows that modelling approaches vary strongly, and that current methodologies for estimating infrastructural damage are not as well developed as methodologies for the estimation of damage to buildings. The quantitative results show that the model outcomes are very sensitive to uncertainty in both vulnerability (i.e. depth-damage functions) and exposure (i.e. asset values), whereby the first has a larger effect than the latter. We conclude that care needs to be taken when using aggregated land use data for flood risk assessment, and that it is essential to adjust asset values to the regional economic situation and property characteristics. We call for the development of a flexible but consistent European framework that applies best practice from existing models while providing room for including necessary regional adjustments. © 2012 Author(s).

A research team from the University of Udine (Italy) collected and reorganized these sheets inputting this information in the Fr.E.D.

Generally in the field of risk assessment of major accidents, a Probit analysis is applied to derive experimental relationships useful for the prediction of the accident's consequences. In particular, in this work, seismic damage curves, extrapolated for different typologies of residential masonry buildings, are presented. A combined use of these curves with the EMS98 and GSD scales of seismic damage is proposed to predict the damage scenarios, in terms of direct and indirect consequences, that a future earthquake could produce in an inhabited area with masonry building typologies similar to those present in the Friuli area. © 2009 - OGS.

17911,"Fragility analysis of existing unreinforced masonry buildings through a numerical-based methodology As an approach to the problem of seismic vulnerability evaluation of existing buildings using the predicted vul-nerability method, numerical models can be applied to define fragility curves of typical buildings which represent building classes. These curves can be then combined with the seismic hazard to calculate the seismic risk for a building class (or individual buildings). For some buildings types, mainly the unreinforced masonry structures, such fragility analysis is complicated and time consuming if a Finite Element-based method is used. The FEM model has to represent the structural geometry and relationships between different structural elements through element connectivity. Moreover, the FEM can face major challenges to represent large displacements and separations for progressive collapse simulations. Therefore, the Applied Element Method which combines the advantages of FEM with that of the Discrete Element Method in terms of accurately modelling a deformable continuum of discrete materials is used in this paper to perform the fragility analysis for unreinforced masonry buildings. To this end, a series of nonlinear dynamic analyses using the AEM has been per-formed for two unreinforced masonry buildings (a 6-storey stone masonry and a 4-storey brick masonry) using more than 50 ground motion records. Both in-plane and out-of-plane failure have been considered in the damage analysis. The dis-tribution of the structural responses and inter-storey drifts are used to develop spectral-based fragility curves for the five European Macroseismic Scale damage grades. © Karbassi and Lestuzzi; Licensee Bentham Open.

19687,"Probabilistic assessment of the seismic risk based on stiffness degradation The incremental dynamic analysis is a powerful tool for evaluating the seismic vulnerability and risk of buildings. It allows calculating the global damage of structures for different peak ground accelerations, PGA, and representing this result by means of damage curves. Such curves are currently used to obtain seismic risk scenarios at urban level. Even if the application of this method in a probabilistic environment requires a relevant computational effort, this has to be the reference method for determining those curves. Nevertheless, it would be of high practical interest to have a simpler method based, for instance, on pushover analysis, for assessing the seismic vulnerability and risk of buildings, which allows obtaining results similar to those based on the incremental dynamic analysis. Referring to the capacity-spectrum-based-methods, expert opinions have been used in previous researches for defining damage states thresholds starting from the yielding and the ultimate spectral displacement identified in the bilinear capacity spectrum. Therefore, we propose in this article a new procedure for defining the damage states thresholds, based on the stiffness degradation of reinforced concrete building, and a fully probabilistic approach is tackled by means of Monte Carlo simulations. It is demonstrated in the paper that the obtained results are in good agreement with those calculated using the incremental dynamic analysis. (C) 2013 CIMNE (Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya).

17333,"Empirical drift-fragility functions and loss estimation for infills in reinforced concrete frames under seismic loading Earthquakes that have occurred in the last twenty years in the Mediterranean area have had significant economic and social impacts. Most of the economic losses of reinforced concrete (RC) frames was due to nonstructural component damage, particularly masonry infills and partitions. Therefore, the seismic behaviour of masonry infills should be reliably characterized. The main goals of this study for a more reliable loss estimation for infilled RC frames are: (i) the analysis of the inter-story drift ratio (IDR) capacity at given damage states (DSs) with the aim to define drift-based fragility functions and (ii) analyse direct losses due to infill damage following seismic events. First, a database of experimental tests performed on 1-bay, 1-story scaled RC frames infilled with clay bricks or concrete blocks is collected. Drift-based fragility curves are obtained, which depend on the infill brick materials and properties. Then, the drift capacity threshold at each DS is correlated to the in-plane response of the infill panel to directly quantify the relationship that exists among them. The influence of openings on drift capacities is also evaluated. Then, seismic losses related to infills are computed, providing expected monetary losses depending on the infill typology. The required reparation activities and their costs are also listed. The bearing of each activity and cost at each DS is explicitly evaluated. Additionally, loss functions that directly depend on IDR demand are provided, thus fusing together the damage analysis and loss analysis. Finally, a simplified formulation for loss functions is proposed for a simple, practice-oriented loss calculation. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

21121,SEISMIC VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT OF A WIDESPREAD RC SHEAR WALL RESIDENTIAL BUILDING LOCATED IN BUCHAREST USING RESPONSE SURFACE METHODOLOGY Bucharest is a densely populated city and has a high seismic risk. A major part of the city's buildings have an inadequate seismic protection level. A widespread residential building called Section R totalizing thousands apartment units in Bucharest was assessed using Response Surface Methodology. The building was designed according to a low level seismic code. Response surface meta-models were obtained selecting the parameters with the highest influence on structural response using the Design of experiments. For the analyzed structure the most important uncertainties were considered the ones related to the material. Monte Carlo simulations were performed using probability distributions for the characteristic parameters of the structure. The cumulative distribution functions for the maximum interstorey drift were obtained in both longitudinal and transverse directions at various levels of peak ground acceleration. Finally the fragility curves were obtained using the performance levels provided by FEMA 356. seismic vulnerability  Response Surface Methodology  Monte Carlo simulations  design of experiments None,SEISMIC VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT OF A WIDESPREAD RC SHEAR WALL RESIDENTIAL BUILDING LOCATED IN BUCHAREST USING RESPONSE SURFACE METHODOLOGY,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12397565261008807,0.053264829182144285,0.02914968239226016,0.024098986368376603,Analytical
12591,"Analytical damage quantification method for residential developments subjected to hurricane wind hazards Hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones (hereafter referred to as ""hurricanes"") continue to have a significant impact on residential developments around the world. As more populations continue to migrate into the path of these costly natural hazards, it is becoming increasingly important to develop new methods to quantify damage to residential developments in order to increase the resilience of communities. One way to increase community resilience from a structural engineering standpoint is to limit the damage incurred by a residential development subjected to a hurricane wind event. Previous post-hurricane damage assessments have illustrated the integrity of the building envelope plays a key role in reducing or even eliminating the significant losses typically associated with hurricane wind hazards. In order to assess the post-hurricane state of a residential development, three failure modes common to residential building envelopes are implemented using the axioms of probability to implement an analytical damage quantification method. Results illustrating the implementation of the proposed method will be presented using a probabilistic building envelope failure assessment model applied to a residential development subjected to ten synthetic hurricane events each with a maximum mean wind speed equivalent to a 700-year return period wind speed. Benefits are twofold, as this research provides (1) a useful tool for assessing the state of physical residential developments with information readily available after post-hurricane damage assessments, and (2) the ability to determine the temporal status of a residential development during the recovery process, which is crucial to implement community life-cycle resilience assessments.

19713,"Probabilistic demand models and fragility curves for reinforced concrete frames Fragility curves are constructed to assess the seismic vulnerability of a hypothetical two-story reinforced concrete frame building designed only for gravity loads. Fragility curves are also developed for the same building modestly retrofitted by means of column strengthening. A Bayesian methodology is used to construct probabilistic demand models to predict the maximum inter-story drifts, given the spectral acceleration at the fundamental period of the building. The data for the models are obtained using two-dimensional inelastic time history analyses of the building for a suite of synthetic ground motions, developed for the Memphis region. The models are developed using both equality data and lower bound data, and are developed to properly account for both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties. In the absence of probabilistic capacity models for gravity load designed structures, capacity limit states are considered based on FEMA 356 guidelines and deterministic nonlinear pushover analyses. The results quantify the vulnerability of low-rise reinforced concrete frame buildings and show the effectiveness of seismic retrofitting in reducing the probability of failure. © ASCE.

18597,"Interpreting the socio-technical interactions within a wind damage-artificial neural network model for community resilience: Socio-Technical Interactions for Damage The use of machine learning has grown in popularity in various disciplines. Despite the popularity, the apparent 'black box' nature of such tools continues to be an area of concern. In this article, we attempt to unravel the complexity of this black box by exploring the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs), coupled with graph theory, to model and interpret the spatial distribution of building damage from extreme wind events at a community level. Structural wind damage is a topic that is mostly well understood for how wind pressure translates to extreme loading on a structure, how debris can affect that loading and how specific social characteristics contribute to the overall population vulnerability. While these themes are widely accepted, they have proven difficult to model in a cohesive manner, which has led primarily to physical damage models considering wind loading only as it relates to structural capacity. We take advantage of this modelling difficulty to reflect on two different ANN models for predicting the spatial distribution of structural damage due to wind loading. Through graph theory analysis, we study the internal patterns of the apparent black box of artificial intelligence of the models and show that social parameters are key to predict structural damage.

17998,"Fragility curves for any damage state based on capacity index For the adequate damage estimation in the earthquake risk management business, it is required to quantify the seismic vulnerability of the facilities, which is given in the form of fragility curves. Though a lot of fragility curves based on the damage records in Kobe earthquake are proposed, they are not suitable from the viewpoint of the risk management, since they can give us only limited damage state such as ""collapse"". This study aims to propose a method useful for a practical risk management to estimate fragility curves of any buildings. This study consists of two stages. The first one is to conduct dynamic response analysis with a Monte Carlo simulation(MCS). Thus we can evaluate the relationships between the characteristics of fragility curves such as the median and logarithmic standard deviation and the building attributes such as threshold of interstoly drift angle, seismic capacity index called ""Is-value"", and number of story. The attributes such as structural type, a soil category and design code is dealt with as given conditions due to non-successiveness. The second one is to derive a general expression of characteristics of fragility curves for any damage states by multiple regression analysis to the result of MCS. The accuracy of the proposed general formula is examined by comparing the results with those by Monte Carlo simulation. As a result we found that the median can be well estimated with relatively small error coefficients. Copyright © (2006) by Earthquake Engineering Research Institute.

17533,"Evaluation of Seismic Vulnerability of Hospitals in the Tehran Metropolitan Area The Tehran metropolitan area is extremely vulnerable to earthquakes due to the location of its active faults and its dense population. Assessing the probable damage of a high magnitude earthquake on buildings and facilities relies on a precise structural survey, which has an empirical basis depending on historic ground motions. The probability of damage and failure in discrete limits based on different ground motions is estimated by fragility curves. Using the most matching fragility curves for buildings in Tehran, the vulnerability of the hospitals in the capital, as one of the most critical structures in crisis management of disasters, was investigated in this study. Subsequently, the existing fragility curves, developed for Tehran and the other seismic prone countries such as Japan and the United States, were compared considering the typology of Tehran's hospitals. Finally, the possible damages for each hospital were calculated based on the most conservative fragility curve and the most pessimistic scenario, which were used to evaluate the seismic vulnerability of hospitals and health care systems for different damage states. After zoning the damage of therapeutic areas of Tehran, it was observed that at least 2% to 10% damage occurred in all hospitals of Tehran, and none of the healthcare centers would remain structurally undamaged after a strong earthquake with the moment magnitude of 7 or more. In addition, the healthcare buildings could be prone to significant structural damage, especially in southern parts, which necessitates proactive management plans for Tehran metropolitan area. seismic vulnerability  fragility curve  seismic evaluations  seismic damage  earthquake crisis management None",Evaluation of Seismic Vulnerability of Hospitals in the Tehran Metropolitan Area,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08356817026210592,0.12112631865816728,0.04523321979689243,0.004162283691322962,Empirical
19444,"Performance of buildings under earthquakes in Barcelona, Spain The seismic risk of the buildings of Barcelona, Spain, is analyzed by using a method based on the capacity spectrum. The seismic hazard in the area of the city is described by means of the reduced 5% damped elastic response spectrum. Obtaining fragility curves for the most important building types of an urban center requires an important amount of information about the structures and the use of nonlinear structural analysis tools. The information on the buildings of Barcelona was obtained by collecting, arranging, improving, and completing the database of the housing and current buildings. The buildings existing in Barcelona are mainly of two types: unreinforced masonry structures and reinforced concrete buildings with waffled slab floors. In addition, the Arc-View software was used to create a GIS tool for managing the collected information to develop seismic risk scenarios. This study shows that the vulnerability of the buildings is significant and therefore, in spite of the medium to low seismic hazard in the area of the city, the expected seismic risk is considerable. © 2006 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering.

16193,"Collapse mode-based building fragility against tsunami This paper presents tsunami fragility curves for low-rise reinforced concrete buildings in Japan considering collapse modes, such as overturning and sliding, based on the examination of the database of damaged buildings during the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. Fragility curves are assumed to exhibit a log-normal distribution for the estimate of the median and the log-standard deviation. One of the difficulties for mode-based fragility estimation is that it is difficult to identify the most contributing collapse mode beforehand. The most appropriate method is selected using a multi-nominal likelihood function (Nakamura & Ugata, 2009) so that no assumption is needed about the relationship between each collapse mode. Moreover, the proposed fragility curves include statistical uncertainty derived from using a limited number of damaged data. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

This is achieved by an original definition of vulnerability functions for multi-hazard input and a dynamic cumulative damage model. Factors affecting the variability of the final scenario are highlighted. The results show the high sensitivity of hazard combinations in time and space distribution and address how to mitigate building vulnerability to subsequent eruptive phenomena [Baxter, P., Spence, R., Zuccaro, G., 2008-this issue. Risk mitigation and emergency measures at Vesuvius]. The first part of the work describes the numerical modelling and the methodology adopted to evaluate the resistance of buildings under the combined action of volcanic phenomena. Those considered here for this multi-hazard approach are limited to the following: earthquakes, pyroclastic flows and ash falls. Because of the lack of a systematic and extensive database of building damages observed after eruptions of such intensity of the past, approaches to this work must take a hybrid form of stochastic and deterministic analyses, taking into account written histories of volcanic eruptions and expertise from field geologists to build up a semi-deterministic model of the possible combinations of the above hazards that are situated both in time and space. Once a range of possible scenarios has been determined, a full stochastic method can be applied to find a sub-set of permutations and combinations of possible effects. This preliminary study of identification of the possible combination of the phenomena, subdividing them into those which are discrete and those which are continuous in time and space, enables consideration the vulnerability functions of the combinations to be feasible.

Volcanol. vol. 67,292-313] the authors investigated, by means of experimental and analytical methods, the limiting resistance of masonry and reinforced concrete buildings assuming each action separately. In this work the first attempt to estimate the response of the buildings to the volcanic seismic action or to the lateral dynamic pressure due to pyroclastic flow combined with an extra vertical load on the roof due to ash fall is performed. The results show that up to a certain limit of ash fall deposit, the increment of structure weight increases the resistance of a building to pyroclastic flow action while it reduces its seismic resistance. In particular the collapse of the top storey of R.C. buildings having large roofs could occur by accumulation of ash and a strong earthquake. Seismic and pyroclastic flow vulnerability of tall R.C. and masonry buildings with rigid floors is less sensitive to ash fall load combination. The model allows any sequence of events (earthquake, ash fall, pyroclastic flow) to be assumed and evaluates the spatial distribution of the cumulative impact at a given time. Single impact scenarios have been derived and mapped on a suitable grid into which the territory around Vesuvius has been subdivided. The buildings have been classified according to the constructional characteristics that mostly affect their response under the action of the phenomena; hence the vulnerability distribution of the buildings are assigned to each cell of the grid and by taking advantage from the combined vulnerability functions the impact is derived at time t. In the paper the following impact simulations are presented:-single cases of selected seismic sequence during the unrest phase (Sub-Plinian I)-ash fall damage distribution compatible to a Sub-Plinian I eruption-pyroclastic flow cumulative damage scenarios for selected cases (Sub-Plinian I). The model also allows either Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the most probable final scenario or maximisation of some parameter sensitive to Civil Protection preparedness. The analysis of the results derived for a Sub-Plinian I-like eruption has shown the importance of the seismic intensities released during the unrest phase that could interfere with the evacuation of the area and the huge number of partial collapses (roofs) due to ash fall. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

20692,"Seismic fragility evaluation of multi-branch piping systems installed in critical low-rise buildings The failure of nonstructural components such as piping, ceiling, mechanical and electrical equipments led to operational and functional problems in structural system during the past severe earthquakes. Consequently, in the last few decades, a reduction of the damage to nonstructural components or an improvement on the performance of nonstructural component has emerged as a key area of research. The primary objective of this research was to develop the seismic fragility of the piping system incorporating the multi T-joint branch piping systems.

The result of this study revealed that the conditional probability of failure to the piping system on each floor level in critical facilities increased with increased level of floor and in fact, floor level in low-rise buildings can tune the fragilities between the building and the piping system.

13104,"Mechanics-based fragility curves for Italian residential URM buildings Seismic risk assessment at the territorial level is now widely recognised as essential for countries with intense seismic activity, such as Italy. Academia is called to give its contribution in order to synergically deepen the knowledge about the various components of this risk, starting from the complex evaluation of vulnerability of the built heritage. In line with this, a mechanics-based seismic fragility model for Italian residential masonry buildings was developed and presented in this paper. This model is based on the classification of the building stock in macro-typologies, defined by age of construction and number of storeys, which being information available at national level, allow simulating damage scenarios and carrying out risk analyses on a territorial scale. The model is developed on the fragility of over 500 buildings, sampled according to national representativeness criteria and analysed through the Vulnus_4.0 software. The calculated fragility functions were extended on the basis of a reference model available in the literature, which provides generic fragilities for the EMS98 vulnerability classes, thus obtaining a fragility model defined on the five EMS98 damage states. Lastly, to assess the reliability of the proposed model, this was used to simulate damage scenarios due to the 2009 L’Aquila earthquake. Overall, the comparison between model results and observed damage showed a good fit, proving the model effectiveness. © 2020, The Author(s).

22233,"Vulnerability assessment of a high-rise building subjected to mainshock-aftershock sequences Strong aftershocks have the potential to further aggravate the damage state of structures, and much less attention has been given to the seismic vulnerability of high-rise buildings than that of low- to medium-rise buildings. This study assesses the seismic vulnerability of a 32-storey frame-core tube building by performing the incremental dynamic analysis on the material-based three-dimensional numerical model. A storey damage model based on the material damage is developed using the weighted average method. Eighteen recorded mainshock-aftershock sequences, whose mainshock records match the target spectrum, are selected. The results indicate that the developed stroey damage model can effectively reflect the additional damage induced by aftershocks. Strong aftershocks have high potential to change the location of weak storeys. Notably, shifts of weak storeys are observed in more than 30% of aftershocks with relative spectral acceleration of 0.8. As the mainshock-induced damage state becomes more severe, the mainshock-damaged building becomes increasingly fragile to the aftershock excitation and more sensitive to aftershock intensities. The probability of exceeding severe damage state increases from 35.3% to 62.1% due to the effects of strong aftershocks. The results in this study can provide supports to the seismic resilience assessment of this high-rise building. aftershock  damage model  high-rise building  resilience  vulnerability  weak storey STRENGTH REDUCTION FACTOR  PLASTIC-DAMAGE MODEL  GROUND MOTIONS  EARTHQUAKE  SPECTRA  FRAMES",Vulnerability assessment of a high-rise building subjected to mainshock-aftershock sequences,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14992296908864117,0.07385988609530784,0.02293107707459606,0.01234265691757096,Analytical

15069,"A component-level methodology to evaluate the seismic repair costs of infills and services for Italian RC buildings The reliable estimation of seismic losses due to damage to buildings is paramount for the post-emergency management and the planning of recovery activities. For residential reinforced concrete (RC) infilled buildings, a significant role in the computation of seismic loss is played by non-structural components, above all infills, partitions and services, as shown in past earthquakes. In this work, a component-based methodology is proposed to assess seismic losses for residential RC buildings in Mediterranean region. The attention is focused on the repairing activities for masonry infills (typical enclosure or partitions elements in Italian and Mediterranean RC buildings), and for services (plumbing systems, electric equipment, floor/wall tiles…), commonly enclosed within the infill panels for the considered building typology. The described methodology can be used starting from the expected damage level to infills and partitions. It adopts given repair unit costs at different damage states of infills. The loss estimation methodology has been, first, validated by comparing predicted and actual repair costs for specific case-study buildings damaged by L’Aquila (Italy) 2009 earthquake. Then, the methodology has been applied to a wide dataset of RC buildings (about 2500 residential buildings) damaged by L’Aquila earthquake available from the literature, to show its possible application at a large-scale level. A good agreement between observed and predicted costs is obtained both for specific case-study buildings and for the wider building stock, especially when damage to structural components is very limited. © 2020, The Author(s).

16091,"Catastrophe loss modelling of storm-surge flood risk in eastern England Probabilistic catastrophe loss modelling techniques, comprising a large stochastic set of potential storm-surge flood events, each assigned an annual rate of occurrence, have been employed for quantifying risk in the coastal flood plain of eastern England. Based on the tracks of the causative extratropical cyclones, historical storm-surge events are categorized into three classes, with distinct windfields and surge geographies. Extreme combinations of 'tide with surge' are then generated for an extreme value distribution developed for each class. Fragility curves are used to determine the probability and magnitude of breaching relative to water levels and wave action for each section of sea defence. Based on the time-history of water levels in the surge, and the simulated configuration of breaching, flow is time-stepped through the defences and propagated into the flood plain using a 50 m horizontal-resolution digital elevation model. Based on the values and locations of the building stock in the flood plain, losses are calculated using vulnerability functions linking flood depth and flood velocity to measures of property loss. The outputs from this model for a UK insurance industry portfolio include 'loss exceedence probabilities' as well as 'average annualized losses', which can be employed for calculating coastal flood risk premiums in each postcode. © 2005 The Royal Society.

19057,"Multi-variable flood damage modelling with limited data using supervised learning approaches Flood damage assessment is usually done with damage curves only dependent on the water depth. Several recent studies have shown that supervised learning techniques applied to a multi-variable data set can produce significantly better flood damage estimates. However, creating and applying a multi-variable flood damage model requires an extensive data set, which is rarely available, and this is currently holding back the widespread application of these techniques. In this paper we enrich a data set of residential building and contents damage from the Meuse flood of 1993 in the Netherlands, to make it suitable for multi-variable flood damage assessment. Results from 2-D flood simulations are used to add information on flow velocity, flood duration and the return period to the data set, and cadastre data are used to add information on building characteristics. Next, several statistical approaches are used to create multi-variable flood damage models, including regression trees, bagging regression trees, random forest, and a Bayesian network. Validation on data points from a test set shows that the enriched data set in combination with the supervised learning techniques delivers a 20% reduction in the mean absolute error, compared to a simple model only based on the water depth, despite several limitations of the enriched data set. We find that with our data set, the tree-based methods perform better than the Bayesian network. © Author(s) 2017.

18662,"Joint Seismic and Scour Fragility Assessment of a Steel Building Incorporating Soil-Structure Interaction This paper focuses on the development of joint seismic and scour fragility function of a three-story existing steel moment resisting frame structure in the Central United States. The structure dimensions with beam and column details were obtained from the design plan from the building owner. With all the information, a three-dimensional (3D) model of the structure with soil springs reflecting the soil-structure interaction behaviors during an earthquake was created through commercially available finite element software. To account for joint seismic and scour risk, a total of forty eight synthetic ground motions having different spectral accelerations (Sa) were used, and the soil springs were progressively removed. Numerous nonlinear time history analyses reflecting the effects of scour effects by adjusting the removed soil spring number was conducted to determine peak inter-story drifts of the structure simultaneously subjected to the ground motions. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-based three performance levels (i.e., immediate occurrence, life safety, and collapse prevention) were considered for the creation of joint seismic and scour fragility functions. Significant findings show that the joint seismic and scour vulnerability of the structure increased as they become more damaged due to the reduced resistant forces from the removal of soil springs over a broad spectrum of Sa. © ASCE.

19860,Qualification of seismic risk studies on the basis of instrumentally verified vulnerability functions for R.C. Building types Realistic and reliable risk scenarios for master plan need a broad database to allocate empirical vulnerability and/or analytical fragility functions for the damage assessment. In any case the engineer-assigned (most probable) vulnerability or building type specific fragility function have to consider the uncertainty in building response characteristic and the particularities of the local construction practice. The comparison of available fragility functions shows the demand on vulnerability (fragility) functions which appropriately represent the behavior of the building types being representative for the target area. The distinction of the building stock into building types is emphasized as an essential step before the suitable fragility function of for the risk study can be selected. In this paper the applied building typology to the building stock of the study area Antakya will be presented.

18914,"Modeling of strong ground motion during the 1992 Cairo earthquake in the urban area northern Greater of Cairo, Egypt The 1992 Cairo earthquake originated from Dahshour seismic zone at an epicentral distance of about 25km southwest of Cairo. Regardless of its relatively moderate magnitude (Mb=5.8), it caused extensive property damage besides injuries and loss of lives. The significant damage of this earthquake was probably associated with amplification of seismic waves due to local site effects. Liquefaction was observed at many sites near the epicenter. There are no records of strong ground motion at the damaged area during this earthquake. The main shock was recorded only by the local Kattamya station (KEG) constructed in limestone rock site at about 46–48km east of Cairo. In the present work, the strong ground motion during 1992 Cairo earthquake was analyzed and the possible causes of damage and structural failure were discussed. The study area is located at the southern part of Cairo city, holding heavy population and many public structures and strategic buildings. The ground motion parameters in terms of peak ground acceleration (PGA), peak ground velocity (PGV), and pseudo-spectral acceleration (PSA) were estimated for each site in the study area and in the KEG site. The site-dependent spectral models together with the stochastic technique were applied for this purpose, using the Fourier amplitude spectrum (FAS) source scaling, attenuation model, and the site amplification functions. The peak ground acceleration of the studied area, comprising 89 sites in northern great of Cairo (Qalyoub city) was calculated. The calculated peak ground acceleration values indicate the sites of high values of peak ground acceleration which are also characterized by high ground motion amplification factors. The ground motion, which is presented in this study, is highly amplified by the soil layer covering the area. Otherwise, the surface layer must be totally removed before construction of the buildings to avoid its large amplification to the ground motion.

FEMA P-58 provides engineers, a practical tool for the performance seismic assessment of buildings. In this study, FEMA P-58 is applied to a typical Italian pre-1970 reinforced concrete frame building, characterized by plain rebars as steel reinforcement and masonry infills and partitions. Given that suitable tools for these buildings are missing in FEMA P-58, specific fragility curves and loss functions are first developed. Next, building performance is evaluated following a time-based assessment approach.

Numerical models were developed in OpenSees to understand the seismic performance of the structures. These models accounted for strength and stiffness degradation through appropriate representations of the beam-column connection behaviours, which were calibrated against experimental results available in the literature. The behaviour of the buildings was evaluated through pushover and nonlinear time history analyses. The pushover analysis results showed that the 1960s and 2010 steel MRFs of both cities exhibited strong-column-weak-beam failure mode. The 1980s steel MRFs of both cities showed soft-storey mechanism. Fragility curves were developed for the steel MRFs based on the seismic demands evaluated using nonlinear time history analyses, which can be used for regional seismic impact assessment studies in the future. © 2015, National Research Council of Canada, All Rights Reserved.

17904,"Fragility analysis of a mass-timber frame structure with ring-doweled moment-resisting connections The nonlinear behaviour of connections between structural elements is critical to the performance of mass-timber structures under seismic loads. However, limited work has been developed in nonlinear modelling and fragility assessment of mass-timber structures. To improve the accuracy of this approach, in particular when considering structures with ring-doweled moment-resisting connections, a nonlinear modelling approach and fragility assessment are proposed and a prototype example of a three-story building is analysed herein as a case study. For the case study, connections and members were designed following the prescriptions in Eurocode 5 and Eurocode 8, considering a high ductility structure. The mechanical properties of the structure are modelled as random variables to evaluate the impact of uncertainty on the prediction of the structural performance, in particular, on the probability of occurrence of ductile and brittle failure modes. The structure is studied under both nonlinear static analysis and multi-record incremental dynamic analysis. From these, fragility curves for different damage levels are computed and a q-factor is proposed. Results indicate that the requirements of Eurocode 5 and Eurocode 8 are sufficient to guarantee adequate performance for this type of structure, albeit these may be overconservative. Moreover, it is shown that uncertainties in material properties have a significant impact on the collapse capacity of these structures. © WCTE 2018 Committee.

19003,"Multihazard Damage and Loss Assessment of Bridges in a Highway Network Subjected to Earthquake and Tsunami Hazards The objective of this study is to examine and compare the vulnerabilities of highway bridges to the combined effects of earthquake shaking, ground failure, and tsunami loading. Earthquake-induced ground shaking, ground failure (e.g., landslides and liquefaction), and tsunami inundation fragility functions are combined with regional hazard data to estimate the damage to bridges in a highway network, direct economic loss, and reduction in traffic capacity. The proposed framework is applied to all bridges listed in the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) and located in the state of Oregon for several earthquake scenarios developed for the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. A parametric study is performed to understand the sensitivity of economic loss and postearthquake traffic capacity with respect to various fragility function classes as well as the parameters defining these fragility curves. Results show that the predicted damage varies substantially depending on the class of fragility function used. In addition, the loss estimates show significant sensitivity with respect to parameters defining the fragility functions, particularly the resistance models, emphasizing the need to develop specific and systematic regional fragility curves for bridges. The results also indicate that when ground failure and tsunami inundation are jointly considered, there is a significant increase in the loss estimates when compared to the estimates obtained from when ground shaking is considered alone.

20883,"Seismic performance of reinforced concrete building in Guwahati city, northeast India The seismic risk of reinforced concrete building frame located in the Guwahati City of northeast India is evaluated. To do so, we first conduct a site-specific probabilistic seismic hazard analysis to obtain hazard curve and implement proper selection of ground motion records for nonlinear time history analyses (NLTHA). Subsequently, the NLTHA of the building frame is performed to obtain the drift demand for any particular ground motion level. As the recorded accelerograms in the region are limited, the synthetic and artificial ground motion data are also generated to supplement the data base. Thereafter, the probabilistic structural capacity parameters at various limit states are obtained from random pushover analyses. Based on the knowledge of seismic hazard, demand, and capacity parameters, fragility curves are obtained corresponding to different structural performance levels. The annual probability of failure of the representative example frame is also estimated. The results of the seismic risk analysis indicate that a medium-rise reinforced concrete building frame in the study area with moderate fundamental period is most likely to perform beyond its elastic range. However, such structures designed according to the Indian codes are expected to be sufficient enough to prevent life-threatening risk and complete collapse. © 2017 Sharif University of Technology.

17138,"Earthquake vulnerability of school buildings: Probabilistic structural fragility analyses The study presents probabilistic structural fragility assessment of public school buildings in Istanbul, which were constructed based on a standardized/typical project. The typical structure is a four-story, reinforced concrete shear wall building with moment resisting frames. Derivation of fragility functions rely on nonlinear dynamic analyses through Monte Carlo simulations. Nonlinear dynamic analyses are initially performed for a fully deterministic structural model based on the blueprints of the typical school building project. Uncertainties are introduced in different analysis cases following a modified version of the algorithm presented in Smyth et al. (2004) [21], which considers the effect of the random distribution of the parameters using a Monte Carlo approach. Aleatory uncertainties concerning material properties (i.e. compressive strength of concrete, yield strength of reinforcing steel and concrete density), geometrical characteristics (i.e. span lengths and story heights) and cross sectional dimensions of beams, columns and shear walls as well as epistemic uncertainty in the direction of ground motion excitation are considered. Statistical distributions for the parameters considered are obtained from in-situ measurements and material sampling tests. Fragility functions are produced in terms of peak ground acceleration and velocity as well as of the elastic spectral displacement at the first vibration period of the building. Mean damage ratios are calculated from the derived fragility functions. They are further compared to mean damage ratios calculated for similar building typologies provided in HAZUS-MH technical manual and in Istanbul building inventory.

13213,"Probabilistic assessment of damage and losses on buildings under strong winds in Mexico The article presents a probabilistic criteria for the damage and loss assessment of buildings exposed to strong wind hazard. The criteria include the development of fragility curves, within the Federal Emergency Management Agency style, for appropriate damage states on a hotel building and contents due to the loss of nonstructural elements, like facades and the partial or total loss of contents because of water infiltration. The loss estimation includes loss components like the business interruption due to repairs/reconstruction work and, throughout a new estimation that considers mitigation measures to upgrade the building, it is shown that these measures reduce the loss in a significant level. The probabilistic description of wind-induced pressure on facades and windows resorts on the wind velocity distribution, and their resistances consider data and statistics from manufacturers. The calculation of failure probabilities makes use of Monte Carlo simulations for the considered modes: windows/façade anchorage failure, glass braking due to wind pressure and impact of airborne debris. The probabilistic distribution of rainfall, given the occurrence of a hurricane and the subsequent water infiltration, serves to assess damages on structures under strong wind hazard. A hotel building recently damaged by the hurricane Odile in Baja California Sur, México is used to illustrate the formulation.

A large number of buildings, mostly wooden houses, were damaged. This study developed fragility curves of buildings using the damage survey data provided by the Uki City government. The damage ratios of buildings were investigated from the viewpoints of the structural material and the construction period. As the result, the damage ratio of wooden buildings was found to be larger than those of other structural materials, and the damage ratios of major, moderate+, and moderate-got smaller as the construction period became newer. Empirical fragility curves of buildings for Uki City were constructed based on the damage survey data and the estimated peak ground velocity (PGV). Compared with the result of the previous study for Mashiki Town due the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, the major damage ratios of wooden buildings for Uki City was shown in a lower level than those for Mashiki Town in the same PGV. The fragility curves for Uki City were obtained using the damage survey data in the smaller PGV range than that for Mashiki Town, thus the regression results reflected the damage trend in the small PGVs. The fragility curves for Uki City and Mashiki Town due the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake were compared with those for Nishinomiya City and Nada Ward due the 1995 Kobe earthquake.

High PGAs (>0.6 g) were registered in all cases. The epicentres were located in an agriculture region and close to small towns and villages. Nearly 9500 residential buildings were affected. A great deal of damage occurred but there was no loss of life. Insurance against natural disasters is obligatory for all buildings in Iceland and they are all registered in a comprehensive property database. Therefore, after each quake a field survey was carried out where damage and repair costs were estimated for every structure. Most of the damage was observed in the near-fault area (0-10 km) but at longer distances it was significantly less. The damage in the two M(w)6.5 events was considerably greater than in the M(w)6.3 event. In all the events a high proportion of buildings were undamaged, even in the near-fault area. The main damage was non-structural, in interior walls and flooring. New buildings built after implementation of seismic codes performed better than those built pre-code. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

15760,"Assessment of hurricane-induced internal damage to low-rise buildings in the Florida Public Hurricane Loss Model Interior damage is a significant portion of overall building damage caused by hurricanes. Most of the vulnerability models in the literature assess interior damage by expert opinion or with empirical functions of the envelope damage. Interior damage to buildings at low to moderate wind speeds is mainly caused by the ingress of water through breaches in the building's envelope. The parameters that govern water intrusion include wind speed, rain rate, rain duration, raindrop size distributions, exterior building damage, and shape of the building. The amount of ingressed water is proportional to the breach sizes as well as the uncertain meteorological phenomena. This paper presents a novel approach to estimate the interior building damage caused by hurricanes by simulating the co-occurrence of wind, rain and envelope damage and by converting ingressed water into interior damage. The simulation rationale is described and some preliminary qualitative results are introduced via a sample case.

15132,"A framework for estimating water ingress due to hurricane rainfall Hurricanes can have adverse effects on residential communities and pose a significant risk to their economic prosperity. The ingress of water into a building due to wind-driven rain (WDR) and inland flooding can cause significant damage leading to downtime or temporary loss of housing. Existing frameworks focus on estimating the amount of water ingress due to WDR and inland flooding separately. This paper provides a comprehensive framework that considers both WDR and inland flooding when estimating the amount of water ingress into residential buildings due to hurricane rainfall. The framework estimates the water ingress due to WDR by combining the WDR intensity with the perforated area of the building envelopes. The intensity of the WDR is quantified using an Eulerian Multi-phase Model. The buildings’ envelope is considered susceptible to damage from the impact of windborne debris and excessive dynamic wind pressure. The framework to characterize and quantify inland flooding uses a coupled hydrologic-hydrodynamic model to estimate the inundation depth at each building. A case study consisting of a residential community in Houston, TX, which is subject to Hurricane Harvey illustrates the ability of the framework to capture the influence of WDR and inland flooding when quantifying water ingress.

While many complex computer models have been developed for flood risk assessment, they require highly trained personnel to prepare the necessary input (hazard, inventory of the built environment, and vulnerabilities) and analyze model outputs. As such, tools which utilize open-source software or are built within popular desktop software programs are appealing alternatives. The recently developed Rapid Risk Evaluation (ER2) application runs scenario based loss assessment analyses in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. User input is limited to a handful of intuitive drop-down menus utilized to describe the building type, age, occupancy and the expected water level. In anticipation of local depth damage curves and other needed vulnerability parameters, those from the U.S. FEMA's Hazus-Flood software have been imported and temporarily accessed in conjunction with user input to display exposure and estimated economic losses related to the structure and the content of the building. Building types and occupancies representative of those most exposed to flooding in Fredericton (New Brunswick) were introduced and test flood scenarios were run. The algorithm was successfully validated against results from the Hazus-Flood model for the same building types and flood depths.

22134,"Use of the model parameter sensitivity analysis for the probabilistic-based seismic assessment of existing buildings Seismic assessment of existing buildings is usually treated by international codes and guidelines through a semi-probabilistic approach based on the use of the so-called confidence factor (CF). Many authors revealed the inadequacy of such an approach, proposing alternative procedures based on: the updated calibration of the CF values together with its application to a parameter better representative of the structural response than the material strength, as usually adopted by codes; or the fully probabilistic approach by explicitly considering the propagation of uncertainties. Although the latter constitutes the most rigorous approach, it is still computationally demanding and difficult to be integrated as standard tool in the engineering practice. In this paper, the model parameter sensitivity analysis is proposed to support the seismic assessment in various aspects such as: pointing out, in an explicit way, the influence each uncertain parameter has on the structural response; supporting the set of an effective investigation plan; computing the essential parameters for a probabilistic-based verification on basis of a limited number of analyses. To the latter aim, the results from the model parameter sensitivity analysis executed according to the star design with central point approach are used to determine the median intensity measure (IM LS ) and, with the help of the surface response technique, its dispersion (β LS ), that are the two parameters of the fragility curve representing the capacity in the assessment. The proposed methodology is applied on two case studies, representative of existing URM buildings. Firstly, the IM LS and β LS values are calculated and thus compared, for the aim of validation, with the reference ones obtained from nonlinear static analyses performed on a large number of models generated using Monte Carlo simulations. Results obtained show a good estimate of the fragility curve parameters, compared to the rigorous probabilistic approach, highlighting the potential of the procedure proposed. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

18312,"Identification of key components for developing building types for risk assessment against wind loadings: The case of Cebu Province, Philippines Tropical cyclones have caused significant damage to low-rise buildings in the Philippines, with severe to complete damages observed in non-engineered houses. As a response, vulnerability assessments need to be conducted to identify strategies that will improve the resilience of buildings against the severe wind. This paper presents a methodology for identifying critical key building components and building typologies that can be used for a component-based vulnerability assessment against extreme wind loads. The paper discusses the recommended survey preparations, survey proper and post-survey activities needed to produce vulnerability and fragility curves. The paper focuses on collecting data wherein buildings can be classified into key building typologies based on their key critical components. Furthermore, a discussion on the application of the methodology in the province of Cebu is presented, wherein four new building classifications are proposed in addition to the existing key building typologies identified in previous research for the Philippines. The new classifications are as follows: Reinforced concrete moment frame, open/without walls (C1o), Steel moment frame, open/without walls (S1o), Wood frame with CHB walls (W4), and wall: bottom half concrete and upper half wood (W5). The amended key building types for the Philippines can then be used for risk assessments initiatives wherein the results can be implemented in disaster risk reduction mitigation strategies (DRRM). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd Building typology  Critical building component  Risk assessment  Severe wind None","Identification of key components for developing building types for risk assessment against wind loadings: The case of Cebu Province, Philippines",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1137748070742791,0.07103166656630185,0.022445493575774134,0.013547309767796835,Analytical
21827,"The prediction of flood damage in coastal urban areas The increase of impervious surfaces in the urban area triggers a flood. A flood occurs area with a dense population that will result in a lot of damage. The flood simulation itself is not adequate to calculate the flood damage, as it only shows the flood depth and extent. It needs the capability of mapping software to map the vulnerable area. Accordingly, the research study's aim is to propose the methodology to predict the flood damage on the coastal urban area by combining the flood simulation model with GIS mapping software. MIKE FLOOD and ArcGIS were used to represent the flood simulation model and mapping software. The flood depth and inundation area were calculated with MIKE FLOOD; meanwhile, the residential house was mapped using ArcGIS. Both of MIKE FLOOD and ArcGIS were then combined to obtain the flood depth in each residential house. Moreover, to value the flood damage in monetary terms, the depth-damage curve and average house prices were applied. The result shows that the majority of the inundation caused by riverine flood and coastal area is the place where the largest inundation area occurs. As the flood appears in a residential area, the flood damage of the residential building in terms of annual average damage (AAD) was obtained with the amount of $8,716,227.67 calculated from six AEPs (50%, 20%, 10%, 5%, 2%, and 1%). © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

20672,"Seismic fragility curves of single storey RC precast structures by comparing different Italian codes The seismic events in Northern Italy, May 2012, have revealed the seismic vulnerability of typical Italian precast industrial buildings. The aim of this paper is to present a seismic fragility model for Italian RC precast buildings, to be used in earthquake loss estimation and seismic risk assessment by comparing two building typologies and three different codes: D.M. 303-1975, D.M. 16-01-1996 and current Italian building code that has been released in 2008. Based on geometric characteristics and design procedure applied, ten different building classes were identified. A Monte Carlo simulation was performed for each building class in order to generate the building stock used for the development of fragility curves trough analytical method. The probabilistic distributions of geometry were mainly obtained from data collected from 650 field surveys, while the material properties were deduced from the code in place at the time of construction or from expert opinion. The structures were modelled in 2D frameworks; since the past seismic events have identified the beam-column connection as the weakest element of precast buildings, two different modelling solutions were adopted to develop fragility curves: a simple model with post processing required to detect connection collapse and an innovative modelling solution able to reproduce the real behaviour of the connection during the analysis.

18651,"Is flow velocity a significant parameter in flood damage modelling? Flow velocity is generally presumed to influence flood damage. However, this influence is hardly quantified and virtually no damage models take it into account. Therefore, the influences of flow velocity, water depth and combinations of these two impact parameters on various types of flood damage were investigated in five communities affected by the Elbe catchment flood in Germany in 2002. 2-D hydraulic models with high to medium spatial resolutions were used to calculate the impact parameters at the sites in which damage occurred. A significant influence of flow velocity on structural damage, particularly on roads, could be shown in contrast to a minor influence on monetary losses and business interruption. Forecasts of structural damage to road infrastructure should be based on flow velocity alone. The energy head is suggested as a suitable flood impact parameter for reliable forecasting of structural damage to residential buildings above a critical impact level of 2m of energy head or water depth. However, general consideration of flow velocity in flood damage modelling, particularly for estimating monetary loss, cannot be recommended. © Author(s) 2009.

22150,"Using FloodRisk GIS freeware for uncertainty analysis of direct economic flood damages in Italy The considerable increase in flood damages in Europe in recent decades has shifted attention from flood protection to flood risk management. Assessments of expected damage provide critical information for flood risk management efforts. The evaluation of potential damages under different flood scenarios through quantification of their ability to provide relative short-, medium- and long-term risk reduction, supports decision-makers in discriminating among several alternative mitigation actions. End-users should be aware of, and knowledgeable about, the limitations and uncertainties of such analyses, as well-informed decisions regarding efficient and sustainable flood risk management will become increasingly relevant under future climate and socio-economic changes. In this context, a method was developed to identify and quantify the role of the input parameters in the uncertainty of the potential flood economic damage assessment in urban areas with low sloping/flat terrain and complex topography using a GIS-based, free and open-source software called Floodrisk. Sets of plausible input parameters for the model's two flood loss modelling subroutines (hydraulic modelling and damage estimation) were dynamically combined to quantify the contribution of their inner parameters to the total damage assessment uncertainty. To estimate the contributions of each input to overall model uncertainty, the combination of input parameters that minimized the error in the spatial distribution assessment of the extensive damages affecting (downtown) Albenga (Italy), enumerated after the historical Centa River flood of November 5, 1994, was taken as a reference. In this specific case, a high epistemic uncertainty for the damage estimation module was noted for the specific type and form of the damage functions used. In the absence of region-specific depth-damage functions, the vulnerability curves were adapted from a range of geographic and socio-economic studies. Given the strong dependence of model uncertainty and sensitivity to local characteristics, the epistemic uncertainty associated with the risk estimate was reduced by introducing additional information into the risk analysis. Implementing newly developed site-specific curves and a more detailed classification of the construction typology of the buildings at risk, led to a substantial decrease in modelling uncertainty, along with a decrease in the sensitivity of the flood loss estimation to the uncertainty in the depth-damage function input parameter. These findings indicated the need to produce and openly disseminate data in order to develop micro-scale risk analysis through site-specific vulnerability curves. Moreover, this study highlighted the urgent need for research on the development and implementation of methods and models for the assimilation of uncertainties in decision-making processes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

21202,"Seismic vulnerability assessment to slight damage based on experimental modal parameters The aim of this paper is to adjust behaviour models for each class of structure for vulnerability assessment by using ambient vibration. A simple model based on frequencies, mode shapes and damping, taken from ambient vibrations, allows computation of the response of the structures and comparison of inter-storey drifts with the limits found in the literature for the slight damage grade, considered here as the limit of elastic behaviour. Two complete methodologies for building fragility curves are proposed: (1) using a multi-degree of freedom system including higher modes and full seismic ground-motion and (2) using a single-degree of freedom model considering the fundamental mode f0 of the structure and ground-motion displacement response spectra SD(f0). These two methods were applied to the city of Grenoble, where 60 buildings were studied. Fragility curves for slight damage were derived for the various masonry and reinforced concrete classes of buildings. A site-specific earthquake scenario, taking into account local site conditions, was considered, corresponding to an ML = 5.5 earthquake at a distance of 15km. The results show the benefits of using experimental models to reduce variability of the slight damage fragility curve. Moreover, by introducing the experimental modal model of the buildings, it is possible to improve seismic risk assessment at an overall scale (the city) or a local scale (the building) for the first damage grade (slight damage). This level of damage, of great interest for moderate seismic-prone regions, may contribute to the seismic loss assessment. © 2011 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

12666,"Building damage assessment using scenario based tsunami numerical analysis and fragility curves A combination of a deterministic approach and fragility analysis is applied to assess tsunami damage caused to buildings. The area selected to validate the model is Imwon Port in Korea. The deterministic approach includes numerical modeling of tsunami propagation in the East Sea following an earthquake on the western coast of Japan. The model is based on the linear shallow-water equations (LSWE) augmented with Boussinesq approximation to account for dispersion effects in wave propagation, and coastal wave run-up is modeled by non-linear shallow-water equations (NLSWE). The output from the deterministic model comprises inundation depth. The numerical output is used to perform fragility analysis for buildings vulnerable to flooding by tsunamis in the port area. Recently developed fragility curves-based on the ordinal regression method-are used for damage probability estimates. The extent of structural damage in the areas under a tsunami hazard is identified by the numerical modeling of tsunami features. Our numerical model offers high bathymetric resolution, which enables us to capture flow features at the individual structure level and results in improved estimation of damage probability. This approach can serve as a measure of assessing structure vulnerability for areas with little or no records of tsunami damage and provide planners with a better understanding of structure behavior when a tsunami strikes. © 2016 by the authors.

The study firstly identifies the variables expressing insurance data and those explaining them, together with their interrelationships. Damage variables may be expressed as either monetary-based or number of claims-based. Explaining variables may be subdivided into four categories: meteorological, geographic, demographic and property/building-based. Most of the common and under-researched combinations of these variables and their expression are discussed. Secondly, a comparative analysis is presented of current models, highlighting their differences and similarities. The study demonstrates that the scope and approach of the models varies in relation to scale, the coverage and period of incorporated insurance claims, and the methods used for model development and validation. Thirdly, the study proposes a generic and adaptable framework, constructed from an aggregation of information contained in relevant literature, to define a workflow for model development and future deployment.

12767,"Developed approach to determine the seismic vulnerability of reinforced concrete structures Several evaluation methods of the seismic vulnerability have been developed around the world. Which are very use ful from humanitarian and socioeconomic point of view. Generally these methods use knowledge obtained from previous earthquakes and they are basing on seismic intensity scales and on buildings direct observation. But the macroseismic intensity expresses the consequences of the seism, and not its physical characteristics of the structures. Contrary to this type of methods, an approach based on a nonlinear analysis (Push-Over method) is proposed in this work. It consists in modeling the excitation of the earthquake by a response spectrum and building's behavior by capacity curves. These capacity curves are obtained from numerical modeling performed by Opensees software. The superposition of the two curves, response spectra and capacity curve, makes it possible to determine the performance point and consequently to deduce the state of expected damage. To estimate the probability of damage of a building at a given level of solicitation (defined by Sd), we excites a group of buildings characterized by different parameters related to the geometry of the building and those are related to the materials used (concrete, steel) by seismic solicitation (Response spectrum - RPA 99). The performance point for each building is determined by a procedure defined in FEMA 440. We classifies the buildings according to the position of performance point on their curve which defines a damage state of ds (Mild, Moderate, Important or Ruin) according to the damage levels of Risk-UE. A statistical analysis is then made for each class to build the fragility curves. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.

The capacity spectrum method is adopted to determine the damage state of the target wharf structure. Fragility curves are assumed to be lognormal distribution with two parameters. The estimation of these two parameters is done by the maximum likelihood method. The uncertainty associated with the ground motion is simulated by analyzing the statistical characteristics of the records of ground motion collected near the site. In addition, the uncertainties associated with the capacity spectrum and the thresholds of different damage states are also analyzed.

Other characteristics of the flooding situation and of the flooded object are rarely taken into account, although flood damage is influenced by a variety of factors. We apply a group of data-mining techniques, known as tree-structured models, to flood damage assessment. A very comprehensive data set of more than 1000 records of direct building damage of private households in Germany is used. Each record contains details about a large variety of potential damage-influencing characteristics, such as hydrological and hydraulic aspects of the flooding situation, early warning and emergency measures undertaken, state of precaution of the household, building characteristics and socio-economic status of the household. Regression trees and bagging decision trees are used to select the more important damage-influencing variables and to derive multi-variate flood damage models. It is shown that these models outperform existing models, and that tree-structured models are a promising alternative to traditional damage models.

16878,"Development of Building Damage Functions for Big Earthquakes in Turkey The current work is an attempt to predict building reactions to big earthquakes using real data collected from surveys carried out after the occurrence of earthquakes. With the development of building damage functions for big earthquakes in Turkey one can predict the damage levels as a function of earthquakes’ intensity and the building parameters. Our model is based on neural networks techniques which allow for the non-linear correlations to be taken into account. We analyse data collected for damaged buildings after the following three big earthquakes: Afyon (2002; Mw = 6.0), Bingöl (2003; Mw = 6.4) and Düzce (1999; Mw = 7.2). The current model includes some of the main important factors affecting the health of any structure, namely, age, number of stories, floor areas, and the column areas. Our method of damage prediction is based on several earthquakes and buildings with different damage levels. The obtained results show that there is a strong correlation between the strength of the earthquake, the basic building parameters and the damage level. The obtained building damage function is essential for future plans and regulations for new constructions and can be considered as an essential module for hazards mitigation systems. earthquakes  estimation methods  neural networks  structural health monitoring None",Development of Building Damage Functions for Big Earthquakes in Turkey,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022071401139043857,0.10746415058942108,0.04887758728279376,0.24960946392008018,ML

A two-storey 1980s reinforced concrete building in the northern city of Constantine was studied using the proposed method as part of a vulnerability assessment and strengthening proposal. Fragility curves for the existing and strengthened structure were derived and log-normal cumulative distribution function parameters were obtained for the four defined damage states by considering maximum inter-storey drift ratio. Incremental dynamic analysis was then used to assess spectral acceleration by conducting 300 non-linear time-history analyses based on 15 ground motions. The records were then selected and scaled to fit with Algerian design response spectra, and fragility curves were subsequently developed.

18398,"Improving flood damage assessments in data-scarce areas by retrieval of building characteristics through UAV image segmentation and machine learning - A case study of the 2019 floods in southern Malawi Reliable information on building stock and its vulnerability is important for understanding societal exposure to floods. Unfortunately, developing countries have less access to and availability of this information. Therefore, calculations for flood damage assessments have to use the scarce information available, often aggregated on a national or district level. This study aims to improve current assessments of flood damage by extracting individual building characteristics and estimate damage based on the buildings' vulnerability. We carry out an object-based image analysis (OBIA) of high-resolution (11Äâ‚¬Â¯cm ground sample distance) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery to outline building footprints. We then use a support vector machine learning algorithm to classify the delineated buildings. We combine this information with local depth-damage curves to estimate the economic damage for three villages affected by the 2019 January river floods in the southern Shire Basin in Malawi and compare this to a conventional, pixel-based approach using aggregated land use to denote exposure. The flood extent is obtained from satellite imagery (Sentinel-1) and corresponding water depths determined by combining this with elevation data. The results show that OBIA results in building footprints much closer to OpenStreetMap data, in which the pixel-based approach tends to overestimate. Correspondingly, the estimated total damage from the OBIA is lower (EUR 10Äâ‚¬Â¯140) compared to the pixel-based approach (EUR 15Äâ‚¬Â¯782). A sensitivity analysis illustrates that uncertainty in the derived damage curves is larger than in the hazard or exposure data. This research highlights the potential for detailed and local damage assessments using UAV imagery to determine exposure and vulnerability in flood damage and risk assessments in data-poor regions.

15050,"A class-oriented large scale comparison with postearthquake damage for Abruzzi Region The need to quickly and accurately estimate the number of involved people, dead and the injured, missing people and homeless represent a topic issue in the emergency management and disaster planning. Obviously, such an estimation is closely related to the evaluation of building damage scenario for the area of interest. To this aim, it may be used different methodological approaches for the evaluation of seismic vulnerability at large-scale, consisting of empirical or mechanical methodologies, more or less simplified and that require a different level of detail in input parameters. In present work, a simplified mechanical method - PushOver on Shear Type models (POST) - for seismic vulnerability assessment of infilled RC building is briefly recalled [1,2,3]. The methodology allows the definition of building structural characteristic through a simulated design procedure in compliance with design code prescriptions, professional practice and seismic classification of the area of interest at the time of construction. The evaluation of non-linear static response is performed through a simplified model, considering the contribution of both RC columns and infill panels to lateral resistance, based on Shear Type assumption. Seismic capacity assessment is made in the SPO2IDA framework [4] for different performance levels, defined according to the damage classification proposed by [5]. Finally, the use of a Monte Carlo simulation approach allows the derivation of fragility curves for different damage states (DSs). Therefore, predicted damage scenario is derived from POST methodology for a database consisting of 7597Moment Resisting Frame (MRF) residential RC buildings located in the Abruzzi region, which after the 2009 catastrophic earthquake have been charged to post-earthquake usability assessment procedure [6]. Due to the use of spatially extended and massive amount of data, the reference unit is the class of building. The choice of key parameters for the identification of classes is carried out evaluating their impact on the observed damage collected through post-earthquake survey. Then, within each class, the remaining parameters are assumed as random variables chosen in appropriate distributions evaluated from data collected during the post-earthquake survey. Correlation values among the variable of each class are evaluated. Predicted damage scenario is then compared with damage scenario based on post-earthquake data. © 2017 National Technical University of Athens. All rights reserved.

15495,"An assessment of the effectiveness of tree-based models for multi-variate flood damage assessment in Australia Flood is a frequent natural hazard that has significant financial consequences for Australia. In Australia, physical losses caused by floods are commonly estimated by stage-damage functions. These methods usually consider only the depth of the water and the type of buildings at risk. However, flood damage is a complicated process, and it is dependent on a variety of factors which are rarely taken into account. This study explores the interaction, importance, and influence of water depth, flow velocity, water contamination, precautionary measures, emergency measures, flood experience, floor area, building value, building quality, and socioeconomic status. The study uses tree-based models (regression trees and bagging decision trees) and a dataset collected from 2012 to 2013 flood events in Queensland, which includes information on structural damages, impact parameters, and resistance variables. The tree-based approaches show water depth, floor area, precautionary measures, building value, and building quality to be important damage-influencing parameters. Furthermore, the performance of the tree-based models is validated and contrasted with the outcomes of a multi-parameter loss function (FLFArs) from Australia. The tree-based models are shown to be more accurate than the stage-damage function. Consequently, considering more parameters and taking advantage of tree-based models is recommended. The outcome is important for improving established Australian flood loss models and assisting decision-makers and insurance companies dealing with flood risk assessment. © 2016 by the authors.

19498,"Performance-Based Tsunami Engineering for Risk Assessment of Structures Subjected to Multi-Hazards: Tsunami following Earthquake Tsunamis are low-probability high-consequence events, usually caused by an earthquake in the ocean and can result in high casualty rates and billions of dollars in damage. Tsunamis can be divided into two main categories: near-field and far-field tsunamis, based on the location of their origin with respect to the site of interest. To perform risk assessment of communities subjected to tsunamis, the current approach would be to use empirical data from historical events, making the data site specific. Recently, researchers have developed approaches to estimate the risk of structures subjected to far-field earthquake generated tsunamis using a simulated tsunami force on a structure numerically. However, for near-field tsunamis, ground motions caused by the earthquake will reach the structure earlier than the tsunami, damaging the structure, which can substantially impair its structural performance in the following tsunami. The multi-hazard case of tsunami following earthquake is discussed herein and a physics-based approach to estimate the risk of structures subjected to them is presented. An illustrative example is presented to elaborate the methodology for a steel building. Successive nonlinear analyses are used to develop fragility functions based on joint earthquake-tsunami intensity measures (spectral acceleration-flow depth-flow velocity). These functions are used in combination with hazard analysis of a specific location to obtain loss estimates. Three different approaches were used for this process and the results showed that the use of the joint three intensity-measure fragilities is essential for the accuracy when estimating damage or structural loss and neglecting their interaction results in substantial errors.

18712,"Life-Cycle and Seismic Fragility Assessment of Code-Conforming Reinforced Concrete and Steel Structures in Bucharest, Romania In this article, the fragility of reinforced concrete and steel structures in Bucharest, a city of high seismic hazard, designed using the recent building codes in Romania, is assessed. A total of 24 reinforced concrete and steel structures with heights varying from five stories to 13 stories were analyzed. Their seismic fragility was evaluated using two procedures from the literature. In the first procedure (SPO2FRAG), the fragility was derived based on the pushover curves using the SPO2IDA algorithm, while in the second procedure (FRACAS), the fragility was derived from nonlinear time-history analyses. The analyzed structures were designed for three levels of peak ground accelerations, corresponding to mean return periods of 100, 225, and 475 years. Subsequently, the damage assessment of the analyzed structures was performed using ground motions generated from a Monte-Carlo simulated earthquake catalogue for the Vrancea intermediate-depth seismic source. The damage degrees that were estimated using the SPO2FRAG approach are higher than those estimated using the FRACAS approach. The life-cycle analysis of the structures shows that a further increase of the design peak ground acceleration for Bucharest is feasible from an economic point of view using the SPO2FRAG results. However, based on the FRACAS results, the opposite conclusion can be drawn. Finally, generic lognormal fragility functions are proposed as a function of building height and structural system. © 2018, The Author(s).

12972,"Fragility curves for non-engineered masonry buildings in developing countries derived from real data based on structural surveys and laboratory tests Malawi is located within the southern branch of the active East African Rift System, where earthquakes of moment magnitude (Mw) 7.0 or greater can occur along major faults. The majority of dwellings in the country are non-engineered unreinforced masonry constructions, built by local artisans with little input from engineers. These constructions are highly vulnerable to seismic events due to poor-quality materials and lack of construction detailing. This study presents a new methodology to assess the seismic fragility curves of typical dwellings located in the Central and Southern Malawi. On-site inspections of buildings are carried out to assess geometrical and structural features of 646 façades, and an experimental campaign is performed to characterise the mechanical properties of local construction materials. The collected data allow the identification of different building typologies in terms of quality of materials and construction techniques. The critical failure modes for each of the inspected façade at their ultimate limit state are evaluated analytically. Damage limit states are defined and adopted to derive simplified Static Push-Over (SPO) curves, transformed into incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) curves by using SPO2IDA. The IDA curves are then used to obtain fragility curves for the specific damage limit states. The fragility curves presented herein are the first to be calculated for these building typologies, based on local data, and unfortunately, they show that buildings in Malawi are far more vulnerable to earthquakes than estimated from previously available international reference data. The fragility curves developed in this study may prove useful for assessing the seismic risk of these building typologies in Malawi and other East African countries. © 2021, The Author(s).

Survey data were collected by the Italian Department of Civil Protection during post-earthquake usability inspections including information on building characteristics, level and extent of damage to structural and non-structural components. For each building, the Peak Ground Acceleration demand has been determined according to data available from the ShakeMap of the event and the georeferenced building location. The analysis of data highlights the key role played by the damage to non-structural components-namely, infills and partitions. Damage Grades according to the European Macroseismic Scale EMS-98 have been derived from damage data to single building components. Two building classes have been defined in the study in order to investigate the influence of number of storeys of buildings on the observed damage. Damage Probability Matrices have been derived for the assumed building classes and bins of Peak Ground Acceleration, and observed trends are analyzed. Different methodologies for estimating fragility functions from data on Damage Grades and Peak Ground Acceleration demand are illustrated, discussed and applied to the database, leading to the derivation of EMS-98-based fragility curves for the defined building classes. Finally, the proposed fragility curves are compared with main empirical fragility curves for RC buildings from literature studies.

21082,"Seismic Vulnerability Analysis of RC Buildings: Case Study of Ibn Khaldoun Area in Boumerdes City, Algeria This study focuses on empirical assessment of vulnerability and fragility curves of existing reinforced concrete (RC) buildings in Ibn Khaldoun area of Boumerdes city (Algeria). In this area, existing RC buildings experienced significant damage during the 2003 Boumerdes earthquake. Currently, the area includes existing non-damaged buildings, strengthened buildings and new RC buildings constructed in place of those demolished. The proposed seismic vulnerability assessment method combines the GNDT (Gruppo Nazionale per la Difesa dai Terremoti) II level method and the macroseismic method by means of correlation between the peak ground acceleration PGA and the macroseismic intensity I. For this purpose, data was collected by investigating buildings within the area. Structural and non-structural building characteristics were identified and statistical analysis was performed. Resulting vulnerability curves obtained using the macroseismic method were expressed as a function of macroseismic intensity and the vulnerability index obtained using the GNDT II level method. Fragility curves, obtained by using correlation between the peak ground acceleration PGA and the macroseismic intensity I, showed that the highest probability to reach or exceed a very heavy damage grade is obtained for the highest values of I and vulnerability index V.

16093,"Catchment-scale flood hazard mapping and flood vulnerability analysis of residential buildings: The case of Khando River in eastern Nepal Study region: This study considers the Khando River (a tributary of Koshi River) in eastern Nepal. Study focus: To quantify the hazard and vulnerabilities across one of the frequently flooding catchments, i.e. Khando River, we conducted flood hazard assessment for 20, 50, 100, and 200 years return periods. We coupled flood hazard analysis with vulnerability analysis of the most dominant construction system along the river channel, i.e. wattle and daub houses. Based on the measured inundation depths, we created vulnerability and fragility functions. The flood hazard maps, damage mechanisms due to the 2017 flood, and vulnerability, as well as fragility, curves are reported in this paper. New Hydrological Insights for the Region: The flood hazard analysis highlighted that the 2017 flood was equivalent to 20 years return period flood. Flood hazard analysis shows that the variation in the maximum inundation depth is not so wide between 20 and 200 years return periods for the Khando River catchment. Flood vulnerability analysis of residential houses along the riverbank highlighted that the wattle and daub construction system is highly vulnerable even for 20 years return period flood.

So far, damage caused by high groundwater levels has rarely been considered in flood risk analysis. However, reliable damage models are necessary to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of mitigation measures and to support a comprehensive risk management. Therefore, the ""Flood Loss Estimation Model for the private sector"" FLEMOps was further developed for modelling damage due to high groundwater levels. FLEMOps is empirically based and considers several damage influencing factors. In addition to the water depth, information on the building type as well as the level of precaution and contamination are also taken into account.

20629,"Seismic fragility assessment of high strength reinforced concrete columns considering parameter uncertainty Application of high performance materials in construction combines the advantages of reducing the use of materials, cross-section and reinforcement congestion. Although the application of high strength concrete (HSC) has been gaining popularity in high-rise building construction, parameters affecting the performance of HSC members are still under investigation. The use of high strength steel can result in reduced steel congestion and low cost associated with transportation and installation of rebars. Although many design codes and guidelines apply restrictions on the yield strength of steel reinforcement, high-strength steel (HSS) rebars are still a viable option for longitudinal reinforcement in columns of multi-story moment-frame buildings designed to resist earthquake motions. In this study, a numerical approach has been undertaken for the seismic fragility analysis of RC columns and frames with HSS and HSC. Fragility curves provide the flexibility to deal with the uncertainty in geometric properties, along with the typical uncertainties such as material and ground motion uncertainties. Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) technique is employed to quantify the uncertainties associated with different modeling parameters such as concrete compressive strength, yield strength of longitudinal and transverse reinforcement, gross geometries and ground motions. Probabilistic seismic demand model (PSDM) is used to develop fragility curves. The fragility curves thus developed quantify the vulnerability of high strength RC columns and frames and show their effectiveness in reducing the probability of failure compared to regular strength RC columns.

16157,"Classifying earthquake damage to buildings using machine learning The ability to rapidly assess the spatial distribution and severity of building damage is essential to post-event emergency response and recovery. Visually identifying and classifying individual building damage requires significant time and personnel resources and can last for months after the event. This article evaluates the feasibility of using machine learning techniques such as discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and random forests, to rapidly predict earthquake-induced building damage. Data from the 2014 South Napa earthquake are used for the study where building damage is classified based on the assigned Applied Technology Council (ATC)-20 tag (red, yellow, and green). Spectral acceleration at a period of 0.3 s, fault distance, and several building specific characteristics (e.g. age, floor area, presence of plan irregularity) are used as features or predictor variables for the machine learning models. A portion of the damage data from the Napa earthquake is used to obtain the forecast model, and the performance of each machine learning technique is evaluated using the remaining (test) data. It is noted that the random forest algorithm can accurately predict the assigned tags for 66% of the buildings in the test dataset. © The Author(s) 2020. 2014 South Napa earthquake  artificial intelligence  Earthquake damage assessment  machine learning Buildings  Decision trees  Discriminant analysis  Earthquakes  Machine learning  Nearest neighbor search  Random forests  Statistical tests  Earthquake damages  K-nearest neighbors  Machine learning models  Machine learning techniques  Personnel resources  Predictor variables  Random forest algorithm  Spectral acceleration  Forecasting  algorithm  artificial intelligence  building  earthquake damage  earthquake event  machine learning",Classifying earthquake damage to buildings using machine learning,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015382554123060837,0.03931439856525638,0.03449835734645934,0.937139674145563,ML
20291,"Seismic assessment of the XX century masonry buildings in Florence: Vulnerability insights based on urban data acquisition and nonlinear static analysis This paper deals with the seismic vulnerability assessment of modern masonry buildings in Florence, Italy. The work focuses on the XX century masonry structures realized before seismic codes. The research is divided into two main distinct phases: i) the acquisition of the main geometrical and structural information at the urban scale; ii) the selection of a representative model to execute an analytical assessment. The first part of the work represents a cognitive phase based on archive research and the collection of the buildings, which allowed the architectural and structural identification of over 300 structures. The second part of the work represents an analytical phase targeted at deriving fragility curves. A real case study representative of the simple block typology with two apartments per floor and a central stairwell has been selected and a probabilistic framework based on nonlinear static analysis has been performed. The analytical conclusions of the research point out a significant vulnerability of these structures, mainly ruled by a weak-piers-strong-spandrels behaviour. For the Life Safety limit state (SLV), around 40% of probability to having DL4 and 40% reaching DL5 are expected.

16107,"Challenges for bayesian network learning in a flood damage assessment application Learning Bayesian networks from real world data poses challenges of different kinds. In this paper we address the principled handling of continuous variables in the light of incomplete observations using the example of flood damage assessment. The described proceeding can easily be transferred to other domains. Avoiding assumptions on the distributional family, we discretize the continuous variables thus allowing for distribution-free learning.The problem is cast in a Bayesian framework: instead of discretizing as a pre-processing step to the Bayesian network learning,we consider the maximum aposteriori of the joint distribution of the random variables: network structure, parameters and discretization. The incomplete observations raise an additional problem on top. Statistics used for the Bayesian network learning and discretization of the variables depend on the missing values. Iterative proceedings for the missing value prediction are infeasible, since they nest additional iterations into the already iterative algorithm for discretization and Bayesian network learning. Instead we use the non-iterative Markov Blanket Predictor (Riggelsen 2006). This approach restricts attention to the Markov Blanket variables for which similar data records are used to derive several approximate predictive distributions. The flood damage assessment is based on a data set that involves 29 partly continuous variables and offers a unique opportunity for Bayesian network learning, taking not only the flooding parameters into account, but considering the warning situation, precautions, building characteristics and socio-economic factors as well. The resulting network shows, that the damage caused to a building by a flood event depends on a variety of factors. Especially flood and precaution parameters seem to have a crucial impact. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

12748,"Damage index fragility assessment of low-rise light-frame wood buildings under long duration subduction earthquakes This paper presents fragility curves for conventional low-rise light-frame wood buildings in southwestern British Columbia, Canada, for long duration subduction earthquakes. Computational models of four representative two-story houses (two engineered and two non-engineered) are developed and validated using full-scale shake table testing data. Damage states are evaluated using the Park and Ang damage index. Incremental dynamic analyses are employed for calibrating and assessing the index. Duration effects are investigated by using 30 long duration subduction motions and 30 “spectrally equivalent” short duration crustal motions. The results indicate that the considered houses are more vulnerable to damage under subduction motions which increase the median damage indices of both individual shearwalls and entire lateral systems for all four houses at the same level of ground shaking. The correlation between system damage indices with ground motion duration was dependent on the level of ground shaking and the seismic resistance of the systems. The results further demonstrate that exterior stucco finish greatly reduces the seismic damage and can be used as an effective seismic retrofit strategy for conventional non-engineered wood construction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Fragility curve  Ground motion duration  Incremental dynamic analyses  Structural damage  Subduction earthquake Building materials  Earthquake effects  Earthquake engineering  Houses  Structural analysis  Wooden buildings  Wooden construction  Fragility curves  Ground motions  Incremental dynamic analysis  Structural damages  Subduction earthquakes  Damage detection",Damage index fragility assessment of low-rise light-frame wood buildings under long duration subduction earthquakes,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,Analytical
19152,"Non-linear static procedures applied to high-rise residential URM buildings In this work, the vulnerability of an unreinforced masonry building, evaluated on the one hand by using the incremental dynamic analysis, and on the other hand by using nine representative non-linear static incremental procedures, is compared. For comparison reasons among the different non-linear static procedures, the obtained incremental dynamic analyses results are used as reference values. The aim of this analysis is to evaluate the applicability and reliability of the diverse non-linear static procedures for unreinforced masonry buildings, and to propose modifications oriented to improve their use in this typology of structures. For this purpose, a fully representative unreinforced masonry building of the dominating building type in the Eixample district of Barcelona, is analyzed. Furthermore, the conditional spectrum approach procedure has been applied with the aim to conveniently define the seismic demand. Regarding the definition of the fragility curves, two different methodologies were used for each non-linear static procedure and incremental dynamic analyzes. Subsequently, the corresponding damage indices as well as the damage curves were calculated and compared for the different considered peak ground acceleration values. The results of this comparison seem to confirm that the damage curves obtained by performing the NSP and by applying the Risk-UE methodology overestimate the damage corresponding to low values of the PGA and underestimate the damage for higher values of the PGA. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

A correlation graph has been constructed between peak ground acceleration (PGA) and, RVS, indicating different damage states of a building. Around 80% of RC buildings located in Zone V of Himachal Pradesh will suffer moderate damage and around 73% of RC buildings located in Zone IV will suffer slight damage in the event of earthquake with PGA prescribed as per IS 1893.

19833,"Progressive failure analysis of low-rise timber buildings under extreme wind events using a DAD approach This paper discusses the interaction of low-rise timber buildings with wind loads under significant wind events such as hurricanes. The proposed analysis methodology is capable of predicting the progressive failure of low-rise buildings as a result of the wind-structure interaction for a cost-effective design. It will also assist in evaluating the wind intensity from the observed damage state of buildings. Two deterministic finite-element (FE) models are developed using ANSYS for the full-scale numerical simulation. The first model with a simple building configuration is used for the validation of a numerical modeling methodology in the ultimate failure range. It also serves to validate the proposed progressive failure analysis process via the calibration from the corresponding wind tests that can simulate failures. Then, this analysis methodology is used to study the successive stages of damage on the second model to unveil its potential applications on a more representative residential buildings in U.S. Spatiotemporally varying wind loads are applied with the purpose of expanding the application of database-assisted design (DAD) approach from the linear range to the nonlinear range and finally to the stage-wise failures, which is a necessity of the vulnerability assessment and is critical for the damage and loss prediction for the insurance industry.

18877,"Microzonation of seismic risk in a low-rise Latin American city based on the macroseismic evaluation of the vulnerability of residential buildings: Colima city, México A macroseismic methodology of seismic risk microzonation in a low-rise city based on the vulnerability of residential buildings is proposed and applied to Colima city, Mexico. The seismic risk microzonation for Colima consists of two elements: the mapping of residential blocks according to their vulnerability level and the calculation of an expert-opinion based damage probability matrix (DPM) for a given level of earthquake intensity and a given type of residential block. A specified exposure time to the seismic risk for this zonation is equal to the interval between two destructive earthquakes. The damage probability matrices were calculated for three types of urban buildings and five types of residential blocks in Colima. It was shown that only 9% of 1409 residential blocks are able to resist to the Modify Mercalli (MM) intensity VII and VIII earthquakes without significant damage. The proposed DPM-2007 is in good accordance with the experimental damage curves based on the macroseismic evaluation of 3332 residential buildings in Colima that was carried out after the 21 January 2003 intensity MM VII earthquake. This methodology and the calculated PDM-2007 curves may be applied also to seismic risk microzonation for many low-rise cities in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. © 2010 Author(s).

12806,"Development of seismic fragility functions for a moment resisting reinforced concrete framed structure Understanding the seismic vulnerability of building structures is important for seismic engineers, building owners, risk insurers and governments. Seismic vulnerability defines a buildings predisposition to be damaged as a result of an earthquake of a given severity. There are two components to seismic risk; the seismic hazard and the exposure of the structural inventory to any given earthquake event. This paper demonstrates the development of fragility curves at different damage states using a detailed mechanical model of a moment resisting reinforced concrete structure typical of Southern Europe. The mechanical model consists of a complex three-dimensional finite element model of the reinforced concrete moment resisting frame structure and is used to define the damage states through pushover analysis. Fragility curves are also defined using the HAZUS macro-seismic methodology and the Risk-UE macro-seismic methodology. Comparison of the mechanically modelled and HAZUS fragility curve shows good agreement while the Risk-UE methodology shows reasonably poor agreement. © McCrum et al.; License Bentham Open.

21062,"Seismic Scenario of Algiers City: Case Study of Strengthened Masonry Buildings Strengthened masonry buildings are one of the most common types of old structure usually located in the ancient Algerian urban nuclei. The present study focused on common strengthened masonry buildings. Feedback from seismic experiments has shown that their dynamic behavior is generally nonlinear and highly vulnerable to earthquakes. Also, in order to predict the rate of damage that could occur to this type of structure in the event of earthquakes, empirical fragility curves based on a probabilistic method have been developed. In this study, seismic fragility analysis has been performed using the vulnerability index and the average damage rate. The vulnerability index will belong to one of three vulnerability classes determined by nonlinear dynamic analysis. The average damage is obtained using a deterministic method taking into account the vulnerability index and the seismic intensity. The fragility curves, which give the probability of achieving or exceeding a certain damage level for the three classes of vulnerability considered, have been compared to different studies that developed similar analyses.

15339,"A simplified approach for including the incidence angle effect in seismic risk assessment A simplified procedure is developed to consider the azimuthal orientation of buildings when estimating seismic risk. Two square-plan reinforced concrete building models are considered as a testbed, one with similar and one with dissimilar properties along the two principal horizontal axes. The fragility of both structures is analysed using a set of ground motion records rotated to multiple incidence angles to develop orientation-dependent fragility functions. It has been observed that, re-orienting all records so that these structures have the same azimuth vis-à-vis the corresponding epicentre leads to significant differences compared to assuming random orientations. Additional results stemming from single-degree-of-freedom oscillators further confirm such findings, showing a dependence to the proximity to the faults and the level of dissimilarity in the principal horizontal axes of the structure. The end results point to a non-negligible bias in assessment studies when a structure's orientation with respect to governing rupture scenarios is not taken into account. It is shown that the median of fragility curves calculated for un-rotated incidence angles can be bias-corrected through shifted by an amount that depends on the azimuthal orientation and level of axes-dissimilarity of structures. © 2021 The Authors.

15313,"A procedure for seismic risk assessment of Italian RC buildings This paper presents empirical fragility curves for the Italian residential reinforced concrete building stock, by taking advantage of post-earthquake damage data collected in the online platform Da.D.O., recently released by the Italian Department of Civil Protection. The peak ground acceleration from shakemap is selected to represent the ground motion severity at the building locations. Reinforced concrete buildings are classified into fifteen structural typologies, identified based on the number of stories (from 1 to 5) and the type of design (i.e. for gravity loads only, for seismic loads pre-1981 and for seismic loads post-1981). Typological fragility curves are derived for five damage states of the EMS-98, accounting for damage on both structural and non-structural building components. Two vulnerability classes, C2 and D, of decreasing vulnerability are defined, then refined based on the building class of height (i.e. low-rise, mid-rise and high-rise). Fragility curves of the predefined vulnerability classes are then obtained by averaging typological fragility functions, suitably weighted based on the composition of the existing building stock. The proposed fragility model is then implemented in the Italian National platform for large-scale seismic risk assessment. Copyright Â© 2019 COMPDYN Proceedings. All rights reserved.

15501,"An earthquake-source-based metric for seismic fragility analysis The seismic fragility of a system is the probability that the system enters a damage state under seismic ground motions with specified characteristics. Plots of the seismic fragilities with respect to scalar ground motion intensity measures are called fragility curves. Recent studies show that fragility curves may not be satisfactory measures for structural seismic performance, since scalar intensity measures cannot comprehensively characterize site seismicity. The limitations of traditional seismic intensity measures, e.g., peak ground acceleration or pseudo-spectral acceleration, are shown and discussed in detail. A bivariate vector with coordinates moment magnitude m and source-to-site distance r is proposed as an alternative seismic intensity measure. Implicitly, fragility surfaces in the (m, r)-space could be used as graphical representations of seismic fragility. Unlike fragility curves, which are functions of scalar intensity measures, fragility surfaces are characterized by two earthquake-hazard parameters, (m, r). The calculation of fragility surfaces may be computationally expensive for complex systems. Thus, as solutions to this issue, a bi-variate log-normal parametric model and an efficient calculation method, based on stochastic-reduced-order models, for fragility surfaces are proposed.

12523,"A Framework with reduced computational burden for Seismic Fragility Assessment of Reinforced Concrete Buildings in High-Intensity Seismic Zones The current research is targeted to develop the analytical fragility relationships of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings in high-intensity seismic zones by considering the effects of higher structural modes to reduce the computational effort. A new framework is presented in the study to assess the vulnerability in terms of the fragility relationships that can consider the modal response of individual modes in a building structure. The developed methodology considers the uncoupled modes of a structure employing a nonlinear single degree of freedom structures and defines distinct limit states for each mode separately. By using the presented methodology, the response of higher modes can be incorporated in the fragility assessment. For elucidation, a two-story reinforced concrete (RC) school building structure is selected from seismic zone 4 of Pakistan. In the first place, its vulnerability is assessed by developing fragility relationships using dynamic response history analysis of full three Dimensional nonlinear analytical models, subsequently, the fragility relationships are developed using the presented methodology by considering the first two modes of the structure. Afterward, a comparison has been made between the developed fragility curves from both of the methodologies. The results prove the effectiveness, swiftness, and the simplicity of the established methodology for carrying out the vulnerability assessments without compromising any accuracy.

18735,"Load-resistance analysis: an alternative approach to tsunami damage assessment applied to the 2011 Great East Japan tsunami Tsunami fragility functions describe the probability of structural damage due to tsunami flow characteristics. Fragility functions developed from past tsunami events (e.g., the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami) are often applied directly, without modification, to other areas at risk of tsunami for the purpose of damage and loss estimations. Consequentially, estimates carry uncertainty due to disparities in construction standards and coastal morphology between the specific region for which the fragility functions were originally derived and the region where they are being used. The main objective of this study is to provide an alternative approach to assessing tsunami damage, especially for buildings in regions where previously developed fragility functions do not exist. A damage assessment model is proposed in this study, where load-resistance analysis is performed for each building by evaluating hydrodynamic forces, buoyancies and debris impacts and comparing them to the resistance forces of each building. Numerical simulation was performed in this study to reproduce the 2011 Great East Japan tsunami in Ishinomaki, which is chosen as a study site. Flow depths and velocities were calculated for approximately 20 000 wooden buildings in Ishi-nomaki. Similarly, resistance forces (lateral and vertical) are estimated for each of these buildings. The buildings are then evaluated for their potential of collapsing. Results from this study reflect a higher accuracy in predicting building collapse when using the proposed load-resistance analysis, as compared to previously developed fragility functions in the same study area. Damage is also observed to have likely occurred before flow depth and velocity reach maximum values. With the above considerations, the proposed damage model might well be an alternative for building damage assessments in areas that have yet to be affected by modern tsunami events.

15157,"A hybrid approach for the seismic vulnerability assessment of the modern residential masonry buildings In this paper a hybrid approach for the seismic vulnerability assessment of the existing modern masonry buildings is developed. The procedure takes advantage of the standardized designs and technological features of the XX century masonry structures to define a hybrid framework constituted by two different phases: an urban scale one and one at the building level. The methodology is applied at the external outskirt of the city of Florence, where the residential stock is characterized by a significant number of masonry constructions. At the urban level a cognitive research based on archive research and data collection allowed the identification of the architectural and structural features of modern masonry buildings. Then, a selected case study representative of a wider class is chosen for a probabilistic procedure based on nonlinear static analysis and targeted at the derivation of fragility curves. The analytical results have been assumed to calibrate a simplified procedure available in literature and targeted at the definition of bilinear capacity curves. The calibration of the different coefficients was conducted in terms of generic outcomes, defining correlations within architectural elements and their seismic behavior (facades, side walls). The rapid methodology has been finally implemented at the urban scale, and the results of the work exhibit a relevant vulnerability of existing buildings.

20937,"Seismic resilience assessment of buildings: A simplified methodological approach through conventional seismic risk assessment A simplified methodology to evaluate seismic resilience of buildings through a probabilistic risk assessment is proposed. The methodology uses the results from the conventional seismic risk assessment with the inclusion of social and economic aspects. The seismic resilience assessment process considers the workforce population, repair time, direct and indirect losses. They can be applied within the damage definition stage with the aim of the vulnerability functions for a specific building typology, and loss estimation stage of the probabilistic risk assessment. For the case of the definition of vulnerability functions a previous methodological approach is used with fewer modifications. In addition, a new risk figure called average annual repair time is introduced in the probabilistic risk assessment allowing to obtain the resilience index. Aspects such as expected repair time, quantities of crew members, business interruption losses, workforce population capacity and risk figures: average annual loss, probable maximum loss and average annual repair time are considered. Then, all those aspects are integrated within the exposure, damage, and loss estimation models with additional considerations to perform the calculation of the resilience. Finally, the results are represented by means of a unitless simplified resilience index allowing to be compared among different scenarios. The methodology is illustrated using two study cases. The first one represented its application at damage definition stage and is comprised by 3-, 6- and 9-story reinforced concrete moment resisting frame school buildings designed for special seismic code level. The second one covered the application at loss estimation stage and considers a fictitious portfolio of approximately 190,000 buildings composed by the previous three building typologies located along the whole country of Peru.

16134,"Characteristics of building fragility curves for seismic and non-seismic tsunamis: case studies of the 2018 Sunda Strait, 2018 Sulawesi-Palu, and 2004 Indian Ocean tsunamis Indonesia has experienced several tsunamis triggered by seismic and non-seismic (i.e., landslides) sources. These events damaged or destroyed coastal buildings and infrastructure and caused considerable loss of life. Based on the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) guidelines, this study assesses the empirical tsunami fragility to the buildings inventory of the 2018 Sunda Strait, 2018 Sulawesi-Palu, and 2004 Indian Ocean (Khao Lak-Phuket, Thailand) tsunamis. Fragility curves represent the impact of tsunami characteristics on structural components and express the likelihood of a structure reaching or exceeding a damage state in response to a tsunami intensity measure. The Sunda Strait and Sulawesi-Palu tsunamis are uncommon events still poorly understood compared to the Indian Ocean tsunami (IOT), and their post-tsunami databases include only flow depth values. Using the TUNAMI two-layer model, we thus reproduce the flow depth, the flow velocity, and the hydrodynamic force of these two tsunamis for the first time. The flow depth is found to be the best descriptor of tsunami damage for both events. Accordingly, the building fragility curves for complete damage reveal that (i) in Khao Lak-Phuket, the buildings affected by the IOT sustained more damage than the Sunda Strait tsunami, characterized by shorter wave periods, and (ii) the buildings performed better in Khao Lak-Phuket than in Banda Aceh (Indonesia). Although the IOT affected both locations, ground motions were recorded in the city of Banda Aceh, and buildings could have been seismically dam- aged prior to the tsunami's arrival, and (iii) the buildings of Palu City exposed to the Sulawesi-Palu tsunami were more susceptible to complete damage than the ones affected by the JOT, in Banda Aceh, between 0 and 2 m flow depth. Similar to the Banda Aceh case, the Sulawesi-Palu tsunami load may not be the only cause of structural destruction. The buildings' susceptibility to tsunami damage in the waterfront of Palu City could have been enhanced by liquefaction events triggered by the 2018 Sulawesi earthquake.

16366,"Contribution of insurance data to cost assessment of coastal flood damage to residential buildings: insights gained from Johanna (2008) and Xynthia (2010) storm events There are a number of methodological issues involved in assessing damage caused by natural hazards. The first is the lack of data, due to the rarity of events and the widely different circumstances in which they occur. Thus, historical data, albeit scarce, should not be neglected when seeking to build ex-ante risk management models. This article analyses the input of insurance data for two recent severe coastal storm events, to examine what causal relationships may exist between hazard characteristics and the level of damage incurred by residential buildings. To do so, data was collected at two levels: from lists of about 4000 damage records, 358 loss adjustment reports were consulted, constituting a detailed damage database. The results show that for flooded residential buildings, over 75 % of reconstruction costs are associated with interior elements, with damage to structural components remaining very localised and negligible. Further analysis revealed a high scatter between costs and water depth, suggesting that uncertainty remains high in drawing up damage functions with insurance data alone. Due to the paper format of the loss adjustment reports, and the lack of harmonisation between their contents, the collection stage called for a considerable amount of work. For future events, establishing a standardised process for archiving damage information could significantly contribute to the production of such empirical damage functions. Nevertheless, complementary sources of data on hazards and asset vulnerability parameters will definitely still be necessary for damage modelling; multivariate approaches, crossing insurance data with external material, should also be investigated more deeply.

Three models of buildings representatives of the Eixample district of Barcelona have been chosen. The seismic vulnerability is evaluated by means of the Risk-UE methodology. The seismic demand is described by elastic project spectrum, in this case, defined by the Eurocode 8. Fragility curves are obtained from a nonlinear analysis, considering the capacity spectra. Expected seismic damage is gotten with the damage probability matrices, which indicate the occurrence probability of a damage state for a seismic demand given. The analysis of the buildings has been performed by TreMuri program by means of a macroelements model, which represents of a whole masonry panel. The buildings, here, analyzed are real and detailed structural drawings and reports have been used to model them.

The 1989 Newcastle and the 2010 Kalgoorlie earthquakes are the most recent Australian earthquakes to cause significant damage to unreinforced masonry (URM) and light timber frame structures and have provided the best opportunities to examine the earthquake vulnerability of these building types. This paper describes the two above-mentioned building types with a differentiation of older legacy buildings constructed prior to 1945 to the relatively newer ones constructed after 1945. Furthermore, the paper presents method to utilise the large damage and loss-related data (14,000 insurance claims in Newcastle and 400 surveyed buildings in Kalgoorlie) collected from these events to develop empirical vulnerability functions. The method adopted here followed the GEM empirical vulnerability assessment guidelines which involve preparing a loss database, selecting an appropriate intensity measure, selecting and applying a suitable statistical approach to develop vulnerability functions and the identification of optimum functions. The adopted method uses a rigorous statistical approach to quantify uncertainty in vulnerability functions and provides an optimum solution based on goodness-of-fit tests. The analysis shows that the URM structures built before 1945 are the most vulnerable to earthquake with post-1945 URM structures being the next most vulnerable. Timber structures appear to be the least vulnerable, with little difference observed in the vulnerability of timber buildings built before or after 1945. Moreover, the older structures (both URM and timber) exhibit more scatter in results reflecting greater variation in building vulnerability and performance during earthquakes. The analysis also highlights the importance of collecting high-quality damage and loss data which is not only a fundamental requirement for developing empirical vulnerability functions, but is also useful in validating analytically derived vulnerability functions. The vulnerability functions developed herein are the first publically available functions for Australian URM and timber structures. They can be used for seismic risk assessment and to focus the development of retrofit strategies to reduce the existing earthquake risk.

22002,"TSUNAMI HAZARD AND BUILDING DAMAGE ASSESSMENT IN THAILAND USING NUMERICAL MODEL AND FRAGILITY CURVES Assessing the hazard and damage of a potential tsunami is an ongoing challenge in tsunami research. This study begins by simulating tsunami hazards using historical events. A tsunami propagation model is used to obtain the estimated maximum tsunami height along the west coast of Thailand for a rough return period, and rupture locations that have the potential to generate catastrophic tsunamis in Thailand for a specific return period are proposed. A tsunami inundation model is then performed to quantify each building's maximum inundation depth, using high-resolution satellite images to extract each building's location for the areas of interest located in southern Thailand. Nam Khem village and Patong beach are selected as study areas to represent village communities and tourist attractions, respectively. The model results are then used to obtain the numbers of exposed inhabitants and buildings for each earthquake return period. The developed tsunami fragility curves are applied to these figures to determine the number of potentially damaged buildings. The analysis suggests that the propagation model can be used to obtain rough estimations because it provided results similar to those of the inundation model. However, material type must be considered when fragility curves are used in a different country (i.e. reinforced concrete buildings in Thailand from the 2004 tsunami and wooden houses in Japan from the 2011 East Japan tsunami).

17473,"Evaluating the effect of flood damage-reducing measures: A case study of the unembanked area of Rotterdam, the Netherlands Empirical evidence of increasing flood damages and the prospect of climatic change has initiated discussions in the flood management community on how to effectively manage flood risks. In the Netherlands, the framework of multi-layer safety (MLS) has been introduced to support this risk-based approach. The MLS framework consists of three layers: (i) prevention, (ii) spatial planning and (iii) evacuation. This paper presents a methodology to evaluate measures in the second layer, such as wet proofing, dry proofing or elevating buildings. The methodology uses detailed land-use data for the area around the city of Rotterdam (up to building level) that has recently become available. The vulnerability of these detailed land-use classes to flooding is assessed using the stage-damage curves from different international models. The methodology is demonstrated using a case study in the unembanked area of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, as measures from the second layer may be particularly effective there. The results show that the flood risk in the region is considerable: EUR 36 million p.a. A large part (almost 60 %) of this risk results from industrial land use, emphasising the need to give this category more attention in flood risk assessments. It was found that building level measures could substantially reduce flood risks in the region because of the relatively low inundation levels of buildings. Risk to residential buildings would be reduced by 40 % if all buildings would be wet-proofed, by 89 % if all buildings would be dry-proofed and elevating buildings over 100 cm would render the risk almost zero. While climate change could double the risk in 2100, such building level measures could easily nullify this effect. Despite the high potential of such measures, actual implementation is still limited. This is partly caused by the lack of knowledge regarding these measures by most Dutch companies and the legal impossibility for municipalities to enforce most of these measures as they would go beyond the building codes established at the national level. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

17908,"Fragility analysis of concrete building structures A simplified fragility analysis of concrete building frames is presented which can be easily adopted in practice. For the fragility analysis, a band limited white noise is taken as inputs to the bedrock level. The corresponding free field response spectrums are used for obtaining the seismic forces on the frame. In obtaining the free field response spectrum the effect of the soil layer is duly taken into consideration by considering both linear and nonlinear properties of the soil. An equivalent lateral load analysis is performed to find out the seismic response of the structure at various sections. The probability of failure at a section is obtained by using plastic analysis and the first order second moment theory of reliability taking into account the rotation capacity of the joints of the structure. For determining the probability of failure, the uncertainties included in the study are those of modeling of the system, inelastic action, concentration of hinges, earthquake input, base flexibility etc. The sensitivity of the probability of failure to the variation of some important parameters is conducted through a numerical study on a nine storey building frame. Results of the study indicate that the time period of the structure, the soil properties and the rotational capacity of the joints have considerable influence on the probability of failure of the building frame. © 2010 CAFET-INNOVA TECHNICAL SOCIETY.

18653,"Isointensity-isoexposure concept for seismic vulnerability analysis - A case study of the 1999 Chi-Chi, Taiwan earthquake Fragility curves can be developed using analytical or empirical methods. When the actual building damage records and the associated ground motion data are available, empirical methods are often adopted. Traditionally, district-based records of building damage are analyzed for developing such fragility curves. In this paper, a new procedure based on the concept of "". isointensity-isoexposure"" is developed. The new procedure is demonstrated through a case study of the building damage records collected from the 1999 Chi-Chi, Taiwan earthquake. The results show that the fragility curves developed with the proposed procedure are more in-line with observations than with the traditional district-based procedure. The developed fragility model may be used for earthquake loss estimation and future emergency planning in the study area. The limitations of the proposed approach include: (1) the developed fragility curves are area-specific and may not be readily applicable to other regions, and (2) ground motion intensity data may not be available at every location in an area of interest. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

15587,"Analysis of damage data of low-rise buildings subjected to a shallow Mw6.3 earthquake In May 2008 a shallow Mw6.3 earthquake struck South Iceland with an epicentre close to two small towns. Nearly 5000 low-rise residential buildings were affected. The recorded maximum PGA was 0.88g. A great deal of damage occurred, but there was no loss of life. In Iceland all buildings are registered in a detailed official database and insurance against natural disasters is obligatory. As the repair costs for every affected building had to be assessed for insurance purposes this provided an unusual opportunity to review structural performance across the whole population of buildings in the affected area. The estimated repair cost was classified in a number of subcategories covering structural and non-structural damage for five different residential building typologies. Study of these buildings showed that non-structural damage dominated the overall damage. The main monetary damage was cosmetic damage of partition walls and flooring. The structural systems performed quite well and no buildings collapsed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

15185,"A methodology for deriving analytical fragility curves for masonry buildings based on stochastic nonlinear analyses A new analytical approach for the derivation of fragility curves for masonry buildings is proposed. The methodology is based on nonlinear stochastic analyses of building prototypes. Since such structures are assumed to be representative of wider typologies, the mechanical properties of the prototypes are considered as random variables, assumed to vary within appropriate ranges of values. Monte Carlo simulations are then used to generate input variables from the probability density functions of mechanical parameters. The model is defined and nonlinear analyses are performed. In particular, nonlinear static (pushover) analyses are used to define the probability distributions of each damage state whilst nonlinear dynamic analyses allow to determine the probability density function of the displacement demand corresponding to different levels of ground motion. Convolution of the complementary cumulative distribution of demand and the probability density function of each damage state allows to derive fragility curves. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

15789,"Assessment of seismic fragility curves for existing RC buildings in Algiers after the 2003 Boumerdes earthquake The main purpose of this paper is to develop seismic fragility curves for existing reinforced concrete, RC, buildings based on the post earthquake field survey and the seismic performance using capacity design. Existing RC buildings constitute approximately 65% of the total stock in Algiers. This type of buildings, RC, was widely used in the past and chosen as the structural type for the future construction program of more than 2 millions apartments all over Algeria. These buildings, suffered moderate to extensive damage after the 2003 Boumerdes earthquake, on May 21st. The determination of analytical seismic fragility curves for low-rise and mid-rise existing RC buildings was carried out based on the consistent and complete post earthquake survey after that event. The information on the damaged existing RC buildings was investigated and evaluated by experts. Thirty four (34) communes (districts) of fifty seven (57), the most populated and affected by earthquake damage were considered in this study. Utilizing the field observed damage data and the Japanese Seismic Index Methodology, based on the capacity design method. Seismic fragility curves were developed for those buildings with a large number data in order to get a statistically significant sample size. According to the construction period and the code design, four types of existing RC buildings were considered.

18103,"Framework for Incorporating Probabilistic Building Performance in the Assessment of Community Seismic Resilience A framework is presented for incorporating probabilistic building performance limit states in the assessment of community resilience to earthquakes. The limit states are defined on the basis of their implications to postearthquake functionality and recovery. They include damage triggering inspection, occupiable damage with loss of functionality, unoccupiable damage, irreparable damage, and collapse. Fragility curves are developed linking earthquake ground motion intensity to the probability of exceedance for each of the limit states. A characteristic recovery path is defined for each limit state on the basis of discrete functioning states, the time spent within each state, and the level of functionality associated with each state. A building recovery function is computed accounting for the uncertainty in the occurrence of each recovery path and its associated limit state. The outcome is a probabilistic assessment of recovery of functionality at the building level for a given ground motion intensity. The effects of externalities and other socioeconomic factors on building-level recovery and ways to incorporate these in the framework are discussed. A case study is presented to demonstrate the application of the proposed framework to model the postearthquake recovery of the shelter-in-place housing capacity of an inventory of residential buildings.

18773,"Machine learning-based seismic fragility analysis of large-scale steel buckling restrained brace frames Steel frames equipped with buckling restrained braces (BRBs) have been increasingly applied in earthquake-prone areas given their excellent capacity for resisting lateral forces. Therefore, special attention has been paid to the seismic risk assessment (SRA) of such structures, e.g., seismic fragility analysis. Conventional approaches, e.g., nonlinear finite element simulation (NFES), are computationally inefficient for SRA analysis particularly for large-scale steel BRB frame structures. In this study, a machine learning (ML)based seismic fragility analysis framework is established to effectively assess the risk to structures under seismic loading conditions. An optimal artificial neural network model can be trained using calculated damage and intensity measures, a technique which will be used to compute the fragility curves of a steel BRB frame instead of employing NFES. Numerical results show that a highly efficient instantaneous failure probability assessment can be made with the proposed framework for realistic large-scale building structures.

19747,"Probabilistic mechanics-based loss scenarios for school buildings in Basel (Switzerland) Developing earthquake scenarios for cities in areas with a moderate seismicity is a challenge due to the limited amount of available data, which is a source of large uncertainties. This concerns both the seismic hazard, for which only recordings for small earthquakes are available and the unknown earthquake resistance of the majority of structures not designed for seismic loading. The goal of the present study is to develop coherent probabilistic mechanics-based scenarios for a mid-size building stock including a comprehensive analysis of the uncertainties. As an application, a loss assessment for the school buildings of the city of Basel is performed for different scenarios of historical significance, such as the 1356 event, and from the deaggregation of the Swiss Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Model of 2015. The hazard part of the computations (i.e. ground motion estimation) is based on this model, a regional microzonation and recordings of small earthquakes on a dense strong motion network to compute site-amplification factors. The school buildings, which are mainly unreinforced masonry or reinforced concrete shear wall buildings, have been classified according to a specifically developed taxonomy. Fragility curves have been developed using non-linear static procedures and subsequently, vulnerability curves in terms of human and financial losses are proposed. The computations have been run with the OpenQuake engine, carefully propagating all the recognized uncertainties. Scenarios before and after retrofitting measures show their impact on the earthquake safety. A sensitivity analysis shows that the largest uncertainties come from the ground motion prediction although an improvement of all parts of the model is necessary to decrease the uncertainties. Although improved data and models are still necessary to be developed, probabilistic mechanics-based models outperform the capabilities of deterministic and/or empirical models for retrieving realistic earthquake loss distributions. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Following a description of the FRACAS approach, the paper compares the predicted maximum interstory drift (MIDR) response obtained from FRACAS and nonlinear time history analyses (NLTHA) for two case-study buildings subjected to 150 natural accelerograms. FRACAS is seen to represent well the response of both case-study structures when compared to NLTHA.

20074,"Repair costs of reinforced concrete building components: from actual data analysis to calibrated consequence functions Modern seismic design and the retrofitting of buildings necessarily need to account for expected economic losses. Available refined and simplified procedures implemented in automatic computer tools allow for probabilistic loss assessments. These mostly rely on consequence functions derived by simulating the repair actions needed to restore a component to its pre-earthquake condition. However, due to the lack of data, only a few studies have benchmarked theoretical loss assessments with actual repair costs monitored in the aftermath of earthquake events. This paper analyses the actual repair costs of a database of 120 reinforced concrete residential buildings damaged by the 2009 earthquake in L'Aquila, Italy. The repair cost distributions and the correlation with observed earthquake damage are provided at the building and component levels.

16322,"Computational analysis of three dimensional steel frame structures through different stiffening members Ground motion records are commonly used for fragility curves (FCs) developing utilized in seismic loss estimating analysis for earthquake prone zones. These records could be 'real', say the recorded acceleration time series or 'simulated' records consistent with the regional seismicity and produced by use of alternative simulation methods. This study has focused on fragility curves developing for masonry buildings through computational 'simulated' ground motion records while evaluating the properness of these fragilities compared to the curves generated by the use of 'real' records. Assessing the dynamic responses of structures, nonlinear computational time history analyses through the equivalent single degree of freedom systems have been implemented on OpenSees platform.

16939,"Development of seismic hazard compatible vulnerability functions for stone masonry buildings In an effort to contribute to the reduction of seismic risk, the Geological Survey of Canada has recently undertaken a comprehensive quantitative risk assessment study. The proposed framework for rapid risk assessment considers region-specific inventory of the exposure, definition of the seismic hazard and assigning respective vulnerability. Structural vulnerability is the key component and is derived from vulnerability functions relating the intensity of the seismic motion to the expected damage for a given building type. This paper focuses on the development of analytical seismic vulnerability functions which reflect the characteristics of existing stone masonry buildings in Eastern Canada. The old historic center of Quebec City was selected as a study area due to the concentration of stone masonry buildings and their high heritage value. The procedure is a subsequent step of previous work on stone masonry buildings that developed the two main inputs for the vulnerability analysis: (1) capacity curves that characterize the nonlinear behavior of the existing stone masonry buildings and (2) displacement based fragility curves that represent the probability of exceedance of specified damage state under various levels of structural response. These two inputs are convolved with response spectra to estimate the structural damage to buildings for a series of earthquake magnitude-distance combinations. A set of vulnerability functions was developed for a rapid risk assessment in terms of mean damage factor. The vulnerability functions are particularly useful for regional seismic risk assessment studies as the computation time is significantly reduced. Among the considered earthquake scenarios, the most damaging was M7R20 scenario, which generated average MDF of 28% and 18% of red-tagged buildings, i.e., complete damage.

18069,"Fragility functions for local failure mechanisms in unreinforced masonry buildings: a typological study in Ferrara, Italy Unreinforced masonry buildings undergoing seismic actions often exhibit local failure mechanisms which represent a serious life-safety hazard, as recent strong earthquakes have shown. Compared to new buildings, older unreinforced masonry buildings are more vulnerable, not only because they have been designed without or with limited seismic loading requirements, but also because horizontal structures and connections amid the walls are not always effective. Also, Out-Of-Plane (OOP) mechanisms can be caused by significant slenderness of the walls even if connections are effective. The purpose of this paper is to derive typological fragility functions for unreinforced masonry walls considering OOP local failure mechanisms. In the case of slender walls with good material properties, the OOP response can be modeled with reference to an assembly of rigid bodies undergoing rocking motion. In particular, depending on its configuration, a wall is assumed either as a single rigid body undergoing simple one-sided rocking or a system of two coupled rigid bodies rocking along their common edge. A set of 44 ground motions from earthquake events occurred from 1972 to 2017 in Italy is used in this study. The likelihood of collapse is calculated via Multiple Stripe Analysis (MSA) from a given wall undergoing a specific ground motion. Then, the single fragility functions are suitably combined to define a typological fragility function for a class of buildings. The procedure is applied to a historical aggregate in the city center of Ferrara (Italy) as a case study. The fragility functions developed in this research can be a helpful tool for assessing seismic damage and economic losses in unreinforced masonry buildings on a regional scale.

22105,"Urban seismic scenario-based risk analysis using empirical fragility curves for Kerend-e-gharb after Mw 7.3, 2017 Iran earthquake This study provides the seismic scenario-based risk map of the small mountain city of Kerend-e-gharb. It evaluates the existing methods and formulations for the effects of a devastating earthquake using empirical fragility curves. A seismic vulnerability map is developed at the urban block-scale using a Geographic Information System for a variety of steel, reinforced concrete, confined masonry, unreinforced masonry, and adobe residential buildings. The estimated seismic damages are validated by comparing them with the building damages surveyed after the Sarpol-e-zahab earthquake. Moreover, the damages to the population, including the probability of homelessness, death, severe injuries that need immediate hospital treatment, moderate injuries that require hospital treatment, and light injuries, without hospitalization, are assessed. The estimation of debris, and the economic losses deriving from this natural hazard, are also investigated. Finally, the map of the mean damage index is presented. The mean damage index is reduced by the renovation and retrofitting interventions in high damaged buildings, while this index is increased in moderately damaged buildings that are not structurally upgraded. The results of this study are consistent with the earthquake damage distribution. In addition, and even with the reduction in vulnerability of buildings after seismic interventions, some blocks of the northeastern part of the city are still at high seismic risk. The results of this study can be used in seismic crisis management planning to achieve a sustainable city. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

17122,"Earthquake risk assessment for the building inventory of Muscat, Sultanate of Oman Earthquake risk can be quantified in terms of the estimated numbers of human casualties and of damaged buildings as well as the monetary losses. The information required for the assessment of earthquake risk in a given region includes the expected level of ground shaking intensity (i.e., the seismic hazard), inventory data for building stock at risk, identification of predominant building typologies and of their vulnerability characteristics, and spatial distribution of number of inhabitants. This study presents an indicative assessment of earthquake risk associated with the building stock in Muscat, the capital city of the Sultanate of Oman. For this purpose, building inventory and demographic data for the city are compiled in GIS environment. The buildings are classified to identify their damageability/vulnerability characteristics, and predominant building typologies are determined. For the estimation of casualties, Muscat population data are further analyzed to calculate number of occupants in the exposed building stock. Spectral acceleration–displacement based damage estimation methodology is implemented for risk calculations. Site-specific ground motions in terms spectral accelerations obtained from the probabilistic seismic hazard assessment for 475- and 2475-year return periods are considered for the representation of earthquake demand in damage analyses. Assessment of damage to buildings and estimation of casualties are obtained using analytical fragility relationships and building damage related casualty–vulnerability models, respectively.

17367,"Energy damage index based on capacity and response spectra Non-linear dynamic analysis and the damage index of Park-Ang have been often used to assess expected seismic damage to a structure. Depending on the size of the structure and the duration of the record, the computational effort in dynamic analyses is usually high. In this research, a new damage index is proposed based on nonlinear static analysis. The damage index is a linear combination of two energy functions: (1) the strain energy associated with the stiffness variation and the ductility of the structure, and (2) the dissipated energy associated with hysteretic cycles. These two energy functions are obtained from the capacity curve of the structure and from the energy balance with the spectral acceleration. To show the ability of the index to represent damage, low-rise steel buildings were studied under the seismic actions that are expected in Mexico City. The results obtained with the new method show good agreement with those calculated by means of dynamic analyses using the Park-Ang damage index. On average, the Park-Ang damage index is well-fitted by the combination of 62% of the strain energy and 38% of the energy dissipated by hysteresis. Moreover, the new damage index can link damage to certain characteristics of seismic actions, such as their intensity and duration. Therefore, the new approach results in a practical, powerful tool for estimating seismic damage in buildings, especially as probabilistic approaches require massive computations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd Capacity curve  Damage assessment  Energy dissipated by hysteresis  Monte Carlo simulations  Strain energy Dynamic analysis  Energy dissipation  Hysteresis  Intelligent systems  Monte Carlo methods  Seismic prospecting  Seismology  Stiffness  Strain energy  Structural analysis  Capacity curves  Computational effort  Damage assessments  Non-linear dynamic analysis  Non-linear static analysis  Probabilistic approaches  Spectral acceleration  Stiffness variations  Damage detection  damage  dynamic analysis  energy dissipation  hysteresis  index method  Monte Carlo analysis  seismic response  strain  structural response  Federal District [Mexico]  Mexico City  Mexico [North America]",Energy damage index based on capacity and response spectra,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3845902025762846,0.018798076900522022,0.19350965458604116,0.02378296149290438,Analytical
16294,"Comparison of PSH results with historical macroseismic observations at different scales. Part 1: methodology The need for verifying and/or validating the results of probabilistic seismic hazard studies has become evident, despite the absence of generally accepted methods for judging such results. This paper proposes a methodology for comparing the results of PSH with historical macroseismic observations, at different scale levels. The selected metric of the comparison is the mean damage, i.e. the average annually expected damage. Hence, a procedure for converting macroseismic observations and PGA levels, for which PSH estimates are provided, into mean damage values is first presented. The procedure is based on the macroseismic method for converting intensities into mean damage values, whereas it takes advantage of fragility curves (representative of the seismic vulnerability of the building stock at the time of historical observations) to transform the rates of occurrence of PGA values into the equivalent quantity in terms of mean damage. A methodology for site-specific comparison is first outlined. To overcome some of the limitations of the comparison at a single site, two procedures for aggregating several sites by sampling in space are then presented, with the aim of enlarging the available macroseismic dataset. Finally, a procedure for the comparison at the regional level is discussed.

18933,"Modelling correlated damage of spatially distributed building portfolios under scenario tropical cyclones Probabilistic damage assessment of a community under a scenario tropical cyclone needs to consider the collective damage of individual structures within the community. This involves modelling the spatial correlations of wind speeds and structural vulnerability between individual structures. Ignoring the spatial correlations can lead to unconservative assessment. However, the methods to model these two spatial correlations and their effects on damage assessment are limited. In this paper, a general probabilistic framework is proposed to analyze the correlated damage of spatially distributed building portfolios using joint fragility functions. Two cases are investigated: (1) the correlation of fragility functions of different buildings is given, and (2) the correlation of structural resistance is given from which the correlation of fragilities is computed. To demonstrate the framework, an example is provided to analyze the roof sheathing damage of a residential building portfolio under a cyclone event. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Community resilience  Cyclone  Hurricane  Natural hazards  Probabilistic risk assessment  Structural reliability Hurricanes  Spatial distribution  Storms  Tropics  Damage assessments  Individual structures  Probabilistic damage  Probabilistic framework  Residential building  Spatial correlations  Structural resistance  Structural vulnerability  Damage detection",Modelling correlated damage of spatially distributed building portfolios under scenario tropical cyclones,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15976348296192242,0.03197285178739303,0.40530961481391387,0.012494853830402953,Hybrid
12878,"Empirical seismic vulnerability analysis for masonry buildings based on school buildings survey in Iran School facilities in Iran, in particular masonry schools, have shown poor performance during past earthquakes and can be identified as one of the parts of the country’s infrastructure that is most vulnerable to earthquakes. Hence, in this paper a method to perform index-based damage assessment for brick masonry schools located in the province of Yazd, the central region of Iran, using a comprehensive database of school buildings, is proposed. The database was obtained from the field survey forms applied for each observed school to collect the features of and damage to the structure. The results of a vulnerability index method developed in Iran are employed as input data to obtain empirical fragility curves for the school inventory. The Macroseismic model and GNDT II level method are two empirical methods combined in this procedure.

16068,"Calibration of vulnerability and fragility curves from moderate intensity Italian earthquake damage data The objective of this work consists in the calibration of vulnerability and fragility curves for the main masonry building classes detected in Lunigiana and Garfagnana (north-west of Tuscany, Italy). The large-scale procedure aims at providing damage and unusability scenarios starting from a seismic hazard map and a typological/structural characterisation of the building stocks lying in the different sub-municipal homogeneous areas. The damage and vulnerability data collected in more than 3000 AeDES survey forms of rapid damage assessment, filled out in Lunigiana and Garfagnana after the June 21, 2013 Earthquake, along with the information derived from a fast visual screening of the facilities, have been processed to develop a specific database in a Geographical Information System (GIS) environment. The latter and the shakemaps downloaded from the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology have allowed to compare the actual fragility of the building sample with the expected one, which has been evaluated according to the Macroseismic Method. The study concludes with a conservative proposal of modification for the vulnerability and fragility curves, for low values of EMS-98 macroseismic intensity (IV-VI) or PGA (0.04 g–0.30 g), and the identification of empirical correlations between the percentage of unusable buildings and the EMS-98 damage levels or the shaking parameters. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd AeDES form  Building typology  Database  Fragility curves  Seismic vulnerability None",Calibration of vulnerability and fragility curves from moderate intensity Italian earthquake damage data,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04186606914576927,0.2655080134569542,0.06150584808079016,0.009458950686970984,Empirical

Inventory and damage information for more than 10,000 buildings was registered in survey data compiled by CISMID at Peru's National University of Engineering. The soil classes in the Pisco district were classified into three zones based on the predominant periods of microtremors at 85 sites, and damage ratios were calculated for each zone. Surface ground motions in each zone were estimated on the basis of base-rock motion simulation and shallow soil-column response analysis.

18427,"Incremental dynamic analysis and pushover analysis. A probabilistic comparison Capacity-spectrum-based-methods are also used for assessing the vulnerability and risk of existing buildings. Capacity curves are usually obtained by means of nonlinear static analysis. Incremental Dynamic Analysis is another powerful tool based on nonlinear dynamic analysis. This method is similar to the pushover analysis as the input is incrementally in-creased but it is different as it is based on dynamic analysis. Moreover, it is well known that the uncertainties associated to the structural response can be significant, because the uncer-tainties involved in the mechanical properties of the materials and the expected seismic ac-tions are also highly uncertain. In this work selected mechanical properties are considered as random variables and the seismic hazard is considered in a probabilistic way. A number of accelerograms of actual European seismic events have been selected in such a way that their response spectra fitted well the response spectra provided by the seismic codes for the zone where the target building is constructed. In this work a fully probabilistic approach is tackled by means of Monte Carlo simulation and it is applied to a detailed study of the seismic re-sponse of a reinforced concrete building. The building is representative for office buildings in Spain but the methods used and the results obtained can be extended to other types of build-ings. The main purposes of this work are 1) to analyze the differences when static and dy-namic techniques are used and 2) to obtain a measure of the uncertainties involved in the assessment of the vulnerability of structures. The results show that static based procedures are somehow conservative and that uncertainties increase with the severity of the seismic ac-tions and with the damage.

20669,"Seismic fragility curves for tall concrete wall building in Malaysia subjected to near-field earthquakes Tall buildings have been widely constructed in Malaysia, and most of them have been designed only for gravity and wind loads. This study addresses the seismic vulnerability of two tall concrete wall buildings in Malaysia through the framework of seismic fragility curves. The studied buildings shared a similar plan, but the first building had five parking levels while the second building had three parking levels. The structural system of both buildings at the parking levels was an ordinary moment-resisting frame, and at the residential levels was a low-ductile concrete shear wall system. The reference structures were subjected to 15 near-field earthquake records. Fragility curves were obtained by relating the inter-story drift demands to the peak ground accelerations using a reliable statistical model. It was observed that in both buildings, the probability of exceeding minor damage to the exterior frame was larger than that of the interior frame. Besides, a decrease in the number of parking levels increased the probability of collapse. It was also found that only minor damage was expected for tall concrete wall buildings in Kuala Lumpur when subjected to near-field earthquakes. © International Research Publication House.

18108,"Framework for the mainshock-aftershock fragility analysis of containment structures incorporating the effect of mainshock-damaged states In earthquake events, aftershocks triggered by a mainshock can impose further damage on buildings and then increase the seismic risk. This paper proposes a framework for the fragility evaluation of containment structures under mainshock-aftershock excitations, which can incorporate the impact of mainshock-damaged states effectively. In the proposed method, a joint seismic demand model of two random variables is established by using copula technique for the dependence modelling. To consider the influence of mainshock-damaged levels on the residual seismic capacity, bi-dimensional limit-state functions are used to measure the performance level of a structure during seismic sequences. Finally, the Monte Carlo method is adopted to develop fragility curves, allowing the influence of mainshock-damaged levels to be directly considered in the computation of failure probability. An example of a containment structure is presented to illustrate the use of this proposed methodology, and the sensitivity analysis of fragility curves is also carried out.

22086,"Update article: applicability of artificial neural networks to integrate socio-technical drivers of buildings recovery following extreme wind events In a companion article, previously published in Royal Society Open Science, the authors used graph theory to evaluate artificial neural network models for potential social and building variables interactions contributing to building wind damage. The results promisingly highlighted the importance of social variables in modelling damage as opposed to the traditional approach of solely considering the physical characteristics of a building. Within this update article, the same methods are used to evaluate two different artificial neural networks for modelling building repair and/or rebuild (recovery) time. By contrast to the damage models, the recovery models (RMs) consider (A) primarily social variables and then (B) introduce structural variables. These two models are then evaluated using centrality and shortest path concepts of graph theory as well as validated against data from the 2011 Joplin tornado. The results of this analysis do not show the same distinctions as were found in the analysis of the damage models from the companion article. The overarching lack of discernible and consistent differences in the RMs suggests that social variables that drive damage are not necessarily contributors to recovery. The differences also serve to reinforce that machine learning methods are best used when the contributing variables are already well understood. resilience  tornado  recovery  modelling None",Update article: applicability of artificial neural networks to integrate socio-technical drivers of buildings recovery following extreme wind events,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03625421670945935,0.009180975548666119,0.012625359820431944,0.9893812385458602,ML
21787,"The efficiency of an improved seismic vulnerability index under strong ground motions This paper examines the seismic performance of a Hospital Building damaged during the Ranau earthquake in Malaysia of intensity level (VIII), through an improved empirical seismic vulnerability index (SVI). The research aims at reducing the limitations and the uncertainties associated with the GNDT and the EMS approaches related to RC buildings, which can possibly be resolved by implementing the analytical techniques via applying nonlinear parametric analysis. Nonlinear time-history analyses were performed by incorporating an array of strong ground motions divided between far-field and near-field sets to assess the influence of each category on the SVI values and then comparing with SVI values obtained from the nonlinear static analysis (NSA).

17240,"Effect of the inelastic dynamic soil–structure interaction on the seismic vulnerability assessment This paper presents a study of the influence of inelastic dynamic soil–structure interaction (DSSI) on the seismic vulnerability assessment of buildings. The seismic vulnerability is evaluated in terms of analytical fragility curves constructed on the basis of non-linear dynamic finite elements (FE) analysis. An analytical sensibility strategy is introduced in order to define a suitable size of the motion database to be used for computing fragility curves. The fragility curves developed in this study are compared with reference curves. Concerning the effect of the inelastic DSSI, a general reduction of seismic demand when DSSI phenomena are included is found. Derived fragility curve reflects this seismic demand reduction. The importance of the ground motion database is highlighted in terms of the variability of parameters describing derived fragility curves. Comparison with reference curves are satisfactory. Findings illustrate clearly the importance and the advantages of an adequate DSSI effects evaluation.

12980,"Fragility curves for structures under tsunami loading Susceptibility to structural damage can be characterized by a fragility curve, which is expressed as a normal or lognormal cumulative distribution of the conditional probabilities of reaching or exceeding a particular damage state, for given values of the demand parameter. Such curves have been produced for a variety of damage states in different categories of buildings exposed to tsunami loading in different parts of the world, with the demand parameter taken as inundation depth. Harmonization was sought across these studies with respect to the median inundation depth. Three categories of single-storey buildings were identified based on construction material, namely reinforced concrete, masonry and timber. The median inundation depths for the complete damage state decreased from reinforced concrete (5.4–7.3 m) through masonry (2.3–2.5 m) to timber (~1.6 m) structures. The fairly narrow ranges above represent a number of different studies and indicate that a common family of curves or “bands” can be arrived at. Such ranges were identified for other partial damage states too. Our genuinely original contribution is a probabilistic model that was developed using a Monte Carlo simulation to produce synthetic fragility functions for masonry and reinforced concrete structures under tsunami loading. The probabilistic model consisted of a geometric model that captured the geometrical and wall-type variations of the building lot, a loading function and a set of failure criteria, all of which required appropriate simplifying assumptions. The resulting synthetic fragility curves matched the fragility curves based on observed tsunami damage for the complete collapse damage state reasonably well. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

18720,"Life-safety seismic risk estimation for buildings a methodology to prioritize buildings in a seismic rehabilitation program A methodology is presented to produce an annualized-loss-of-life (ALOL) estimate for a seismically deficient building given a minimum amount of building data. The ALOL estimates are used to indicate the need for rehabilitation and if necessary, rank the priority of the project in a seismic rehabilitation program. The estimated ALOL for any given building is calculated by considering the probability of the seismic loading, the probability of the loading resulting in a certain failure and the consequences of that failure. The probability of the loading is based on the recurrence period or the annual probability of exceedance of the earthquake. The probability of failure is defined by the structural response of the building to the loading. The consequence of the loading is defined as the result of the structural response. The result of total structural collapse is quantified in terms of the building occupants that are at risk of loss-of-life. Hazard Curves are used to relate the ground motion to the earthquake recurrence period at a specific site. The Hazard Curves are divided into discrete segments and the ALOL is generated for each segment. The total ALOL for the specific building is the sum of all the individual ALOL estimates thereby incorporating the entire Hazard Curve into the ALOL estimate for each building. These techniques include generating a demand spectrum using the buildings' effective damping, generating a building capacity or pushover curve, superimposing the two to find the intersecting displacement, and using that displacement with a fragility curve to estimate the probability of exceeding a given damage state.

21144,"Seismic vulnerability assessment of high-rise non-ductile RC buildings considering soil–structure interaction effects Traditionally fragility curves of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings are estimated with the assumption of fixed base structures. The objective of the present research is to study whether soil-structure interaction (SSI) and site effects may affect the seismic performance and vulnerability of reinforced concrete moment resisting frame (MRF) buildings and consequently modify the fragility curves. SSI is modeled applying the direct one-step approach considering either linear elastic or nonlinear soil behavior while site effects are inherently accounted for. To further examine the contribution of site and SSI effects, a two-step uncoupled approach is also applied, which takes into account site effects on the response of the fixed base structure, but neglects SSI effects. Additional analyses are performed investigating the influence of the soil depth and stratigraphy under nonlinear soil behavior on the seismic response and fragility of RC buildings. A 9-story RC MRF designed with low seismic code provisions is adopted as a reference structure. A comparative dynamic analysis is performed highlighting various trends in the seismic response of the considered SSI and fixed base systems. Fragility curves are derived as a function of rock outcropping peak ground acceleration for the immediate occupancy and collapse prevention limit states for the fixed base and SSI models based on the statistical exploitation of the results of incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) of the given structural systems. Results show the significant role of SSI and site effects under linear or nonlinear soil behavior in altering the expected structural performance and fragility of high-rise fixed base structures.

19100,"New tsunami damage functions developed in the framework of SCHEMA project: Application to European-Mediterranean coasts In the framework of the European SCenarios for tsunami Hazard-induced Emergencies MAnagement (SCHEMA) project (schemaproject.org), we empirically developed new tsunami damage functions to be used for quantifying the potential tsunami damage to buildings along European-Mediterranean coasts. Since no sufficient post-tsunami observations exist in the Mediterranean areas, we based our work on data collected by several authors in Banda Aceh (Indonesia) after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Obviously, special attention has been paid in focusing on Indonesian buildings which present similarities (in structure, construction material, number of storeys) with the building typologies typical of the European-Mediterranean areas. An important part of the work consisted in analyzing, merging, and interpolating the post-disaster observations published by three independent teams in order to obtain the spatial distribution of flow depths necessary to link the flow-depth hazard parameter to the damage level observed on buildings. Then we developed fragility curves (showing the cumulative probability to have, for each flow depth, a damage level equal-to or greater-than a given threshold) and damage curves (giving the expected damage level) for different classes of buildings. It appears that damage curves based on the weighted mean damage level and the maximum flow depth are the most appropriate for producing, under GIS, expected damage maps for different tsunami scenarios. © 2011 Author(s).

12508,"A comparative analysis of empirical and analytical tsunami fragility functions for buildings in Tumaco, Colombia The Pacific coast of Colombia has witnessed several tsunami events in the last century. However, the physical damage to structures at the time was not recorded, even when these events have brought overwhelming destruction to coastal communities. This lack of data increases uncertainties when assessing future tsunami impacts. Nonetheless, other regions of the world, which have been also affected by tsunami, have collected damage information that has been used to build empirical tsunami fragility functions. Based on a demand parameter, such as the tsunami inundation depth, a fragility function expresses the probability of building damage. Hence, regions with no recent tsunami damage cannot develop empirical fragility functions since post-disaster damage survey data is not available. One alternative for these regions is to develop analytical fragility functions out of computational nonlinear structural analysis.

21221,"Seismic vulnerability of bhutanese vernacular stone masonry buildings: From damage observation to fragility analysis A moderate earthquake of local magnitude 6.4 occurred in Sonitpur Assam, India on April 28, 2021. Although the earthquake occurred in India, Bhutan suffered considerable damage to structures and infrastructures, especially in the eastern districts. Due to inherent vulnerabilities of Bhutanese residential buildings, encapsulated in rural stone masonry and rammed earth construction, widespread damages were reported in many districts although the shaking was moderate only. We report the damage mechanisms observed in buildings and infrastructures and juxtapose the mechanisms with seismic vulnerability of Bhutanese residential buildings using analytical and empirical approaches. Finite element analysis is performed to validate the failure mechanisms. Intensity map for the earthquake is constructed based on the damage description and vulnerability curve is derived for rural stone masonry building class using the damage data of 2009, 2011, and 2021 earthquakes. The sum of observations and analyses highlights that the Bhutanese residential buildings are likely to be damaged considerably even by moderate shaking, and their capacities are expected to be far exceeded by strong shaking.

15651,"APPLICATION OF DIFFERENT SEISMIC ANALYSES TO RC STRUCTURES Static and dynamic methods of nonlinear seismic analysis for reinforced concrete non-seismic buildings are presented in this paper. The ICONS experimental model was used on a reinforced concrete four-story frame with three bays, which was calibrated with a numerical nonlinear model. The chosen earthquake record was a moderate-strong scenario of the European Seismic Hazard. The numerical model showed excellent correlation with the experimental behavior of the ICONS model. The methods that were used in this study are as follows: pushover analysis, time history analysis, and incremental dynamic analysis. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are described, and the results obtained by their application are presented. The pushover analysis shows the expected global response of the structure, which is confirmed by the numerical results and recommendations for performance levels. The results obtained from the time history analysis are interstory drift profiles based on three different peak ground accelerations.

22016,"Two frugal options to assess class fragility and seismic safety for low-rise reinforced concrete school buildings in Southern Italy A study is presented on the seismic fragility of a sample of 15 reinforced-concrete school buildings built between 1960 and 1980s in the province of Foggia, Southern Italy, for which near-perfect information is provided on geometrical and mechanical parameters. In particular, the focus is on the application of two probabilistic methods, employing different compromises in terms of complexity versus accuracy. First, a Eurocode 8 compatible nonlinear static approach is employed, which is augmented via the use of the regression expressions of the SPO2FRAG tool to incorporate record-to-record variability. Second, a nonlinear dynamic approach is used to directly account for record-to-record variability via a constrained multi-stripe analysis. In particular, in view of practitioners’ needs (analysis time, computational efforts, software used), a practical mode for application of the multi-stripe analyses is proposed, based on conducting few stripe analyses, in order to predict the behavior of structures in both the elastic and inelastic ranges of response. Both the static and the dynamic approaches are shown to be viable alternatives, offering fairly matching results at the individual building-level and even closer predictions at the level of ensemble regional fragility curves that incorporate both inter-building and intra-building uncertainties. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.

18465,"Influence of flood frequency on residential building losses For the purpose of flood risk analysis, reliable loss models are an indispensable need. The most common models use stage-damage functions relating damage to water depth. They are often derived from empirical flood loss data (i.e. loss data collected after a flood event). However, object specific loss data (e.g. losses of single residential buildings) from recent flood events in Germany showed higher average losses in less probable events, regardless of actual water level. Hence, models that were derived from such data tend to overestimate losses caused by more probable events. Therefore, it is the aim of the study to analyse the relation between flood damage and recurrence interval and to propose a method for considering recurrence interval in flood loss modelling. The survey was based on residential building loss data (n=2158) of recent flood events in 2002, 2005 and 2006 in Germany and on-site recurrence interval of the respective events. We discovered a highly significant positive correlation between loss extent and recurrence interval for classified water levels as well as increasing average losses for longer recurrence intervals within each class. The application of principal component analysis revealed the interrelation between factors that influence the damage extent directly or indirectly, and recurrence interval. No single factor or component could be identified that explained the influence of recurrence interval, which led to the conclusion that recurrence interval cannot substitute, but complement other damage influencing factors in flood loss modelling approaches. Finally, a method was developed to include recurrence interval in typical flood loss models and make them applicable to a wider range of flood events. Validation including statistical error analysis showed that the modified models improve loss estimates in comparison to traditional approaches. The proposed multi-parameter model FLEMOps+r performs particularly well. © Author(s) 2010.

17976,"Fragility assessment of the Italian masonry school building asset for risk evaluation at national scale Seismic risk and scenario assessments at large-scale provide important science-based tools to support governments and civil protection departments in investment policies and emergency planning. In this framework, school buildings are particularly significant due to the consequences of their damage or collapse and their relevance, as public buildings, in emergency planning. The evaluation of risk requires the definition of its components, i.e., hazard, exposure and vulnerability. To assess the seismic vulnerability of masonry school building assets, this paper presents the fragility curves derived for 265 building types, based on the Italian school building census. Parametric analyses were carried out on 14 representative prototype schools, using a mechanics-based model which considers both in-plane and out-of-plane mechanisms. More than 7500 sample fragilities were calculated and linearly combined to obtain fragility curves representing the Italian taxonomy of masonry school buildings. A macro-seismic heuristic model from the literature was then calibrated to derive a fragility set for each school type, for five damage states, from slight damage to complete collapse. Finally, the paper compares the outcome fragility curves and fragility sets from the literature for residential buildings, highlighting the specificities of school seismic vulnerability. Indeed, masonry school buildings are frequently characterized by intrinsic geometric deficiencies due to significant inter-story height and great distance between transverse walls, both affecting the out-of-plane response and, therefore, the overall seismic fragility. © 2021 COMPDYN Proceedings.

This paper develops predictive hurricane, multi-hazard, single-family building fragility models for ordered categorical damage states (DS) and binary complete failure/non-complete failure using proportional odds cumulative logit and logistic regression models, respectively. In addition to their simplicity, these models are able to represent multiple hurricane hazard variables and include variable interactions, thus improving model fitting and damage prediction. Surveys of physical damage in coastal Mississippi following Hurricane Katrina (2005) and high-resolution numerical hindcast hazard intensities from the Simulating WAves Nearshore and ADvanced CIRCulation (SWAN + ADCIRC) models are used as model input. Prediction accuracy is expressed in terms of cross-validation (CV) and evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). Thirty-nine combinations of global damage response variables were investigated. Of these models, six DS and one complete failure model met the evaluation criteria. Maximum significant wave height was the only significant hazard variable for the DS models, while maximum 3-s gust wind speed, maximum surge depth, and maximum water speed were found to be significant predictors for the complete failure model.

15951,"Building and validating geographically refined hurricane wind risk models for residential structures Accurate estimation of risk to residential structures from hurricane winds is critical for emergency planning and post-event recovery. Models based on fragility curves are widely used for assessing wind damage risk at the county and census tract levels.

This paper has three aims: (1) to evaluate the predictive accuracy of fragility-curve-based models at the census tract level using a comprehensive damage data set for Harris County residences collected after Hurricane Ike in 2008, (2) to demonstrate the need for geographically refined models of wind damage risk at spatial scales of 1-km2 blocks and to analyze the performance of fragility-curve models at that level, and (3) to explore the sources of errors made by fragility-curve-based models at the census tract and 1-km2-block level using a statistical machine learning model constructed from 21 potential explanatory variables.

12777,"Development and application of a tsunami fragility curve of the 2015 tsunami in Coquimbo, Chile The last earthquake that affected the city of Coquimbo took place in September 2015 and had a magnitude of M-w = 8.3, resulting in localized damage in low-lying areas of the city. In addition, another seismic gap north of the 2015 earthquake rupture area has been identified; therefore, a significant earthquake (M-w = 8.2 to 8.5) and tsunami could occur in the near future. The present paper develops a tsunami fragility curve for the city of Coquimbo based on field survey data and tsunami numerical simulations. The inundation depth of the 2015 Chile tsunami in Coquimbo was estimated by means of numerical simulation with the Non-hydrostatic Evolution of Ocean WAVEs (NEOWAVE) model and five nested grids with a maximum grid resolution of 10 m. The fragility curve exhibited behavior similar to that of other curves in flat areas in Japan, where little damage was observed at relatively high inundation depths. In addition, it was observed that Coquimbo experienced less damage than Dichato (Chile); in fact, at an inundation depth of 2 m, Dichato had a similar to 75% probability of damage, while Coquimbo proved to have only a 20% probability. The new fragility curve was used to estimate the damage by possible future tsunamis in the area. The damage assessment showed that similar to 50% of the structures in the low-lying area of Coquimbo have a high probability of damage in the case of a tsunami generated off the coast of the study area if the city is rebuilt with the same types of structures.

20728,"Seismic fragility of regular masonry buildings for in-plane and out-of-plane failure The seismic vulnerability of stone masonry buildings is studied on the basis of their fragility curves. In order to account for out-of-plane failure modes, normally disregarded in past studies, linear static Finite Element analysis in 3D of prototype regular buildings is performed using a nonlinear biaxial failure criterion for masonry. More than 1100 analyses are carried out, so as to cover the practical range of the most important parameters, namely the number of storeys, percentage of side length in exterior walls taken up by openings, wall thickness, plan dimensions and number of interior walls, type of floor and pier height-to-length ratio. Results are presented in the form of damage and fragility curves. The fragility curves correspond well to the damage observed in masonry buildings after strong earthquakes and are in good agreement with other fragility curves in the literature. They confirm what is already known, namely that buildings with stiff floors or higher percentage of load-bearing walls are less vulnerable, and that large openings, taller storeys, larger number of storeys, higher wall slenderness and higher ratio of clear height to horizontal length of walls increase the vulnerability, but show also by how much. © 2014 Techno-Press, Ltd.

20738,"SEISMIC FRAGILITY STUDY FOR HIGH-PRESSURE EMERGENCY COOLING WATER TANKS OF LOVIISA NUCLEAR POWER PLANT The paper studies the fragility of high-pressure emergency cooling water tanks in Loviisa Nuclear Power Plant located on the elevation +25.40 in the reactor building. The seismic fragility is defined as the conditional probability of its failure given a value of the response parameter, such as peak ground acceleration. Using the lognormal-distribution assumption, the fragility (i.e., the probability of failure, f') at any non-exceedance probability level Q can be derived as Equation 1 f' = Phi[(ln(a/(A) under bar) +beta(U)Phi(-1) (Q))/beta(R)] where Q = P(f < f'vertical bar a) is the probability that the conditional probability f is less than f for a peak ground acceleration a. <(A)under bar> is the median ground acceleration capacity, beta(R) is the logarithmic standard deviation representing the randomness about A, and beta(U) is the logarithmic standard deviation representing the uncertainty. The quantity Phi(.) is the standard Gaussian cumulative distribution function. In order to assess the fragility of the tanks the strain time histories for tank supports and piping nozzles were calculated using the joint structural-equipment model. The ground motion response spectra shape used in the structural response analysis has been taken from the YVL 2.6 - guide [1]. This shape represents the envelope spectrum for Southern Finland corresponding to the median annual frequency of 10(-5). The sampling of the model properties was carried out with the aid of the Latin hypercube sampling method. In order to find the failure modes the strain time histories were calculated for the piping nozzles and for support structures of the tanks. Since strain is the best measure of energy absorption, energy limited events need to be based on the strain acceptance criteria. The adopted failure limit is the cumulated plastic strain of 8% in the tank sheet metal or in the supporting structures. This failure limit has taken from the reference [2]. The end result of the study is the presentation of the median fragility curve for the tanks as well as 95% and 5% fractile curves.

The structure is located in Seismic Zone 4, considered the highest-seismic-risk classification established by the U.S. Geological Survey. 3D finite element model was created in commercially available finite element software. As part of the seismic performance evaluation, two standard approaches for the structure seismic analysis were used; response spectrum analysis and nonlinear time-history analysis. Both approaches were used to compute inter-story drift ratios of the structure. Seismic fragility curves for each floor of the structure were generated using the ratios from the time history analysis with the FEMA guideline so as to evaluate their seismic vulnerability. The ratios from both approaches were compared to FEMA and LATBSDC limits. The findings revealed that the floor-level fragility mostly decreased for all the FEMA performance levels with an increase in height and the ratios from both approaches mostly satisfied the codified limits. multistory reinforced concrete structure  response spectrum analysis  nonlinear time history analysis  inter-story drift ratios  seismic fragility curves FRAGILITY ANALYSIS  STEEL  RISK",Seismic Performance Evaluation of Multistory Reinforced Concrete Moment Resisting Frame Structure with Shear Walls,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4329607998289641,0.009262979787802186,0.007860411107342837,0.04373243907502909,Analytical

19935,"Rapid earthquake loss assessment based on machine learning and representative sampling This article proposes a new framework for rapid earthquake loss assessment based on a machine learning damage classification model and a representative sampling algorithm. A random forest classification model predicts a damage probability distribution that, combined with an expert-defined repair cost matrix, enables the calculation of the expected repair costs for each building and, in aggregate, of direct losses in the earthquake-affected area. The proposed building representation does not include explicit information about the earthquake and the soil type. Instead, such information is implicitly contained in the spatial distribution of damage. To capture this distribution, a sampling algorithm, based on K-means clustering, is used to select a minimal number of buildings that represent the area of interest in terms of its seismic risk, independently of future earthquakes. To observe damage states in the representative set after an earthquake, the proposed framework utilizes a local network of trained damage assessors. The model is updated after each damage observation cycle, thus increasing the accuracy of the current loss assessment. The proposed framework is exemplified using the 2010 Kraljevo, Serbia earthquake dataset. © The Author(s) 2021. building type  damage state  Earthquake  loss assessment  machine learning  sampling algorithm Damage detection  Decision trees  K-means clustering  Learning algorithms  Machine learning  Probability distributions  Turing machines  Affected area  Area of interest  Damage classification  Explicit information  Local networks  Random forest classification  Representative sampling  Sampling algorithm  Earthquakes  algorithm  assessment method  building  earthquake damage  machine learning  sampling  Kraljevo  Serbia",Rapid earthquake loss assessment based on machine learning and representative sampling,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02417159582292363,0.005794523244024617,0.05649375551583908,0.6491686596905812,ML

Time history analyses were performed on the 13 model buildings and fragility curves relating the probability of reaching or exceeding four predefined damage states to peak ground acceleration (PGA) were established for the 13 model building types. The fragility curves were then used to assess the structural risk of the model buildings and estimate the associated human and economic losses for various earthquake scenarios.

18748,"Loss estimation analysis of flat-slab structures The paper is concerned with loss estimation analysis of flat-slab structures, a reinforced concrete structural form that exhibits behavior and response patterns distinct from conventional moment frames. The fragility information obtained for flat-slab structures presented in a companion paper is implemented into HAZUS, the loss assessment software of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The latter program includes many existing structural types, but does not deal with flat-slab structures. For implementation purposes, the fragility curves should be in a format consistent with fragilities already available in HAZUS. The latter objective is achieved by making use of the response statistics and employing the capacity spectrum method. After implementation, the earthquake losses in flat-slab buildings are predicted in comparison with the existing structural types in HAZUS by using different scenario earthquakes for a selected study region. The prediction results are consistent with the seismic response characteristics of the compared structural types. © ASCE.

The fragility curves are generally obtained based on a large number of time history analyses. In order to better simulate steel frames, the material and geometric uncertainties are considered. The moderate earthquake records are selected as the earthquake samples. Then the seismic damages induced by these samples are obtained using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) program. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained by these seismic damage data. Then the trained ANN is used to predict the seismic damage of the steel frame.

19704,"Probabilistic damage assessment of buildings due to induced seismicity Natural gas production in the Groningen field in the Netherlands is causing induced earthquakes that have raised concerns regarding the safety of the local population given that the exposed building stock (which is predominantly unreinforced masonry residential housing) has not been designed and constructed considering seismic loading. Significant effort has been invested to date in assessing the safety risk of these buildings within a probabilistic framework. This paper describes the efforts that have since been made to extend this framework for probabilistic damage assessment of the buildings, for slight non-structural, slight structural and moderate structural damage. Fragility functions for non-structural damage have been developed considering the observed damage from damage reports, rather than from damage claims due to a number of issues with the latter, as described herein. Structural damage has been estimated using analytical models that have been calibrated through extensive in situ data collection and experimental testing. The probabilistic damage assessment is presented in terms of F-N curves, which plot the annual frequency of exceedance against number of buildings reaching each damage state. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

20756,"Seismic Loss Estimates for Scenarios of the 1940 Vrancea Earthquake One of the strongest earthquake in Romania was the Vrancea earthquake on 10 November 1940, with moment magnitude 7.7 and depth of 150 km. This event caused significant losses over a wide territory, up to Iasi and Craiova cities. The number of casualties in Romania was around 593 dead and 1271 injured and 65,000 homes were destroyed. A major questions nowadays is: What could the consequences of a similar earthquake be?. Through this paper we try to provide insights, by relying on the newly implemented System for Estimating the Seismic Damage in Romania (SeisDaRo), operated by National Institute for Earth Physics (NIEP). This system uses the Improved-Displacement Capacity Analytical Method implemented in the SELENA Software for expressing building loss probabilities. The building database (at city or commune level) is classified into 48 types (depending on construction material, height and age), each with a specific capacity and fragility curve. For this paper we also compute casualty estimates. In the absence of real seismic recordings from the 1940 earthquake we obtained hazard parameters through different ground motion prediction equations (developed by Sokolov, Marmureanu or Vacareanu) specific for the Vrancea intermediate-depth source. Also we test the possibility of using data converted from intensity to acceleration. The damage estimates are represented on relevant maps. Our results show that an earthquake like the one on 1940 could lead to significant damage in our times.

20153,"Revision and improvement of the PTVA-3 model for assessing tsunami building vulnerability using international expert judgment: introducing the PTVA-4 model This work reviewed, assessed, enhanced and field-tested one of the most widely used index-based methods for assessing the vulnerability of buildings to tsunamis: the Papathoma Tsunami Vulnerability Assessment (PTVA) model. The review and assessment were undertaken through a participatory survey process engaging authors of scientific literature during 2005-2015 in the field of building vulnerability to tsunamis. Expert respondents updated the weights of the PTVA building vulnerability attributes based on their expertise and insights from the 2011 Tohoku Tsunami. The respondents were also free to suggest additional PTVA building attributes and to provide open comments on the model. We then analysed the outcomes of the questionnaire and we used them to generate a new improved version of the model, the PTVA-4, which we field-tested in the area of Botany Bay (Sydney), New South Wales. Using a cohort of over 2000 buildings and a tsunami scenario numerically simulated using state-of-the-art hydrodynamic modelling techniques, we applied the PTVA-4 model and compared the outcomes against its predecessor (i.e. the PTVA-3). Results showed the PTVA-4 model is significantly more accurate and more sensitive to variations in the tsunami demand parameter, the attributes of the exposed buildings and their surroundings. The PTVA-4 model is the first tool of its kind to integrate the judgment of specialised scientists worldwide. It constitutes a viable option to assess the vulnerability of buildings in areas where no tsunami vulnerability curves have been developed yet, or to consider the contribution to vulnerability given by a significantly wider range of building engineering and physical attributes. An ArcGIS toolbox that automatically calculates the relative vulnerability of buildings using the new PTVA-4 model is attached to this paper.

16310,"COMPONENT-BASED SEVERE WIND VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS OF WOODEN BUILDINGS IN THE PHILIPPINES The Northwestern Pacific Ocean Basin is home to the strongest tropical cyclones in the world, called typhoons. The Philippines is situated as the gateway for the typhoons developing in the Northwestern Pacific Basin. As a result, the country is being exposed to the risk brought by significantly strong typhoons that occur more than once annually. Lightweight buildings, particularly wooden buildings, and their structural components are the most vulnerable to severe winds. This study aims to perform vulnerability analysis on wooden buildings, by developing vulnerability curves that relate the magnitude of severe winds to the variation of damages and by establishing the probabilities of identified damage states of the buildings at certain wind speeds - which are called fragility curves. This study employs an improved framework from a heuristic-empirical-computational methodology previously used in determining GMMA-RAP vulnerability curves. This enhanced framework uses a component-based Monte Carlo vulnerability analysis to determine the improved vulnerability curve to account for the statistical variations of documented building damage from severe winds. A maximum, average, and minimum vulnerability curve were developed by fitting a cumulative lognormal distribution function wherein the mean parameters are 250.92, 425.89, 148.80, and the variance parameters are 0.579, 0.257, 0.433, respectively - the functions used an offset of 72 kph for all the developed curves.

21010,"Seismic risk assessment of an old RC frame-wall building in Lisbon This study investigates the structural vulnerability of an old reinforced concrete dual wall-frame building structure, in Lisbon, Portugal. The building presents non-ductile behaviour and detailing typical of buildings designed before the introduction of modern seismic codes (pre– 1980). An analytical methodology is adopted in which multiple stripe analysis are performed on a three-dimensional model of the building. Fragility and vulnerability functions are developed for this structure, representative of a typology of old RC buildings. The fragility is derived taking into account the brittle shear failures of RC vertical members, i.e. columns and shear walls. The nonlinear dynamic analyses clearly indicate that these failure modes have a critical influence on the seismic performance of the structure. The results of this study can be used for seismic loss assessment and for the identification of appropriate mitigation strategies for this typology of existing RC buildings. © 2019 IABSE.

16942,"Development of seismic vulnerability index methodology for reinforced concrete buildings based on nonlinear parametric analyses This paper presents a simplified method in the seismic vulnerability assessment of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings based on proposed seismic vulnerability index (SVI) methodology. The employed procedure is derived with some modifications from the Italian GNDT and the European Macro-seismic approaches. Eight parameters were modeled in three distinct vulnerability classes to estimate the vulnerability indices of RC structures. The vulnerability classes were categorized based on the earthquake resistant design (ERD) defined as; (Low, Moderate, and High)-ERDs. Nonlinear time history analysis (NL-THA) and nonlinear static analysis (NL-SA) were carried out to define the weight of each parameter in order to calculate the seismic vulnerability index in a specific intensity (PGA) of an earthquake event. Knowing that it ranges from 0 to 1 from less vulnerable to most vulnerable with respect to the seismic intensity. In addition, the engineering demand parameter (EDP) used to determine the vulnerability index as the maximum top displacement of the structure. After determining the (SVI), The mean damage states were developed to evaluate the estimated physical damage of buildings in distinct seismic intensities. •This simplified methodology helps to manage and implements strategies for the safety of the communities before earthquake takes place by investigating the vulnerability classes for each building type.•Modeling the parameters that have an influence on the structural behavior without considering the past-damages observations through an analytical approach.•Developing the seismic vulnerability index can reduce or limit the role of the rapid visual screening methods, which is based on expert opinion decisions, and depends on observations of damages caused by earthquakes, and can be a useful framework criterion in earthquake filed.

17344,"Empirical fragility curves based on random ground shaking fields: Employing Copernicus-EMS damage grading maps for 2016 amatrice sequence Significant structural and non-structural damage suffered by residential buildings due to recent earthquakes world-wide provide a sad testimony to the vulnerability of the existing building stock. This evidence stresses the need to develop accurate seismic vulnerability assessment tools in the service of strategic planning and applicable at a territorial scale. The empirical fragility curves have been used quite often in order to characterize the vulnerability of prescribed buildings classes as opposed to individual buildings. In this approach, the fragility curve represents both the building-to-building variability within the class and the uncertainty in the building class response to future earthquakes. Development of empirical fragility curves for classes of buildings depends to a large extent on the pairs of seismic ground shaking intensity and observed damage data gathered from spatially distributed buildings. The seismic intensity experienced at the site of each building is usually estimated by employing maps of ground shaking for the earthquake of interest (a.k.a., shakeMaps). The accuracy in the estimation of the ground shaking intensity is arguably as important as that of the evaluation of the incurred damage. The former involves explicit characterization of the uncertainties in the ground-shaking intensity estimation. This can be achieved through application of ground motion prediction equations and the corresponding spatial correlation structure in the residuals (of the predictive equation), resulting in generation of random fields of ground shaking. Each field represents a plausible distribution of ground motion intensity for a given earthquake scenario. Then, the random ground shaking field can be updated based on available observations of ground shaking intensity from nearby stations. The generated random fields can be further modified to consider the local stratigraphic and topographic amplification. For a given damage pattern observed for a prescribed building class, the generation of random ground motion fields leads to a set of plausible empirical fragility curves (corresponding to exceedance of different damage states). The fragility curves and their 16th, 50th and 84th percentiles, obtained based on the generated random ground shaking fields and observed damage in the aftermath of Amatrice 2016 Earthquake (based on Copernicus EMS damage maps) show reasonable agreement with the empirical fragility curves available in the literature for similar buildings classes. © 2019 The authors.

20659,"Seismic fragility curves for mid-rise RC frames designed according to Iranian seismic code The uncertain nature of future ground motions is leading to development of probabilistic structural damage estimation procedures. Fragility curves are useful tools for showing the probability of structural damage due to earthquakes as a function of ground motion indices. The contribution of this study is to develop the fragility curves for mid-rise RC frames designed according to the Iranian Seismic Design Code.

Based on those ratio fragility curves were developed in terms of peak ground acceleration for immediate occupancy and life safety damage levels with lognormal distribution assumption.

15948,"Broad-band 3-D earthquake simulation at nuclear site by an all-embracing source-to-structure approach The scope of this paper is to give an insight into the advantages of a new, all-embracing, modeling approach of a strong ground motion scenario, by carrying out a source-to-structure analysis at regional scale, accounting explicitly for the uncertainties related to the databases and the models. To this end, a suitable case-study is represented by the 2007 Mw6.6 Niigata-Ken Chūetsu-Oki seismic sequence (west Japan), that damaged the Kashiwazaki Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant. This study describes the effect of the wave propagation path within the Earth's crust on the seismic response of nuclear reactor buildings located nearby a seismogenic source. The multiscale problem is de-coupled into three steps: (1) a parallel simulation of seismic-wave propagation throughout the Earth's crust at regional scale (≈ 60 km wide, major 3-D geological interfaces found below the nuclear site), reliable up to 5.0 Hz; (2) a mid hybridization step consisting in enriching the synthetic wave-field at high frequency (up to 30 Hz), employing an Artificial Neural Network to predict the short-period (SP) spectral ordinates; (3) a high-resolution structural dynamic analysis, introducing the hybrid broad-band synthetics as input wave-motion. A simplified stress-test is performed, by simulating two small point-wise aftershocks at different source-site position. The impact of the underground 3-D geology on the structural components is finally quantified, by injecting the obtained broad-band time-histories in a Soil-Structure Interaction (SSI) model of the nuclear reactor building.

18669,"Kriging Metamodel-Based Seismic Fragility Analysis of Single-Bent Reinforced Concrete Highway Bridges Uncertainty quantification is an important issue in the seismic fragility analysis of bridge type structures. However, the influence of different sources of uncertainty on the seismic fragility of the system is commonly overlooked due to the costly re-evaluation of numerical model simulations. This paper aims to present a framework for the seismic fragility analysis of reinforced concrete highway bridges, where a data-driven metamodel is developed to approximate the structural response to structural and ground motion uncertainties. The proposed framework to generate fragility curves shows its efficiency while using a few finite element simulations and accounting for various modeling uncertainties influencing the bridge seismic fragility. In this respect, a class of single-bent bridges available in the literature is taken as a case study, whose three-dimensional finite element model is established by the OpenSees software framework. Twenty near-source records from different sources are selected and the Latin hypercube method is applied for generating the random samples of modeling and ground motion parameters. The Kriging metamodel is then driven on the structural response obtained from nonlinear time history analyses. Component fragility curves of the reinforced concrete pier column are derived for different damage states using the Kriging metamodel whose parameters are established considering different modeling parameters generated by Monte Carlo simulations. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework in interpolating the structural response and deriving the fragility curve of the case study with any input conditions of the random variables. fragility analysis  kriging metamodel  reinforced concrete bridge  nonlinear time history analysis  Monte Carlo simulation SURROGATE MODELS  EARTHQUAKE",Kriging Metamodel-Based Seismic Fragility Analysis of Single-Bent Reinforced Concrete Highway Bridges,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.464157658667738,0.006513020985544947,0.015872420739634633,0.15908285826929147,Analytical
12612,"Application of the SP-BELA methodology to RC residential buildings in Italy to produce seismic risk maps for the national risk assessment This article deals with the application of an analytical methodology for the large-scale vulnerability assessment of reinforced concrete frame buildings in Italy. This methodology is known in the technical literature with the acronym SP-BELA (Simplified Pushover-Based Earthquake Loss Assessment) and has been adopted by the Eucentre research group to contribute to the production of the seismic risk maps in Italy, published in the National Risk Assessment document. The Italian maps were elaborated using the IRMA platform (Italian Risk MAps), which is a web platform developed by Eucentre. The IRMA platform is only addressed to the scientific community who can use it to share data, methods, and models for the evaluation of the seismic risk in Italy (Borzi et al. in Piattaforma IRMA Italian Risk MAps, 2018; Dolce et al. in Mappe di rischio per il territorio Italiano, 2019a; Faravelli et al. in Italian platform for seismic risk and damage scenario evaluation, 2019a, Borzi et al. in Bull Earthq Eng, 2020, Dolce et al. Bull Earthq Eng, 2020). SP-BELA defines the non-linear behaviour of a random population of buildings through a simplified pushover and a displacement-based procedure. Specifically, displacement capacity limits are identified on the pushover curve and then they are compared with the displacement demand from a response spectrum of each building in the random population. In this way, it is possible to define the probability of exceedance of the damage limits and hence generate the fragility curves. Then, the resulting curves have been calibrated by comparing the damage data observed on the reinforced concrete buildings with the damage analytically calculated with SP-BELA for the earthquakes of Molise 2002 and L’Aquila 2009. The final curves have been uploaded into the IRMA platform and used to produce damage maps for the entire national territory. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

21153,"Seismic vulnerability assessment of historical masonry buildings located in Annaba city (Algeria) using non ad-hoc data survey Seismic vulnerability analysis of historical masonry buildings, addressed to earthquake emergency management and protection strategy planning, requires large-scale vulnerability and damage assessment. In this sense, two seismic vulnerability index methods and damage estimation have been adapted and applied to a pilot-scale urban area located in Annaba city (Algeria). The first method is based on the EMS-98 building typologies, and the second is based on the Italian GNDT approach. To accomplish this task, the authors employed an existing data survey, which, however, was not originally developed for seismic purposes. It was used herein to provide input to the vulnerability methods. The main goal of this research is not only to assess the seismic vulnerability and expected damage within Annaba, but also to adapt the two mentioned approaches to the existing data survey, aiming to use such nonspecific building database and to study the possibility of its application for seismic risk estimation in similar regions. The results obtained from the application of these two methods were integrated and compared using a geographic information system, proving that the vulnerability of the buildings surveyed in Annaba is significant, and therefore risk mitigation efforts and public awareness are required. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

16256,"Comparative seismic RISK assessment of existing RC buildings using seismic vulnerability index approach The implementation of seismic risk management is becoming increasingly important all over the world, and especially in East-Asia as the structures aging surpass. In this context, three existing reinforced concrete buildings located in Malaysia have been selected for seismic vulnerability assessment. This work aims to apply the Seismic Vulnerability Index (SVI) via a Non-Linear Parametric Analysis (NL-PA) for each of the 3 RC existing buildings having different storey levels and clusters; low-rise (BLR), mid-rise (BMR), and high-rise (BHR). This approach can be achieved by undertaking a NL-PA as an analytical strategy instead of the empirical approach, which relies primarily on physical vulnerability parameters, earthquake-resistant design (ERD), and engineering demand parameters (EDP) by simulating a set of seismic records that can define the fragility features. The assessed SVI values for three different clusters of buildings are obtained for Far-Field (FF) and Near-Field (NF) seismic scenarios. With regards to the non-linear static analysis (NL-SA), the SVI values interact very well with the findings acquired from the NL-DA which are in good compliance with the low-rise building, in contrast for the two mid- and high-rise buildings. According to the obtained probabilistic vulnerability curves, the reference buildings are classified to be in D2 and D3 damage grades with dominancy of D3 level for the mid-rise and high-rise structures. © 2021 Institution of Structural Engineers Fragility Curves  Nonlinear Analysis  Parametric Analysis  Seismic Vulnerability Index (SVI)  Vulnerability Classes None",Comparative seismic RISK assessment of existing RC buildings using seismic vulnerability index approach,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28222259735900623,0.2661965063818038,0.08567510300740674,0.022890110171115502,Analytical
19287,"On the Influence of the Main Floor Layout of Buildings in Economic Flood Risk Assessment: Results from Central Spain Multiple studies have been carried out on the correct estimation of the damages (direct tangible losses) associated with floods. However, the complex analysis and the multitude of variables conditioning the damage estimation, as well as the uncertainty in their estimation, make it difficult, even today, to reach one single, complete solution to this problem. In no case has the influence that the topographic relationship between the main floor of a residential building and the surrounding land have in the estimation of flood economic damage been analysed. To carry out this analysis, up to a total of 28 magnitude-damage functions (with different characteristics and application scales) were selected on which the effect of over-elevation and under-elevation of the main floor of the houses was simulated (at intervals of 20 cm, between -0.6 and +1 m). According to each of the two trends, an overestimation or underestimation of flood damage was observed. This pattern was conditioned by the specific characteristics of each magnitude-damage function, meaning that the percentage of damage became asymptotic from a certain flow depth value. In a real scenario, the consideration of this variable (as opposed to its non-consideration) causes an average variation in the damage estimation around 30%. Based on these results, the analysed variable can be considered as (1) another main source of uncertainty in the correct estimation of flood damage, and (2) an essential variable to take into account in a flood damage analysis for the correct estimation of loss. floods  economic damage  building first floor  magnitude-damage models  Navaluenga RASTER-BASED MODEL  MANAGEMENT  DAMAGE  INUNDATION  ELEMENT  AREAS",On the Influence of the Main Floor Layout of Buildings in Economic Flood Risk Assessment: Results from Central Spain,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07522542781205321,0.08045395746452688,0.03608539197438346,0.0612767636388439,Empirical
15639,"ANN based methodology for active control of buildings for seismic excitation for different seismic zones of India In the last two decades, many studies are reported in literature for determining the control force for the active control systems for damage mitigation of buildings due to earthquake. However, no study has been reported for prediction of control force considering the seismic zones in India. In the present study, spectrum compatible time histories are generated for the seismic zones IV and V as per Indian standard IS 1893(Part 1):2002 design spectrum. Time history analysis are carried out with spectrum compatible time histories for shear type buildings modelled as multi-degree of freedom system (MDOF) with a computer program developed in MATLAB by modal superposition using Newmark-beta method. Control forces are obtained by adopting algorithm proposed in literature and input and output patterns are generated for development of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models in Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator (SNNS). In the present study the methodology is demonstrated with five storey building by developing 24 ANN models consisting of two ANN architectures viz., NET1 and NET2 for each seismic zone and three soil types.

20471,"Seismic damage state predictions of reinforced concrete structures using stacked long short-term memory neural networks Early and accurate damage evaluation after earthquakes is critical for planning an efficient and timely emergency response. State-of-the-art rapid evaluation techniques of structural damage include the use of fragility or vulnerability curves. However, fragility-based damage functions may vary significantly, depending on the ground motion characteristics, soil conditions, and structural geometric properties. A novel stacked long short-term memory (LSTM) network with overlapping data was developed in this study to overcome this issue. The ground motion time histories are divided into several stacks and feed to the LSTM network, and the data are overlapped with the preceding stack to link each stack. The stacked LSTM reduces the temporal dimension by stacking and generating new features, and shortens the time required for training. The proposed network significantly reduces the training time required (approximately 97%) and enhances the test accuracies (80%–95%) as the number of stacks increases. OpenSees is utilized for the creation of the numerical model of ductile frames (using concentrated plasticity modeling approach) and nonductile frames (using distributed plasticity modeling approach). Although these structures have different response mechanisms, the proposed LSTM network shows the diversity in predicting the earthquake-induced damage with a high degree of accuracy (80%–95%). The performance of the proposed model on different types of structures (nonductile and ductile building frames and a non-ductile bridge) with the same network shows the flexibility of the model.

19676,"Probabilistic Approach to the Seismic Vulnerability of Reinforced Concrete Frame Structures by the Development of Analytical Fragility Curves Fragility curves are very useful in quantifying the physical and economic damage of buildings that have undergone an earthquake. This paper presents the development of analytical fragility curves representative of mid-rise residential structures built with reinforced concrete, taking into account the specific structural characteristics of Algerian buildings. The derivation of the analytical fragility curves is based on the capacity spectrum method (CSM), which combines a non-linear static analysis (pushover) with a response spectrum analysis. Observation of the consequences of earthquakes of a given intensity shows that the damage to buildings is not identical, even though their construction is similar. This variability of damage can be explained by the variability of a large number of factors such as the local intensity of the hazard, the heterogeneity of the terrain, and the mechanical and geometrical characteristics of the constructions. The materials and patterns of demand spectra were considered as random variables using the Latin Hypercube Sampling Technique. Most of the existing methods that model the damage to structures accept a log-normal distribution hypothesis, where the log-normal law is a model controlled by two parameters: its mean value and its standard deviation. To set these parameters, Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) are performed to generate 1000 samples. The resulting fragility curves following these analyses were applied to two real-life cases of buildings affected by the earthquake of Beni-Ilmane 2010 (Msila, Algeria), so as to assess the damage.

17270,"Effects of eccentric steel bracing systems on seismic fragility curves of mid-rise R/C buildings: A case study In this study, the seismic reliability of a mid-rise reinforced concrete (R/C) building retrofitted using eccentric steel braces is investigated through fragility analysis. As a case study, a six storey mid-rise R/C building was selected. The design of selected sample building was made with reference to 1975 version of the Turkish Seismic Code. The effectiveness of using different types of eccentric steel braces in retrofitting the building was examined. The effect of distributing the steel bracing over the height of the R/C frame on the seismic performance of the retrofitted building was studied. For the strengthening of the original structure, D, K, and V type eccentric bracing systems were utilized and each of these bracing systems was applied with four different spatial distributions in the structure. For fragility analysis, the study employed a set of 200 generated earthquake acceleration records compatible with the elastic code design spectrum. Nonlinear time history analysis was used to analyze the structures subjected to this set of earthquake accelerations generated in terms of peak ground accelerations (PGA), whilst monitoring four performance limit states. The fragility curves were developed in terms of PGA for these limit states; namely: slight, moderate, major, and collapse with lognormal distribution assumption. The improvement of seismic reliability achieved through the use of D, K, and V type eccentric braces was evaluated by comparing the median values of the fragility curves of the existing building before and after retrofits. As a result of this study, the improvement in seismic performance of this type of mid-rise R/C building resulting from retrofits by different types of eccentric steel braces was obtained by formulation of the fragility reduction. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

16079,"Capacity related properties of RC frame buildings in Turkey The capacity curves of various structural systems that are used in the HAZUS methodology to determine seismic vulnerability were developed based on the seismic design codes. These capacity curves are, therefore, very idealistic and do not take into account variations in the regional design practice. This article presents the results of nonlinear static analyses of representative reinforced concrete frame buildings located in Turkey to obtain their capacity curves. A representative set of buildings was selected from existing RC buildings. The parameters such as yield over-strength ratio, fundamental period, post elastic stiffness, yield and ultimate drift ratios, and yield base shear coefficient have been obtained from the idealized capacity curves. These parameters are used in HAZUS to determine seismic response of buildings under a given hazard level. This seismic response is then used in predetermined fragility curves to estimate the expected loss for the particular building type.

19946,"Rapid risk evaluation (ER2) using ms excel spreadsheet: A case study of fredericton (New Brunswick, Canada) Conventional knowledge of the flood hazard alone (extent and frequency) is not sufficient for informed decision-making. The public safety community needs tools and guidance to adequately undertake flood hazard risk assessment in order to estimate respective damages and social and economic losses. While many complex computer models have been developed for flood risk assessment, they require highly trained personnel to prepare the necessary input (hazard, inventory of the built environment, and vulnerabilities) and analyze model outputs. As such, tools which utilize open-source software or are built within popular desktop software programs are appealing alternatives. The recently developed Rapid Risk Evaluation (ER2) application runs scenario based loss assessment analyses in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. User input is limited to a handful of intuitive drop-down menus utilized to describe the building type, age, occupancy and the expected water level. In anticipation of local depth damage curves and other needed vulnerability parameters, those from the U.S. FEMA’s Hazus-Flood software have been imported and temporarily accessed in conjunction with user input to display exposure and estimated economic losses related to the structure and the content of the building. Building types and occupancies representative of those most exposed to flooding in Fredericton (New Brunswick) were introduced and test flood scenarios were run.

15009,"13 - Assessing the seismic vulnerability of masonry buildings Abstract: Masonry structures represent the highest proportion of the building stock worldwide and in regions affected by destructive seismicity. Together with reinforced concrete buildings they account for the largest proportion of casualties in earthquakes. However, well-built masonry buildings have survived for centuries, even in regions of high seismicity. In the past, seismic vulnerability assessment of masonry structures has been conducted using empirical methods, based on post-event collection of damage data. This approach does not allow easy correlation of structural behaviour with observed damage and quantification of the effect of seismic strengthening on seismic resistance. After an initial review of the main issues associated with the seismic vulnerability assessment of masonry buildings, the chapter presents the rationale and algorithm of a procedure based on limit state analysis and collapse mechanisms (FaMIVE), to derive capacity curves for masonry structures. It is shown how the procedure can be used to derive vulnerability and fragility functions following the methodology of the capacity spectrum method and the performance-based assessment method.

17956,"Fragility and vulnerability analysis of an RC building with the application of nonlinear analysis In this paper, the seismic response of a five-story reinforced concrete (RC) frame system building is analysed through fragility analysis. The structure is designed in accordance with structural Eurocodes EN1990, EN1991, EN1992 and EN1998, as a high-ductility (DCH) system. For the analysis of the response of a structural system to earthquake actions, the methods of nonlinear static (NSA) and nonlinear dynamic analyses (NDA) are applied and, based on the obtained results, fragility curves are constructed using statistical methods. A relationship between the intensity measure (IM) and engineering demand parameters (EDPs) is needed in order to estimate a fragility curve. Fragility functions represent a possibility for different states of damage to occur in a certain structural systems at the observed value of the specified IM. Ten accelerograms, used in NDA, are selected and scaled, according to EN1998 provisions, for the chosen elastic response spectrum and referent PGA. Obtained results are used for the statistical analysis and construction of fragility curves. Structural damage state threshold parameters are determined based on the Park and Ang modified damage index methodology and provisions given in FEMA, HAZUS, VISION 2000 and EN codes. Comparative analysis of the structural damage probability for the analysed RC building, calculated using different methodologies to determine damage states, is applied. The fragility analysis results showed the difference between the probabilities of the damage states to occur when different calculation methods are used. This reflects on the assessment of vulnerability curves as well. The obtained results, calculated using different methods, are analysed using comparative analysis. © 2021 by the authors.

20547,"Seismic fragility analysis of conventional and viscoelastically damped moment resisting frames This paper presents the results of an analytical study on seismic reliability of viscoelastically damped frame systems in comparison with that of conventional moment resisting frame systems. In order to exhibit the reliability of the frame systems with viscoelastic dampers, seismic reliability analyses were carried out for steel framed buildings, 5 and 12 storeys in height, designed as: (a) Case 1: Conventional moment resisting frame, (b) Case 2: Frame with viscoelastic dampers providing supplemental effective damping ratio of 10%, and (c) Case 3: Frame with viscoelastic dampers providing supplemental effective damping ratio of 20%. Nonlinear time history analyses were utilized to develop seismic fragility curves whilst monitoring various performance objectives. To obtain robust estimators of the seismic reliability, a database including 15 natural earthquake ground motion records with markedly different characteristics was employed in the fragility analysis. The results indicate that depending upon the supplemental effective damping ratio, frames designed with viscoelastic dampers have considerably lower annual probability of exceedance of performance limit states for structural components, showing up to a five-fold reduction in comparison to conventionally designed moment resisting frame system. © 2014 Techno-Press, Ltd.

18055,"Fragility Curves of Restoration Processes for Resilience Analysis In literature the fragility curves are usually adopted to evaluate the probability of exceedance of a given damage state. This chapter presents for the first time a procedure for developing fragility curves of restoration processes which can be adopted for resilience analysis. The restoration process describes the capacity to recover from a system failure and it is one of the most uncertain variables in the resilience analysis therefore, the problem should be treated in probabilistic terms. In the chapter, a method is proposed for evaluating the Restoration Fragility Functions (RFF) of a given system following an extreme event. The restoration curves have been built empirically using the data obtained by a discrete event simulation model of the system considered. Different restoration processes obtained through Monte Carlo simulations have been analyzed statistically to determine the probability of exceedance of a given restoration state. Then, Restoration Fragility Functions (RFF) are obtained using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) approach assuming a lognormal cumulative distribution function. The method has been applied to an Emergency Department of a hospital during a crisis, because these buildings are critical facilities which should withstand after an earthquake in order to assist injuries.

This article includes a holistic methodology to account for nonlinear soil behavior and soil–foundation–structure interaction in a modular way. Using nonlinear dynamic analyses, we derive fragility curves for a wide set of building typologies and soil profiles, showing that soil behavior during strong shaking significantly affects the vulnerability of the soil–foundation–structure system.

20599,"Seismic fragility analysis of URM buildings founded on piles: influence of dynamic soil–structure interaction models The impact of adopting different dynamic soil–structure interaction (SSI) models on the assessment of seismic fragility functions for buildings with pile foundations is studied herein. Given the importance on seismic response of the coupling of structure, foundation and soil, and the challenges posed on modelling dynamic SSI, especially when soil nonlinearity plays a significant role, the linear substructure approach is initially adopted by implementing two different models, followed by the use of a nonlinear pile-head macro-element. The first model is one-dimensional and includes, between the foundation node and the ground, only a translational elastic spring and a dashpot, whose stiffness and viscous damping are retrieved from the real and imaginary parts of the dynamic impedance at the first natural frequency of the structure. The second and more refined model is a Lumped-Parameter Model accounting for frequency dependence of the coupled horizontal and rotational impedances in a two-dimensional response. A nonlinear pile-head macro-element model is introduced afterwards to explore the sensitivity of fragility functions to the linearity assumption. This approach models the soil nonlinear behaviour at near-field, as well as the far-field dynamic impedance and energy dissipation through radiation damping, by condensing the entire soil-foundation system into a single nonlinear element at the base of the superstructure. In all models, the superstructure is represented in a simplified way as a nonlinear single-degree-of-freedom system. The comparison between the adopted approaches is evaluated in terms of their effects on the characterisation of fragility functions for unreinforced masonry buildings with pile foundations. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

12549,"A Review of Flood Loss Models as Basis for Harmonization and Benchmarking Risk-based approaches have been increasingly accepted and operationalized in flood risk management during recent decades. For instance, commercial flood risk models are used by the insurance industry to assess potential losses, establish the pricing of policies and determine reinsurance needs. Despite considerable progress in the development of loss estimation tools since the 1980s, loss estimates still reflect high uncertainties and disparities that often lead to questioning their quality. This requires an assessment of the validity and robustness of loss models as it affects prioritization and investment decision in flood risk management as well as regulatory requirements and business decisions in the insurance industry. Hence, more effort is needed to quantify uncertainties and undertake validations. Due to a lack of detailed and reliable flood loss data, first order validations are difficult to accomplish, so that model comparisons in terms of benchmarking are essential. It is checked if the models are informed by existing data and knowledge and if the assumptions made in the models are aligned with the existing knowledge. When this alignment is confirmed through validation or benchmarking exercises, the user gains confidence in the models. Before these benchmarking exercises are feasible, however, a cohesive survey of existing knowledge needs to be undertaken. With that aim, this work presents a review of flood loss-or flood vulnerability-relationships collected from the public domain and some professional sources. Our survey analyses 61 sources consisting of publications or software packages, of which 47 are reviewed in detail. This exercise results in probably the most complete review of flood loss models to date containing nearly a thousand vulnerability functions. These functions are highly heterogeneous and only about half of the loss models are found to be accompanied by explicit validation at the time of their proposal. This paper exemplarily presents an approach for a quantitative comparison of disparate models via the reduction to the joint input variables of all models. Harmonization of models for benchmarking and comparison requires profound insight into the model structures, mechanisms and underlying assumptions. Possibilities and challenges are discussed that exist in model harmonization and the application of the inventory in a benchmarking framework.

17929,"Fragility analysis of steel moment-resisting frames subjected to impact actions In recent decades, researchers have been examining the behavior of structures subjected to abnormal loadings such as fire, blast, and vehicle collision. Extreme actions like the impact force of light and heavy vehicles on the external column of steel buildings, whether accidentally or purposely, are an essential research topic among the many impact loading scenarios. Since the impact loads induced by vehicle collisions on external building columns are rarely considered in the design procedure, so, the effect of these loads on the nonlinear performance of structures needs to be investigated thoroughly by using nonlinear dynamic time history analyses and fragility curves. In this study, 2D steel moment-resisting frames (SMRFs) with 2, 5, 8, and 12-story with an intermediate ductility are designed for gravity and seismic loads. Then, nonlinear dynamic time history analyses are performed using OpenSees software under the impact loads induced by light and heavy vehicles collisions with corner column of mentioned frames. Next, Fragility curves are proposed based on the various damage levels for interpretation of probabilities. The results of the probabilistic analyses showed that among the studied frames, mid-rise 8-story frame had more collapse capacity and low-rise 2-story frame had less collapse capacity against vehicle impact. For example, the average collapse velocity for low, medium, and severe damage levels of a 2-story frame is equivalent to 27, 37 and 69 km/h under the impact of a light vehicle collision, respectively. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

16274,"Comparison of Damage Values Used in Different Flood Modelling Studies Estimating the economic loss caused by a flood hazard plays a major role in decision making during disaster risk reduction activities, and such studies have been carried over some major cities of the world. This paper compares the base economic values used for building and infrastructure, depth-damage curves used and the total economic loss caused by flood hazards in five such studies carried out in Colombo, Jakarta, Manila, Bangkok and Ginosa. These original studies had the data on different formats which were adopted to this study by means of normalization. The building structural damage and the contents damage of residential, commercial and industrial building types were focused on, since the largest contributions to the direct damage arises from these categories and building types. The comparisons have shown the importance of having disaggregated building economic information for commercial and industrial buildings with similar damage curves for the same building category. Furthermore, the importance of choosing a conservative depth for flood studies is stressed. The maximum inundation depth for the studies vary from 1.8 m to 10.0 m; and the lower values may produce errors in quantifying economic losses for floods with higher return periods. © 2019 IEEE. content damage  damage curve comparison  economic value per area  structural damage Engineering research  Floods  Hazards  Losses  Office buildings  Risk perception  Building structural  content damage  Damage curves  Disaster risk reductions  Economic information  Economic values  Industrial buildings  Structural damages  Structural analysis",Comparison of Damage Values Used in Different Flood Modelling Studies,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09654268517835686,0.05841290585116231,0.1686229374570694,0.0027887546130890913,Hybrid
15209,"A Multilevel Procedure at Urban Scale to Assess the Vulnerability and the Exposure of Residential Masonry Buildings: The Case Study of Pordenone, Northeast Italy More than the 60% of the Italian residential building stock had already been built by 1974, when seismic codes were enforced on a minimal part of the country. Unreinforced masonry buildings represent most of that share, but they are typical for each region, in terms of both materials and structural configurations. The definition of 'regional', i.e., more specific, vulnerability and exposure models are required to improve existing forecast models. The research presents a new geographic information system (GIS)-based multilevel procedure for earthquake disaster prevention planning at urban scale; it includes multicriteria analysis, such as architectural types, structural vulnerability analysis, microzonation studies, and socio-economic aspects. The procedure has been applied to the municipality of Pordenone (PN), a district town of the Friuli-Venezia-Giulia region, in Northeast Italy. To assess the urban seismic risk, more than 5000 masonry residential buildings were investigated and common types within sub-municipal areas and exposure data were collected. Simplified mechanical analysis provided a 'regional' vulnerability model through typological fragility curves. The integration of results into GIS tool permitted the definition of cross-mapping among vulnerability, damage scenarios (conditional and unconditional) and exposure (seismic losses, casualties, impact), with respect to various earthquake intensities expected in the town.

17542,"Evaluation of the habitability of buildings affected by an earthquake using the fuzzy sets theory and the artificial neural networks The fuzzy sets theory and the artificial neural networks are computational intelligence tools which are nowadays widely used in earthquake engineering. This paper develops a method and a computer program which use these computational intelligence tools in order to support the damage and safety evaluation of buildings after strong earthquakes. The model uses an artificial neural network with three layers and a Kohonen learning algorithm; it also uses fuzzy sets in order to manage subjective information such as linguistic qualification of the damage levels in buildings and a fuzzy rule base to support the decision making process. All these techniques are incorporated in the developed computer program. The input data is the subjective and incomplete information about the building state obtained by possibly non experienced evaluators in the field of the seismic performance of buildings. The proposed method is implemented in a tool especially useful in the emergency response phase, when it supports the decision making regarding the building habitability and reparability. In order to show its effectiveness, two examples are included for two different types of buildings. (C) 2010 CIMNE (UPC). Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L. All rights reserved.

16247,"Comparative flood damage model assessment: towards a European approach There is a wide variety of flood damage models in use internationally, differing substantially in their approaches and economic estimates. Since these models are being used more and more as a basis for investment and planning decisions on an increasingly large scale, there is a need to reduce the uncertainties involved and develop a harmonised European approach, in particular with respect to the EU Flood Risks Directive. In this paper we present a qualitative and quantitative assessment of seven flood damage models, using two case studies of past flood events in Germany and the United Kingdom. The qualitative analysis shows that modelling approaches vary strongly, and that current methodologies for estimating infrastructural damage are not as well developed as methodologies for the estimation of damage to buildings. The quantitative results show that the model outcomes are very sensitive to uncertainty in both vulnerability (i.e. depth-damage functions) and exposure (i.e. asset values), whereby the first has a larger effect than the latter. We conclude that care needs to be taken when using aggregated land use data for flood risk assessment, and that it is essential to adjust asset values to the regional economic situation and property characteristics. We call for the development of a flexible but consistent European framework that applies best practice from existing models while providing room for including necessary regional adjustments.

21304,"Sequential learning artificial fuzzy neural networks (SLAFNN) with single hidden layer In this paper, a sequential orthogonal approach to the building and training of a single hidden layer fuzzy neural network is presented. Sequential learning artificial neural network model proposed by Zhang and Morris (Neural Networks 11 (1) (1998) 65) is modified to tackle fuzzy inputs and crisp outputs and a sequential learning artificial fuzzy neural network model is developed and used in this paper. This model can tackle the common problem encountered by conventional fuzzy back propagation neural network in the determination of the network structure in the number of hidden layers and the number of hidden neurons in each layer. Non-linear mapping between fuzzy input vectors and crisp output is performed. Left and right (LR) type representation is used to reduce the network complexity. A simple defuzzification process is proposed. The procedure starts with a single hidden neuron and sequentially increases in the number of hidden neurons until the model error is sufficiently small. The classical Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization method is used at each step to form a set of orthogonal bases for the space spanned by output vectors of the hidden neurons. In this approach it is possible to determine the necessary number of hidden neurons required. The fuzzy neural network architecture has been trained and tested to civil engineering problems such as determination of allowable stress limits for a beam subjected to lateral loads, earthquake damage and the evaluation of wind pressure predictions.

16884,"Development of building vulnerability functions in subsidence regions from empirical methods The extraction of ores and minerals by underground mining often causes ground subsidence phenomena. In urban regions, these phenomena may induce small to severe damage to buildings. To evaluate this damage, several empirical and analytical methods have been developed in different countries. However, these methods are difficult to use and compare due to differences in the number of criteria used (from 1 to 12). Furthermore, the results provided by damage evaluation may be significantly different from one method to another. The present paper develops vulnerability functions based on a concept that has been applied in other areas, such as earthquake engineering, and that appears to be a more efficient way to assess building vulnerability in undermined cities. A methodology is described for calculating vulnerability functions in subsidence zones using empirical methods. The first part of the paper focuses on existing empirical methods for damage evaluation, and selected necessary improvements or modifications are justified. The second part focuses on the development of a building typology in subsidence zones and its application in the Lorraine region, where many villages are subject to subsidence problems due to iron-ore mining. The third section describes and discusses the adopted methodology for determining vulnerability and fragility functions or curves. Finally, vulnerability functions are tested and validated with a set of three subsidences that occurred in Lorraine between 1996 and 1999. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

17845,"Flood damage functions based on a single physics- and data-based impact parameter that jointly accounts for water depth and velocity Direct flood damage is commonly assessed using damage models (i.e., vulnerability functions and fragility curves), which describe the relationship between hazard, vulnerability, and the (probability of) damage for items exposed to floods. In this paper, we introduce a non-dimensional impact parameter that, according to the physics of damage mechanisms and/or tuned on field or lab data, combines water depth and flow velocity in a general and flexible form. We then suggest a general approach to assess relative damage functions for items of different nature, subject to either progressive or on–off damage processes. The proposed method enhances traditional tools that use inundation depth as the main (or only) explicative variable, and allows recasting the results from previous studies in an elegant, flexible and unique form. Compared to multivariate models that link flow variables to damage directly, the physics-based approach allows for an intelligible assessment of flood hazard and the associated damage, even in case of scarce or sparse data. The proposed impact parameter and the related procedure to assess the relative damage functions are applied to different kinds of exposed items (people, vehicles, and buildings), demonstrating the general applicability and validity of the proposed method. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

22242,"Vulnerability assessment of low-code reinforced concrete frame buildings subjected to liquefaction-induced differential displacements While liquefaction has been widely recognized as being one of the principal earthquake hazards resulting to significant economic and societal losses, research in the vulnerability assessment and quantitative evaluation of the expected physical damages to building structures is rather limited. In this respect, this study aims at the vulnerability assessment of typical low-code reinforced concrete (RC) frame buildings of various heights with shallow flexible foundations subjected to differential permanent displacements due to liquefaction. Nonlinear static analyses are carried out for each considered structural typology assuming different gradually increasing differential displacement patterns applied as quasi-static loads directly at its supports (footings). Different damage mechanisms are examined including a flexural damage of the building members and a shear failure of the columns. The proposed methodology results to the development of lognormally distributed fragility curves for different structural damage states as a function of the liquefaction induced differential displacements. It is shown that the height of the structure as well as the existence or not of a horizontal component of the differential displacements represent key factors affecting the vulnerability assessment. Vulnerability curves are also constructed to assess the expected direct losses in normalised cost terms. The whole approach is illustrated through a specific example. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd Damage index  Fragility curves  Liquefaction-induced differential displacements  Nonlinear static analysis  Reinforced concrete buildings Concrete buildings  Failure (mechanical)  Liquefaction  Reinforced concrete  Static analysis  Structural analysis  Damage index  Differential displacements  Fragility curves  Non-linear static analysis  Quantitative evaluation  Reinforced concrete frame buildings  Reinforced concrete frames  Vulnerability assessments  Damage detection  assessment method  damage mechanics  displacement  induced response  liquefaction  reinforced concrete  seismic hazard  static response  structural component  vulnerability",Vulnerability assessment of low-code reinforced concrete frame buildings subjected to liquefaction-induced differential displacements,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.319808559132063,0.025093785938672907,0.027454481160527226,0.0060906608417758395,Analytical
17015,"Drift-sensitive non-structural damage to masonry-infilled reinforced concrete frames designed to Eurocode 8 Post-earthquake surveys indicate that losses come from non-structural damage more than from structural damage. Current performance-based design would prevent excessive non-structural damage as well, but the effectiveness of relevant code provisions has not been assessed in depth. This study investigates the drift-sensitive non-structural damage to reinforced concrete frame buildings complying with the European seismic code. Damage to non-structural unreinforced masonry infill walls in contact with the frame is quantified in terms of numerical fragility curves with the same quantities considered in the design: the peak ground acceleration measures the seismic intensity; the peak value of the interstorey drift ratio is the damage index. The methodology for the fragility computation is described in detail. Peculiar is the use of probabilistic parameters of the drift capacity coupled to the fuzziness in the damage state. The drift demand is estimated by member-by-member modelling of typical frame structures and non-linear time-history analyses under spectrum-compatible artificial accelerograms. The kind of the infills and their modelling, the number of storeys, the ground type, and the ductility class are covered. Modelling the infills results to be essential. Any code-compliant verification is on the safe side, but the margin appears to be inconsistent among the frames under consideration. Furthermore, there is one case where occupancy appears to be not ensured despite the code verification is satisfied. The effect of the number of storeys may be misrepresented. The ductility class may be unimportant, however the damage seems to be correlated with the likely strength. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

19838,"Propagating fragility curve for rc buildings via hazus methodology In this era where sustainability plays a key role, to design structures for resisting the earthquake in best probable manner is an inspiration for all designers. The recent trend for structural engineers is evolving in the direction of NSA (Nonlinear Static Analysis) in order to generate its ultimate building capacity. Frame structures are evaluated using NSA i.e. push-over analysis to interpret the phenomenon of plastic yielding being experienced within the structure. ATC-40 has well illustrated various performance levels of the buildings. When seismic loads are active due to shaking of ground, it is essential to assess the conditional probability of structural response. This can be done using conditional probability as a function and plotting fragility curves for structural response due to application of seismic activity or loading as a function. These fragility curves are useful not only for calamities before earthquake but also after earthquake to evaluate the seismic losses. The probability of whichever damage state being exceeded can be plotted using fragility curves which can be derived using empirical or analytical methods which rely on both the source of the data along with type of analysis. This paper addresses the analytical method using the guidelines given by the HAZUS MH technical manual. The work represented here is compiled by means of procedure for establishing the fragility curves for three typical Reinforced Concrete (RC) frame structures having variations resembling 3 storey intended for short-period structures, 6 storey used for medium-period structures and 12 storey representing long-period structures. For analyzing structures, FEM based software SAP2000 has been used as a tool. The present study contributes towards quantification of seismic fragility; henceforth fragility curves are co-related and plotted which provides a rational and consistent probabilistic treatment of damage or loss.

12573,"An empirical method for seismic vulnerability assessment of Nepali school buildings The 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal damaged more than 28,000 school buildings across the affected areas. Nepali school buildings can broadly be categorized into special moment-resisting frame, brick masonry, stone masonry, timber, and composite construction (steel and masonry). This paper proposes a new methodology to designate seismic vulnerability of these building categories. The proposed methodology is based on the field study of around 3389 school buildings in central Nepal. Structural, non-structural, architectural, site conditions, seismic enhancement and retrofitting, and multi-hazard parameters are incorporated to develop a scoring system. Indexed based system is introduced using sensitivity analysis which allows the designation of total vulnerability scores to individual buildings. The scores are modified based on the level of seismic strengthening/retrofitting. Based on the total vulnerability score, a qualitative vulnerability level is assigned to the individual building. The results highlight that more than 90% of Nepali school buildings are moderate to very highly vulnerable.

17811,"Fire Fragility Functions for Steel Frame Buildings: Sensitivity Analysis and Reliability Framework Fire fragility functions are a powerful method to characterize the probabilistic vulnerability of buildings to fire in the context of urban resilience assessment. But this method is recent and the influence of the different uncertain parameters on the functions has not been systematically studied. The first objective of this paper is to identify the prevailing parameters in constructing fire fragility functions for steel frame buildings. To this end, sensitivity analyses are conducted using Monte Carlo Simulations and a variance-based method, focusing on column failure fragilities. Fragilities for buildings with 3 to 12 stories, 0 to 3 h fire resistance rating and various occupancies are compared, assuming compartment areas ranging from 15 m2 to 80 m2. Results show that uncertainties in fire, heat transfer and structural models all generate significant variability in the fire fragility. In addition to fire load as the intensity measure, significant probabilistic parameters are the compartment geometry and openings, the thickness and thermal conductivity of fire protection, and the temperature dependent mechanical properties of steel. The second objective is to clarify the incorporation of fragility functions in a comprehensive structural fire reliability framework. A methodology for combining the functions with the ignition likelihood per year and with the fire loading in MJ/m2 is described, yielding annual probability estimates of column failure due to fire in the buildings. For a sprinklered office building designed according to prescriptive provisions, this annual probability ranges from 1.90 × 10−7 to 0.12 × 10−7 per year as a function of the building height. The probabilistic modeling techniques proposed in this paper can be used to establish consistent reliability levels in different buildings and to evaluate resilience for fire scenarios. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

However, there have been few seismic vulnerability studies on high-rise buildings, and few fragility curves have been developed for the buildings. Based on the published data of more than 50 high rises and super high rises, the structural information such as building heights, mode periods, locations and sites, the maximum design story drift ratios, are collected and analyzed. The vulnerability analysis for high rises uses response spectrum displacement as seismic ground motion input, since the structures have comparatively long natural period. Using statistics and regression analysis, the relationship between the maximum story drift ratio and response spectrum displacement is established. Based on height groups and earthquake design codes, the fragility curves of different performance levels can be developed.

Four ultimate damage states for entire structure and interstory are defined, and based on which, a method for solving the limit values of the four performance levels is put forward. Seismic fragility analysis is carried out for two different concrete-filled square tubular (CFST) frames, and fragility curves are derived to assess and compare the seismic performances of the two structures.

21952,"Towards a Sensitivity Analysis in Seismic Risk with Probabilistic Building Exposure Models: An Application in Valparaiso, Chile Using Ancillary Open-Source Data and Parametric Ground Motions Efforts have been made in the past to enhance building exposure models on a regional scale with increasing spatial resolutions by integrating different data sources. This work follows a similar path and focuses on the downscaling of the existing SARA exposure model that was proposed for the residential building stock of the communes of Valparaiso and Vina del Mar (Chile). Although this model allowed great progress in harmonising building classes and characterising their differential physical vulnerabilities, it is now outdated, and in any case, it is spatially aggregated over large administrative units. Hence, to more accurately consider the impact of future earthquakes on these cities, it is necessary to employ more reliable exposure models. For such a purpose, we propose updating this existing model through a Bayesian approach by integrating ancillary data that has been made increasingly available from Volunteering Geo-Information (VGI) activities. Its spatial representation is also optimised in higher resolution aggregation units that avoid the inconvenience of having incomplete building-by-building footprints. A worst-case earthquake scenario is presented to calculate direct economic losses and highlight the degree of uncertainty imposed by exposure models in comparison with other parameters used to generate the seismic ground motions within a sensitivity analysis. This example study shows the great potential of using increasingly available VGI to update worldwide building exposure models as well as its importance in scenario-based seismic risk assessment. exposure  buildings  Bayesian model  downscaling  OpenStreetMap  ground motion fields  sensitivity  earthquake  vulnerability  risk EARTHQUAKE LOSS ESTIMATION  VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT  SPECTRAL ACCELERATIONS  DAMAGE ASSESSMENT  DATA SETS  HAZARD  UNCERTAINTY  INVENTORY  OPENSTREETMAP  ENVIRONMENTS","Towards a Sensitivity Analysis in Seismic Risk with Probabilistic Building Exposure Models: An Application in Valparaiso, Chile Using Ancillary Open-Source Data and Parametric Ground Motions",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19473849745603988,0.018322363664927243,0.1565632544345826,0.03771258800709834,Analytical
15136,"A framework for the probabilistic quantification of the resilience of communities to hurricane winds Enhancing community resilience against hurricanes, one of the costliest natural hazards to impact the United States over the past four decades, is an essential requirement for the nation’s security and welfare. A fundamental step in this direction is to provide computational frameworks that are able to quantify the response of the community to the hazard immediately after its impact and during its recovery process. Existing frameworks focus on estimating damage and losses immediately subsequent to the hurricane impact through vulnerability models. This paper provides a framework that integrates damage estimated from vulnerability models with a probabilistic recovery model for quantifying community resilience against hurricanes. The framework is based on five resilience limit states that identify the required recovery activities for each building based on the amount of damage. A building-level recovery model, based on discrete functionality states, translates these limit states to a building-level recovery function. By aggregating building recovery functions, a community recovery function and resilience measure are obtained. The framework is embedded in a Monte Carlo simulation strategy for uncertainty propagation therefore enabling a fully probabilistic quantification of community resilience. The framework is illustrated with a case study consisting of a typical residential neighborhood in Miami, FL.

20503,"Seismic displacement demand estimation for fragility assessment of reinforced concrete frame buildings Seismic risk assessment at regional scales involves seismic hazard, inventory of assets at risk and respective vulnerability. Vulnerability refers to the susceptibility to earthquake impacts defined by the potential physical damages and resulting economic and social losses. Central to the vulnerability modelling is the concept of fragility function that correlates the expected structural damage to increasing levels of seismic intensity. Fragility functions combine a probabilistic seismic demand model and a probabilistic damage model. The probabilistic seismic demand model correlates a seismic intensity measure (IM) such as the spectral acceleration at the fundamental period of the building, Sa(Ti), to an engineering demand parameter (EDP) that better correlates with damage such as the maximum inter-story drift. The probabilistic damage model correlates the EDP to threshold damage states (e.g. slight, moderate, extensive, and complete). This paper presents the development of a new simplified probabilistic seismic demand model applicable for fragility analysis of ductile medium and high rise reinforced concrete moment resisting frame buildings (RC-MRF) for regional seismic risk studies. The model provides a direct correlation between the maximum inter-story drift to the Sa(Ti) using a new period dependent displacement coefficient. A database was compiled from literature sources of maximum inter-story drift seismic demand predictions using nonlinear finite element models for ductile RC-MRF that were subjected to increasing levels of ground motion intensities. The model was applied to develop fragility functions for a case study ductile 16-story high-rise RC-MRF building that conforms to the provisions of the 2005 National Building Code of Canada and estimate probable damage for 2% and 10% probability of exceedance in 50 years. © 2017Canadian Society for Civil Engineering.

18050,"Fragility curves of non-ductile RC frame buildings on saturated soils including liquefaction effects and soil-structure interaction Liquefaction constitutes the most common source of seismic damage to buildings resting on saturated soils. Soil-structure interaction (SSI) may also significantly affect the seismic response of structures, modifying their dynamic characteristics and the seismic response at the foundation level. Although progress has been made on the investigation of the influence of soil liquefaction and SSI on the structural response, studies combining both phenomena are very limited. To bridge this gap, we investigate the integrated influence of both liquefaction and SSI on the seismic response and vulnerability of low-code reinforced concrete (RC) moment resisting frame buildings. A two-storey non-ductile RC frame building is adopted as reference. The following numerical models are developed: (1) a fixed-base structure subjected to free-field (FF) motion neglecting liquefaction (and SSI); (2) a fixed-base structure subjected to FF motion allowing liquefaction; (3) a flexible-base structure (i.e. including SSI) resting on soil subjected to outcrop bedrock motion neglecting liquefaction; (4) a flexible-base structure resting on soil subjected to outcrop bedrock motion allowing liquefaction. Conducting nonlinear incremental dynamic analysis for the above-described configurations, we derive seismic fragility curves considering (or not) SSI and/or liquefaction effects for different damage limit states through statistical correlation of the calculated engineering demand parameter with appropriate intensity measures. We also generate vulnerability curves to quantify the expected structural losses. Results show the substantive role of liquefaction and SSI in altering the seismic fragility and vulnerability of non-ductile low-rise RC frame buildings.

17329,"Empirical Approach to Evaluating the Tornado Fragility of Residential Structures Tornado-induced wind load modeling has advanced significantly in recent years, but comparison of the experimental or numerical models to observed tornado damage is limited. This paper describes the development of empirically derived tornado fragility functions for residential structures following the 22 May 2011 Joplin, Missouri tornado. The fragility functions were created by combining a residential structure damage assessment of the Joplin tornado using the enhanced Fujita (EF) scale and a tornado wind field model conditioned to tree-fall patterns. The damage states for the fragility functions used the degrees of damage (DOD) for one-and two-story residential structures from the EF scale. The empirical tornado fragility functions were compared to analytically derived fragility functions for straightline winds from the FEMA Hazus hurricane model to provide a first attempt at ascertaining how different or similar failure wind speeds are for residential structures under tornado-induced and straightline wind loads. Median failure wind speeds from the empirical tornado fragility functions increased monotonically with DOD, from 33.4 m/s for DOD1 to 85.6 m/s for DOD9. Median failure wind speeds of the empirical tornado fragility functions and Hazus hurricane straightline wind fragility functions differed by 5% or less when suburban terrain was assumed throughout the damage path, and 25% or less when open terrain was assumed. The results suggest that tornado load amplification factors are at worst no more than 55% for residential structures, and may be lower than 10%. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

21183,"Seismic vulnerability assessment of reinforced concrete buildings using Incremental Dynamic Analysis IDA [Evaluation de la vulnérabilité sismique des bâtiments en béton arméen utilisant l'analyse dynamique incrémentale] Incremental dynamic analysis IDA is a non linear dynamic analysis that offers a huge opportunity to evaluate the seismic response of the structure and takes into account the effects of the energy, the duration and the frequency contained in seismic record and product the effect of these parameters as an inter-story drift ratio and maximum displacement in a structure, unlike the PUSHOVER analysis which is a static analysis that provides only an overview of lesser seismic responses on the structure. The occurrence of damage with varying degrees is a random process; therefore, the only appropriate tool to predict the distribution of expected losses would be probabilistic. Therefore we propose to establish fragility curves based on the data of the incremental dynamic analysis to precisely define a sequential pattern of damage and establish a level of structural damage of different seismic intensities of Moroccan real estate.

Three cities with different seismic intensities, Abha, Jazan and Al-Sharaf, were selected to cover various values of mapped spectral accelerations in KSA. The 0.2-s spectral accelerations range from 0.21 to 0.66 g, while the 1.0-s spectral accelerations range from 0.061 to 0.23 g. The structural models were designed under dead, live and seismic loads of these cities according to the Saudi Building Code. Incremental dynamic analysis was performed under 12 ground motions using SeismoStruct.

18032,"Fragility curves for reinforced concrete buildings to seismically triggered slow-moving slides Probabilistic fragility functions have been developed for low-rise, reinforced concrete buildings subjected to earthquake triggered slow-moving slides, applying a recently published methodology by the same authors [5] (Fotopoulou and Pitilakis, 2012). We performed an extensive numerical parametric study considering different idealized slope configurations, soil and geological settings, as well as distances of the structure to the slope's crest and foundation typologies. Various features of the structural damage are explored, highlighting trends on the building's behavior to the permanent co-seismic slope deformations.

13007,"Generation of new fragility curves for common types of buildings in Iran Physical vulnerability of buildings is one of the key parameters needed to assess earthquake risk and to address appropriate disaster management interventions in earthquake prone countries. In order to evaluate this parameter, appropriate fragility functions prepared based on local construction should be applied. However, in Iran reliable fragility curves for different types of buildings have not been developed yet. To address this issue, 19 sets of fragility curves for different types of buildings of Iran were generated in this study, based on empirical approach, incorporated with statistical analysis. Accordingly, at first, different types of common buildings in Iran such as steel frame, reinforced concrete, and masonry buildings were classified into 19 categories. Then, appropriate fragility curves were generated for each class, using existing empirical fragility curves in Iran as well as those proposed for similar types of buildings in other countries. For this purpose, a statistical approach was adopted to weight different curves based on the construction provisions and expert’s judgment. Finally, fragility curves obtained from this study were validated with the observed damages of the previous earthquakes in Iran that shows acceptable compatibility. The proposed approach provides more reliable results for vulnerability assessments in Iran and can be employed in other regions having similar conditions. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

18763,"Low-Probability Flood Risk Modeling for New York City The devastating impact by Hurricane Sandy (2012) again showed New York City (NYC) is one of the most vulnerable cities to coastal flooding around the globe. The low-lying areas in NYC can be flooded by nor'easter storms and North Atlantic hurricanes. The few studies that have estimated potential flood damage for NYC base their damage estimates on only a single, or a few, possible flood events. The objective of this study is to assess the full distribution of hurricane flood risk in NYC. This is done by calculating potential flood damage with a flood damage model that uses many possible storms and surge heights as input. These storms are representative for the low-probability/high-impact flood hazard faced by the city. Exceedance probability-loss curves are constructed under different assumptions about the severity of flood damage. The estimated flood damage to buildings for NYC is between US$59 and 129 millions/year. The damage caused by a 1/100-year storm surge is within a range of US$2 bn-5 bn, while this is between US$5 bn and 11 bn for a 1/500-year storm surge. An analysis of flood risk in each of the five boroughs of NYC finds that Brooklyn and Queens are the most vulnerable to flooding. This study examines several uncertainties in the various steps of the risk analysis, which resulted in variations in flood damage estimations. These uncertainties include: the interpolation of flood depths; the use of different flood damage curves; and the influence of the spectra of characteristics of the simulated hurricanes. © 2013 Society for Risk Analysis.

16856,"Development and validation of simplified mechanics-based capacity curves for scenario-based risk assessment of school buildings in Basel This paper deals with the development of nonlinear static models for the calculation of capacity curves that are subsequently applied in a scenario-based assessment of school buildings. The investigated building types include unreinforced masonry buildings with rigid floors and reinforced concrete buildings with slender shear walls, both of which are typical in central Europe. The curves were established by means of simplified mechanics-based models of the structures together with the expected failure mechanisms of the structural members, from which bilinear capacity curves were calculated. These capacity curves were used to derive fragility curves for a number of predefined earthquake scenarios in Basel, Switzerland. This application revealed that with the initial capacity curves developed in this project, the damage in the earthquake scenarios was largely overestimated compared to that predicted from empirical intensity-based vulnerability models. The initial curves had been determined with models that made use of code recommendations for the assessment of existing structures together with experimental mean material characteristics. Modifications to the modelling procedure, including revised assumptions concerning the failure modes and changes to the assumed initial stiffness based on vibration measurements, led to revised curves which featured, in particular, increased ductility. With these updated and validated capacity curves, results closer to the empirical intensity-based models were obtained. While the type of modelling used herein has its limitations due to simplicity, it was still possible to account for the influence of typical characteristics (such as the detailing of RC walls) on the relative behaviour and response of the buildings, thus justifying the use of analytical capacity and fragility functions, as opposed to empirical intensity-based models, in the final risk assessment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Capacity curves  Displacement-based evaluation  Fragility curves  Mechanical method  Seismic vulnerability assessment Concrete buildings  Earthquakes  Reinforced concrete  Risk assessment  Risk perception  School buildings  Walls (structural partitions)  Capacity curves  Displacement-Based  Fragility curves  Mechanical methods  Seismic vulnerability  Failure (mechanical)  earthquake damage  failure mechanism  floor  masonry  reinforced concrete  risk assessment  stiffness  structural response  Basel  Basel-Stadt  Switzerland",Development and validation of simplified mechanics-based capacity curves for scenario-based risk assessment of school buildings in Basel,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5837261953721607,0.04175225191902065,0.01875916589480753,0.002747169144603179,Analytical
16288,"Comparison of near and far-fault ground motion effects on low and mid-rise masonry buildings This paper presents a comparison of near and far-fault ground motion effects on the seismic response of masonry structures, using nonlinear methods. To compare the influence on low to moderate rise buildings, a detailed field investigation and archive study were executed in Albania. Based on the archive and detailed field investigation over a hundred real residential masonry buildings constructed between 1963-1978, seven masonry buildings of 2-5 stories were selected to reflect the commonly constructed template designs. Analytical models of each building were prepared following the experimental data on the quality of the masonry constitutive components of the selected buildings. Seismic deformation capacities of each building were obtained by nonlinear static analyses. Inelastic time history analysis was used to predict the seismic displacement demands of the studied buildings. The significance of the findings is further investigated by examining the nonlinear behavior of a group of realistic buildings subjected to near and far-fault ground recordings. Results indicate that there is a remarkable difference in the seismic response of masonry structures between near and far-fault records. It can therefore be concluded that near-fault earthquakes may have significantly more damage potential on masonry structures than far-fault records.

17172,"Economic payback of improved detailing for concrete buildings with precast hollow-core floors A seismic financial risk analysis of typical New Zealand reinforced concrete buildings constructed with topped precast concrete hollow-core units is performed on the basis of experimental research undertaken at the University of Canterbury over the last five years. An extensive study that examines seismic demands on a variety of multi-storey RC buildings is described and supplemented by the experimental results to determine the inter-storey drift capacities of the buildings. Results of a full-scale precast concrete super-assemblage constructed and tested in the laboratory in two stages are used. The first stage investigates existing construction and demonstrates major shortcomings in construction practice that would lead to very poor seismic performance. The second stage examines the performance of the details provided by Amendment No. 3 to the New Zealand Concrete Design Code NZS 3101:1995. This paper uses a probabilistic financial risk assessment framework to estimate the expected annual loss (EAL) from previously developed fragility curves of RC buildings with precast hollow core floors connected to the frames according to the pre-2004 standard and the two connection details recommended in the 2004 amendment. Risks posed by different levels of damage and by earthquakes of different frequencies are examined. The structural performance and financial implications of the three different connection details are compared. The study shows that the improved connection details recommended in the 2004 amendment give a significant economic payback in terms of drastically reduced financial risk, which is also representative of smaller maintenance cost and cheaper insurance premiums.

13212,"Probabilistic approach to the seismic vulnerability of reinforced concrete frame structures by the development of analytical fragility curves Fragility curves are very useful in quantifying the physical and economic damage of buildings that have undergone an earthquake. This paper presents the development of analytical fragility curves representative of mid-rise residential structures built with reinforced concrete, taking into account the specific structural characteristics of Algerian buildings. The derivation of the analytical fragility curves is based on the capacity spectrum method (CSM), which combines a non-linear static analysis (pushover) with a response spectrum analysis. Observation of the consequences of earthquakes of a given intensity shows that the damage to buildings is not identical, even though their construction is similar. This variability of damage can be explained by the variability of a large number of factors such as the local intensity of the hazard, the heterogeneity of the terrain, and the mechanical and geometrical characteristics of the constructions. The materials and patterns of demand spectra were considered as random variables using the Latin Hypercube Sampling Technique. Most of the existing methods that model the damage to structures accept a log-normal distribution hypothesis, where the log-normal law is a model controlled by two parameters: its mean value and its standard deviation. To set these parameters, Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) are performed to generate 1000 samples. The resulting fragility curves following these analyses were applied to two real-life cases of buildings affected by the earthquake of Beni-Ilmane 2010 (Msila, Algeria), so as to assess the damage. © 2017 Materials and Energy Research Center.

21350,"Simplicity versus accuracy trade-off in estimating seismic fragility of existing reinforced concrete buildings This paper investigates the trade-off between simplicity (modelling effort and computational time) and result accuracy in seismic fragility analysis of reinforced concrete (RC) frames. For many applications, simplified methods focusing on “archetype” structural models are often the state-of-practice. These simplified approaches may provide a rapid-yet-accurate estimation of seismic fragility, requiring a relatively small amount of input data and computational resources. However, such approaches often fail to capture specific structural deficiencies and/or failure mechanisms that might significantly affect the final assessment outcomes (e.g. shear failure in beam-column joints, in-plane and out-of-plane failure of infill walls, among others). To overcome these shortcomings, the alternative response analysis methods considered in this paper are all characterised by a mechanics-based approach and the explicit consideration of record-to-record variability in modelling seismic input/demands. Specifically, this paper compares three different seismic response analysis approaches, each characterised by a different refinement: 1) low refinement - non-linear static analysis (either analytical SLaMA or pushover analysis), coupled with the capacity spectrum method; 2) medium refinement - non-linear time-history analysis of equivalent single degree of freedom (SDoF) systems calibrated based on either the SLaMA-based or the pushover-based force-displacement curves; 3) high refinement - non-linear time-history analysis of multi-degree of freedom (MDoF) numerical models. In all cases, fragility curves are derived through a cloud-based approach employing unscaled real (i.e. recorded) ground motions. 14 four- or eight-storey RC frames showing different plastic mechanisms and distribution of the infills are analysed using each method. The results show that non-linear time-history analysis of equivalent SDoF systems is not substantially superior with respect to a non-linear static analysis coupled with the capacity spectrum method. The estimated median fragility (for different damage states) of the simplified methods generally falls within ±20% (generally as an under-estimation) of the corresponding estimates from the MDoF non-linear time-history analysis, with slightly-higher errors for the uniformly-infilled frames. In this latter cases, such error range increases up to ±32%. The fragility dispersion is generally over-estimated up to 30%. Although such bias levels are generally non-negligible, their rigorous characterisation can potentially guide an analyst to select/use a specific fragility derivation approach, depending on their needs and context, or to calibrate appropriate correction factors for the more simplified methods. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd Moment-resisting frames  Portfolio loss assessment  Pushover  Reinforced concrete  SDoF  Seismic fragility  SLaMA  Time history Economic and social effects  Failure (mechanical)  Reinforced concrete  Seismology  Spectrum analysis  Structural analysis  Structural dynamics  Structural frames  Ultrasonic devices  Linear time  Moment resisting frames  Non linear  Portfolio loss assessment  Pushover  Seismic fragility  Single degree of freedoms  SLaMA  Time history  Time history analysis  Degrees of freedom (mechanics)  failure mechanism  multistorey building  reinforced concrete  response analysis  seismic response",Simplicity versus accuracy trade-off in estimating seismic fragility of existing reinforced concrete buildings,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8958811826220666,0.0073615276882248925,0.01254743532380516,0.027437118607552408,Analytical
13285,"Rigorous versus less-demanding fragility relations for RC high-rise buildings Analytical seismic scenario-based probabilistic fragility relations form the spine of earthquake risk assessment and mitigation of RC high-rise wall buildings. In this study, a framework is proposed to develop both rigorous (refined) and less-demanding (cheaper) fragility relations for such structures. Multi-record incremental dynamic analysis is employed using a new scalar intensity measure and net inter-storey drift as a consistent global damage measure for varying heights of buildings. To illustrate the framework, a 30-storey wall building located in a multiple-scenario earthquake-prone region is analysed. The refined fragility sets are derived using 40 real earthquake records representing two seismic scenarios, while the proposed methodology to develop less-demanding seismic scenario-based fragility relations employs a considerably lower number of earthquake records. In this methodology, a new record selection criterion and a fragility curve tolerance factor are introduced. Finally, the two fragility relation sets for the reference structure are developed, assessed, and compared to provide insights into their features and accuracy. Using the proposed methodology, the study revealed that fairly reliable seismic scenario-based fragility sets can be developed for RC high-rise buildings with a significant reduction in computational time and efforts. The proposed framework is generic and can be implemented to deriving refined and less-demanding fragility relations for RC high-rise buildings of different configurations and structural systems. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

21033,"Seismic risk assessment of rocking building contents of multistorey buildings Multi-storey buildings may have a valuable inventory consisting of objects that can be damaged during an earthquake causing unacceptable losses. Building contents are often modelled as equivalent rocking rigid blocks, while their dynamic response depends on the geometry of the object, the characteristics of the building and the storey that the object is located. We discuss the vulnerability, risk and loss assessment of the contents of multi-storey buildings. This is a complicated task, since the response of the block and the structure are coupled, the former being acceleration-sensitive and the latter drift-sensitive. We first discuss a performance-based seismic assessment framework for rocking block objects. Our risk assessment framework is based on nonlinear response history analysis, while simplified approaches using nonlinear static pushover methods are also possible. building contents  ground motion records  nonlinear response history analysis  peak floor acceleration  rigid block None",Seismic risk assessment of rocking building contents of multistorey buildings,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30424876565668657,0.015857909838972256,0.09499365797631146,0.026833492777978248,Analytical
13375,"Seismic fragility curves of steel structure industrial building using IDA method Recent natural disaster events have caused damage to structures and led to loss of lives. Steel structure industrial building is one of the important structures that needs to be examined as these structures can have huge impact on the surrounding areas. Therefore, this study presents the fragility curves and performance curves of steel structure industrial building under earthquake loading. The structure consisted of beam, column, and bracing were modelled using three dimensional finite element modelling. The fragility curves were obtained for the structure, and the performance curves were developed based on lateral load, which was affected by the geometry of the building. Three records of far-field ground motion and three records of local ground motion were used for incremental dynamic analysis (IDA). The five levels of performance stated by FEMA-273, namely, operational phase (OP), immediate occupancy (IO), damage control (DC), life safety (LS), and collapse prevention (CP) were used as main guidelines to evaluate the structural performance. Results showed that, probability damage for operational phase, OP started at 0.19g and 5% of the structure analysed are expected to have immediate occupancy IO, indicating minor cracks to the structure at 0.4g PGA. Moreover, the performance response of the structure to the earthquake was obtained from the study. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

21767,"The Effect of Ten Past Earthquake Records on The Rehabilitation of a 3-Storey Double Unit Tunnel Form Building subjected to In-Plane Lateral Cyclic Loading Tunnel form building is frequently utilised by contractors and developers in constructing high rise building due to its rapid construction process and cost-effective method. However, the capability to cater earthquake load is still questionable. In Malaysia, most of the existing buildings were constructed using BS8110 without any provision to earthquake load. Thus, it is vital to investigate the behaviour of these buildings under the influence of multi-level earthquake records. A 3-storey double unit tunnel form building was designed and constructed using BS 8110 to represent the existing residential apartment in Malaysia. Ten past earthquakes ground motion records of minor, moderate, strong, and great were utilised to determine the effect on the3-storey double unit tunnel form building using fragility curve and capacity-demand response spectrum. From the analysis, the building experienced an extensive damage when subjected to great ground motion, while minor to moderate damages when subjected to moderate and strong ground motion.

17076,"Earthquake damage assessment of masonry churches: proposal for rapid and detailed forms and derivation of empirical vulnerability curves The post-earthquake damage assessment represents the first step after an emergency to support not only the safety of people, but also the preservation of buildings through the realization of prompt and effective provisional interventions. The issue is of particular relevance in case of monumental assets such as churches that are the focus of the paper. In Italy, since 1997 the post-earthquake damage assessment of churches has been carried out using a specific form, which was formally approved in 2001 by the Italian Civil Protection. Being the most advanced tool available in the literature within this specific field, the Italian form has been widely used also internationally. It follows the approach based on the decomposition of the church into macroelements. Although the latter has found wide confirmation through the interpretation of real damage, some critical issues were raised in relation to the versatility of the form and the reliability of the damage index that the approach provides. The post-earthquake damage assessment of 48 unreinforced masonry churches located in New Zealand, hit by the Canterbury earthquake sequence 2010–2011, represented an unprecedented opportunity, at international level, to investigate and to address the aforementioned issues. Starting from some weaknesses of the actual form, a new proposal (named CAF-D) for the damage assessment of unreinforced masonry churches has been developed and presented in the paper. The new form is still based on the macroelement approach, but it considers, in a separate way, the macroelements and the seismic damage modes they might develop, thus overcoming the limitation of the fixed number of damage mechanisms identified a priori by the current Italian form. The more reliable damage assessment approach that such form aims to achieve is the prelude to the development of a specific vulnerability model, derived by combining an empirical and an expert elicitation approach. A specific vulnerability model developed for New Zealand churches, derived by implementing the proposed CAF-D form and the related damage assessment procedure, is presented in the last part of the paper. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

The backbone curves of RBS and WUF connections are extracted from available studies and the backbone curve of DF connection is presented in this study in order to simulating the buildings models. DF, RBS, WUF connections and Panel Zone (PZ) are numerically modeled based on the proposed models provided by the prior researches and these models are applied to analyze low- and high-rise buildings designed in accordance with the relevant standards. Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA) process is utilized to evaluate the effects of DF connection on structural seismic response of SMRFs. Afterwards, the structures’ performance in different response levels is probabilistically assessed by means of IDA and fragility curves. The results show that the seismic demand of SMRFs with DF and RBS connections are so similar, specifically for low-rise buildings. Likewise, SMRFs with DF connection provide up to 43% higher seismic demand in high-rise buildings compared to RBS connection. Eventually, DF connection can be used as an authentic option in SMRFs. © 2019, Korean Society of Civil Engineers.

21188,"Seismic Vulnerability Assessment of School Buildings in Seismic Zone 4 of Pakistan Thick population density and its escalation propensity in seismically active regions of Pakistan has raised sincere concerns about the performance of building stock whose suboptimal performance and complete collapses led to a colossal number of casualties during the past earthquakes. The current research is inspired by the Kashmir earthquake of 2005 which consumed more than 80,000 lives, out of which, approximately 19,000 were children due to wide spread collapse of school buildings. A new database for existing reinforced concrete (RC) school buildings in seismic zone 4 of Pakistan has been developed using the surveyed information and presented briefly. The paper presents the statistics of the data collected through field surveys and professional interviews. It was found that the infrastructural authorities in the considered region developed some specific designs for school buildings, with varying architectural and structural configurations, which were eventually replicated throughout the area. In the current study, almost 2500 schools were surveyed for identifying versatile architectural and structural configurations, and subsequently, 19 different types had been identified, which were eventually used as representative stock for the schools in seismic zone 4 of Pakistan, Muzaffarabad district. The results of the study yield the brief of the collected data from the field and a consolidated methodology for establishing the analytical fragility relationships for one of the 19 structural configurations of the school buildings. A sample building from the collected data has been selected by considering the maximum number of students, and afterwards, the vulnerability is assessed by employing incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) which constitutes the presented methodology. Finally, the fragility curves are developed and presented for the said building type. The derived analytical fragility curves for the considered building type indicate its structural vulnerability and as a whole represent its satisfactory behavior. The vulnerability assessment process and the fragility development are described in an easy manner so that the domestic practicing engineers can readily become able to extend the application towards other school buildings in the region. The developed relationships can be employed for rational decision making so that essential disaster preparedness can be carried out by identifying any need for structural strengthening and interventions. © 2019 Muhammad Zain et al.

21194,"Seismic Vulnerability Assessment of the Yungay’s Historic Urban Center in Santiago, Chile In this paper, a modified empirical large-territorial-scale procedure to assess the seismic vulnerability of aggregate buildings in urban areas located within a highly seismic context is proposed. The methodology is applied to a group of unreinforced masonry (URM) aggregates located in the Yungay’s historic center in downtown Santiago, Chile. This assessment was carried out by modifying and integrating a vulnerability-index-based procedure, a specific existing approach called first level macro-seismic method used to predict seismic damage and loss scenarios through fragility curves of structural components. The procedure was calibrated using the observed damage after the 2010 Chile earthquake in 292 URM structural units. The results of this new damage index for URM aggregate buildings are used to derive Probability Mass Functions (PMFs) of the different damage states and preliminary Empirical Fragility Functions (EFFs). To the best of the authors’ knowledge, these EFFs are the first publicly available for aggregate Chilean URM buildings. This research and its results are the starting point for a more comprehensive study for assessing damage scenarios and vulnerabilities of aggregate URM buildings in historic centers of older Chilean cities. These functions may be used in risk assessment, and are useful to prioritize possible future damage mitigation strategies and other processes involving this historical heritage. We foresee that these results could be at least partially applied to other historical urban areas in Chile, and perhaps other old Latin American cities located along the subduction convergence region between the Pacific and Continental plates, which were founded similarly. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. aggregate buildings  empirical fragility curves  historical urban center  Seismic vulnerability  unreinforced masonry Buildings  Damage detection  Masonry materials  Risk assessment  Seismology  Structural analysis  Aggregate building  Empirical fragility curve  Fragility curves  Historic centres  Historical urban center  Masonry aggregates  Seismic vulnerability  Unreinforced masonries (URMs)  Urban areas  Urban centers  Aggregates","Seismic Vulnerability Assessment of the Yungay’s Historic Urban Center in Santiago, Chile",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1528150564103595,0.6417943190734201,0.021388369350248824,0.002405554741072265,Empirical

17850,"Flood loss estimation using 3D city models and remote sensing data Flood loss modeling provides the basis to optimize investments for flood risk management. However, detailed object-related data are not readily available to generate spatially explicit risk information. Virtual 3D city models and numerical spatial measures derived from remote sensing data provide standardized data and hold promise to fill this gap. The suitability of these data sources to characterize the vulnerability of residential buildings to flooding is investigated using the city of Dresden as a case study, where also empirical data on relative flood loss and inundation depths are available. Random forests are used for predictive analysis of these heterogeneous data sets. Results show that variables depicting building geometric properties are suitable to explain flood vulnerability. Model validation confirms that predictive accuracy and reliability are comparable to alternative models based on detailed empirical data. Furthermore, virtual 3D city models allow embedding vulnerability information into flood risk sensitive urban planning. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

19763,"Probabilistic seismic analysis of base isolated buildings considering near and far field earthquake ground motions The present study aims at constructing an assembly of fragility curves which is a tool for probabilistic investigation of seismic responses for a six storey reinforced concrete base-isolated building, excited by near field (NF) and far field (FF) real ground motions, situated in plain terrain. For the sake of comparison, a similar fixed base building has been chosen. The base isolator adopted is a lead rubber bearing and the design parameters are in accordance to UBC-97. Fragility curves are derived using incremental dynamic analysis method. From the probabilistic demand model, maximum inter-storey drift ratio, maximum base shear and maximum top floor acceleration are computed as the damage parameters whose probability of exceedance (Pf) under predefined damage states for different intensities of earthquakes are recorded. The threshold values of intensity measure are estimated by performing linear regression. Fragility function results illustrated that fixed base buildings have a very high probability of failure in case of both NF and FF earthquakes, which is however, reduced by base isolator. Though the vulnerability of the base-isolated building was quite high for NF earthquakes, Pf for FF earthquakes was nearly negligible. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

To protect such structures against seismic actions, in-depth studies on their vulnerability should be undertaken. This study deals with the seismic vulnerability of a concrete gravity dam. The Oued El Fodda dam on the Oued Chelif River, west Algeria, is considered as a case study. The dam is studied under near- and far-fault ground motions. To derive fragility curves, non-linear time history analyses are performed by using a Latin hypercube sampling numerical simulation procedure. Damage probabilities are determined for each defined limit state. The results show the vulnerability of the dam under high-level seismic motion.

15786,"Assessment of risk to school buildings resulting from distant earthquakes The effects of far distant earthquakes felt in regions with low and moderate seismicity has increased markedly over the last decade. Henceforth fragility curves in this study are to indicate whether buildings are safe to enter or not after an earthquake event occurring more than 300km away. The probability of light, moderate and severe damage states occurring on two and four storey reinforced concrete buildings up to a peak ground acceleration of 0.2g were predicted. The building models were constructed using finite element software based on eight node brick elements with three degrees of freedom at each node. The analysis was carried out using a dynamic response spectrum to calculate the peak inter-storey drift ratios. For the development of fragility curves, the results were collated following a log-normal mean distribution. The results showed that light damage is likely to occur with a probability of over 10% within a 50 year period, while the existing record is unlikely to cause structural damage. The fragility curves were comparable to those for RC moment resisting frames obtained by (Rossetto and Elnashai 2003) at a lower drift limit, with approximately 2% of inter-storey drift ratio.

So, seismic scenarios have been done in some important cities to have an idea about the probable damages in order to carry out the necessary actions for damage limitation.

19722,Probabilistic evaluation of effects of column moment magnification factor on seismic performance of reinforced concrete frames Enhancing column flexural capacity is the key measure in seismic capacity design to achieve strong column-weak beam failure mode and determinate the probabilistic relation between column moment magnification factor (CMMF). In the paper the effects of column moment magnification factor on seismic performance of reinforced concrete (RC) frames are evaluated to limit the occurrence probability of column-hinging failure modes within an acceptable tolerance. Monte Carlo simulation methodology is used to calculate the probability of drift demand exceeding drift capacity of two typical frame structures with consideration of major uncertainties. And fragility curves are constructed to obtain the relationship between CMMF and probability of structural damages and assess the seismic vulnerability of RC frame structures. Results show that the seismic performance of RC frame structures can be significantly enhanced by improving CMMF. The CMMF is required to be equal to or greater than 2.0 to achieve acceptable probability of exceedance of column-hinging failure mode. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

For this purpose, a parametric study on reinforced concrete (RC) buildings is carried out. Study buildings comprise 5-, 10-, 15- and 20-story, RC, code-complying, regular, moment-resisting frames designed for different strength reduction factors, e.g. R = 2, 4 and 6. The input ground motion dataset consists of 734 horizontal components of earthquake accelerograms. The best correlations between IMs and EDPs are computed by regression analysis.

21766,"The effect of ten past earthquake records on the rehabilitation of a 3-storey double unit tunnel form building subjected to in-plane lateral cyclic loading Tunnel form building is frequently utilised by contractors and developers in constructing high rise building due to its rapid construction process and cost-effective method. However, the capability to cater earthquake load is still questionable. In Malaysia, most of the existing buildings were constructed using BS8110 without any provision to earthquake load. Thus, it is vital to investigate the behaviour of these buildings under the influence of multi-level earthquake records. A 3-storey double unit tunnel form building was designed and constructed using BS 8110 to represent the existing residential apartment in Malaysia. Ten past earthquakes ground motion records of minor, moderate, strong, and great were utilised to determine the effect on the 3-storey double unit tunnel form building using fragility curve and capacity-demand response spectrum. From the analysis, the building experienced an extensive damage when subjected to great ground motion, while minor to moderate damages when subjected to moderate and strong ground motion. However, this building survives under the influenced of local minor ground motions. produced. © 2018 Author(s).

21357,"Simplified approach to assess the vulnerability of masonry buildings under tsunami loads Several catastrophic tsunami events in recent years have engaged scientific awareness to assess the tsunami risk. Fragility curves are required to analyse the vulnerability of masonry buildings and analytical fragility curves should be based on local building typologies. The aim of this study was to assess the vulnerability of masonry buildings under tsunami loads by means of the minimum inundation depth to trigger a failure mechanism. This was done using a large-scale approach and with a low knowledge level of the properties of structures. The activation of out-of-plane and in-plane mechanisms was investigated by modelling an external tsunami load pattern using simplified assumptions. Shear and flexural failure were analysed as the main in-plane failure modes while horizontal and vertical bending mechanisms were considered as the main out-of-plane failure modes. Masonry walls were modelled as frame elements and the masonry was modelled as a non-linear material. Japanese guidelines were assumed for modelling tsunami loads instead of more refined models such as those in ASCE 7-16 and Fema P-646, due to the reduced achievable knowledge level. The proposed mechanical models provide important information about the vulnerability of masonry buildings under tsunami loads and represent a basic step to provide vulnerability information on masonry buildings on a regional scale. © 2020 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved. disaster engineering  failure  solid mechanics Masonry construction  Masonry materials  Retaining walls  Risk assessment  Tsunamis  Walls (structural partitions)  Building typologies  Failure mechanism  Fragility curves  Knowledge level  Large-scales  Masonry building  Property  Solid mechanics  Tsunami loads  Tsunami risk  Failure (mechanical)",Simplified approach to assess the vulnerability of masonry buildings under tsunami loads,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.638740604694261,0.004403941471789296,0.010642309018780678,0.006299443891427109,Analytical
18734,"Load-resistance analysis: An alternative approach to tsunami damage assessment applied to the 2011 Great East Japan tsunami Tsunami fragility functions describe the probability of structural damage due to tsunami flow characteristics. Fragility functions developed from past tsunami events (e.g., the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami) are often applied directly, without modification, to other areas at risk of tsunami for the purpose of damage and loss estimations. Consequentially, estimates carry uncertainty due to disparities in construction standards and coastal morphology between the specific region for which the fragility functions were originally derived and the region where they are being used. The main objective of this study is to provide an alternative approach to assessing tsunami damage, especially for buildings in regions where previously developed fragility functions do not exist. A damage assessment model is proposed in this study, where load-resistance analysis is performed for each building by evaluating hydrodynamic forces, buoyancies and debris impacts and comparing them to the resistance forces of each building. Numerical simulation was performed in this study to reproduce the 2011 Great East Japan tsunami in Ishinomaki, which is chosen as a study site. Flow depths and velocities were calculated for approximately 20&thinsp;000 wooden buildings in Ishinomaki. Similarly, resistance forces (lateral and vertical) are estimated for each of these buildings. The buildings are then evaluated for their potential of collapsing. Results from this study reflect a higher accuracy in predicting building collapse when using the proposed load-resistance analysis, as compared to previously developed fragility functions in the same study area. Damage is also observed to have likely occurred before flow depth and velocity reach maximum values. With the above considerations, the proposed damage model might well be an alternative for building damage assessments in areas that have yet to be affected by modern tsunami events. © Author(s) 2019.

12789,"Development of Damage Patterns and Fragility Curves in Brick-nogging Buildings from the Thabeikkyin Earthquake, Myanmar, 2012 The Thabeikkyin earthquake (moment magnitude scale of 6.8) occurred on November 11, 2012; its epicenter was located 25 km from Thabeikkyin Township, Mandalay Region, Myanmar. Many buildings were damaged severely during the earthquake. In this study, damage patterns of brick-nogging buildings were firstly developed, and damage grades were characterized to allow for easy classification of the damaged buildings. The damaged data of all building types in the surveyed areas were collected by classifying the four damage levels as no damage, slight damage, moderate damage, and heavy damage. To develop the damage patterns of brick-nogging buildings, damage categories were arranged into three damage grades (slight, moderate, and heavy damage). Secondly, a questionnaire survey was conducted to calculate the seismic intensities of the affected areas. Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik (MSK) seismic intensities for the surveyed areas were estimated by analyzing the questionnaire survey responses. Finally, fragility curves for brick-nogging buildings were constructed using the estimated seismic intensities from the survey responses combined with the damage levels. These fragility curves may be useful to assess damage to brick-nogging buildings and to predict the number of damaged buildings in future earthquakes. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. 2012 Thabeikkyin Earthquake  Brick-Nogging Building  Damage Pattern  Fragility Curve  MSK Seismic Intensity  Questionnaire Survey Brick  Buildings  Phase shift keying  Surveys  Brick nogging  Damage Pattern  Fragility curves  Questionnaire surveys  Seismic intensity  Earthquakes","Development of Damage Patterns and Fragility Curves in Brick-nogging Buildings from the Thabeikkyin Earthquake, Myanmar, 2012",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,Empirical
21400,"Simulation-Based Fragility Relationships for Unreinforced Masonry Buildings Unreinforced masonry (URM) structures represent a significant portion of the residential building stock of the central and eastern United States. Fifteen percent of homes in the eight-state region impacted by the New Madrid Seismic Zone are URM buildings. The brittle nature of URM buildings further supports a thorough consideration of seismic response given the susceptibility to severe failure modes. Currently, there is a pressing need for analytically based fragility curves for URM buildings. To improve the estimation of damage-state probabilities through the development of simulation-based URM fragilities, an extensive literature survey is conducted on pushover analysis. Using these data, capacity curves are generated, from which damage performance limit states are defined. Demand is simulated using synthetically derived accelerograms representative of the central and eastern United States. Structural response is evaluated using an advanced capacity spectrum method. Capacity, demand, and response are thus derived analytically and utilized to generate a more reliable and uniform set of fragility curves for use in loss-assessment software. This paper presents a framework amenable to rapid, flexible updating that, with the appropriate database of studies, is capable of producing curves representative of any URM building typology subjected to a specified hazard. The curves are expressed in multiple forms to demonstrate capability of use in various loss-assessment applications. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0000648.

17128,"Earthquake risk in reinforced concrete buildings during aftershock sequences based on period elongation and operational earthquake forecasting Rapid post-earthquake damage assessment is critical to short-term earthquake crisis management. Reinforced concrete buildings may accumulate damage during an aftershock sequence, and short-term damage forecasts after the mainshock can aid in decision-making (in particular, on whether to allow immediate occupancy) before further damage actually occurs. This paper presents an operative damage forecasting and building tagging procedure for reinforced concrete buildings during synthetic aftershock sequences near Thessaloniki, Greece, for two hypothetical earthquake scenarios. The synthetic aftershock sequences are simulated, and the time-variant seismic vulnerability is modeled based on fragility curves for the damage state thresholds in terms of period elongation. Period elongation is chosen as a damage proxy because it is available for rapid damage assessment in buildings with permanent monitoring systems or for city-scale post-earthquake surveys. Time-variable damage state probabilities owing to aftershocks are estimated, and a building tagging scheme is proposed based on a traffic-light concept (red-orange-green) to assist in seismic crisis management during aftershock sequences. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Aftershock sequence  Building tagging  Cumulative damage  Seismic vulnerability  Time-variant damage state probability Concrete buildings  Damage detection  Decision making  Earthquake effects  Elongation  Forecasting  Aftershock sequence  Cumulative damage  Damage assessments  Damage state  Earthquake forecasting  Earthquake scenario  Seismic vulnerability  Thessaloniki   Greece  Reinforced concrete",Earthquake risk in reinforced concrete buildings during aftershock sequences based on period elongation and operational earthquake forecasting,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1471774125687472,0.060533148325394914,0.050794429027240455,0.015181779480053217,Analytical
20559,"Seismic fragility analysis of improved RC frames using different types of bracing Application of bracings to increase the lateral stiffness of building structures is a technique of seismic improvement that engineers frequently have recourse to. Accordingly, investigating the role of bracings in concrete structures along with the development of seismic fragility curves are of overriding concern to civil engineers. In this research, an ordinary RC building, designed according to the 1st edition of Iranian seismic code, was selected for examination. According to FEMA 356 code, this building is considered to be vulnerable. To improve the seismic performance of this building, 3 different types of bracings, which are Concentrically Braced Frames, Eccentrically Braced Frames and Buckling Restrained Frames were employed, and each bracing element was distributed in 3 different locations in the building. The researchers developed fragility curves and utilized 30 earthquake records on the Peak Ground Acceleration seismic intensity scale to carry out a time history analysis. Tow damage scale, including Inter-Story Drifts and Plastic Axial Deformation were also used. The numerical results obtained from this investigation confirm that Plastic Axial Deformation is more reliable than conventional approaches in developing fragility curves for retrofitted frames. In lieu of what is proposed, the researchers selected the suitable damage scale and developed and compared log-normal distribution of fragility curves first for the original and then for the retrofitted building. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.

15593,"Analysis of earthquake ground motions using an improved Hilbert–Huang transform Some limitations of the Hilbert–Huang transform (HHT) for nonlinear and nonstationary signal processing are remarked. As an enhancement to the HHT, a time varying vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) model based method is proposed to calculate the instantaneous frequencies of the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) obtained from the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) of a signal. By representing the IMFs as time varying VARMA model and using the Kalman filter to estimate the time varying model parameters, the instantaneous frequencies are calculated according to the time varying parameters, then the instantaneous frequencies and the envelopes derived from the cubic spline interpolation of the maxima of IMFs are used to yield the Hilbert spectrum. The analysis of the length of day dataset and the ground motion record El Centro (1940, N–S) shows that the proposed method offers advantages in frequency resolution, and produces more physically meaningful and readable Hilbert spectrum than the original HHT method, short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and wavelet transform (WT). The analysis of the seismic response of a building during the 1994 Northridge earthquake shows that the proposed method is a powerful tool for structural damage detection, which is expected as the promising area for future research.

12946,"Flood risk mapping for direct damage to residential buildings in Quebec, Canada This paper presents a probabilistic approach for flood risk assessment in a reach of the Richelieu River, south of Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu, Quebec, Canada. The approach is based on a combination of three simple modules: 1) flood frequency analysis (frequency and peak discharge), 2) estimation of inundation depth, and 3) damage and loss estimation. To assess the flood negative impacts, a simple hydraulic model is developed designed to replace and complement the existing 2D model coupled to an existing damage model. By simplifying the spatial coverage of flood calculations, this approach accelerates the computational efficiency enabling a broader set of elements to be combined in a large sample of Monte Carlo simulations applied in the flood risk assessment. The final result is a local scale risk map indicating the expected annual damage to each individual building in the study area useful for flood risk decision making. The analyses show that the approach is particularly powerful for flood risk assessments in areas adjacent to the river for which sufficient data is available. © 2018 2D model  Decision making  Expected annual damage  Flood risk  Monte Carlo None","Flood risk mapping for direct damage to residential buildings in Quebec, Canada",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,Analytical
18068,Fragility functions for estimating damage in non-ductile reinforced concrete columns Drift-based fragility functions are developed for estimating different levels of damage that can be experienced in reinforced concrete columns with poor transverse reinforcement in existing non-ductile buildings. Fragility functions are developed based on the results of 20 different experimental studies conducted in the last 40 years involving a total of 92 different specimens. For damage states involving shear failure and loss of vertical carrying capacity fragility surfaces are developed in which the probability of reaching these damage states is defined not only as a function of the level of lateral drift imposed to the column but also as a function of a normalized axial load that takes into account the level of gravity load and the level of transverse reinforcement present in the column. The proposed fragility functions and fragility surfaces are then used for a probabilistic damage assessment of an existing sevenstory hotel which was severely damaged as a result of the 1994 Northridge earthquake. It is concluded that using the proposed fragility functions leads to improved estimations of the probability of experiencing shear failure in the building columns with respect to force-based approaches.

20574,"Seismic Fragility Analysis of Poorly Built Timber Buildings in Yangon Slum Areas In Yangon and the suburbs of Myanmar, timber-framed buildings are the popular choice of construction for residential purposes. Nearly 8% of the total population in Yangon live in the slums and slum-like areas where the dwellings are predominantly made of non-durable materials. Wood, jungle wood, and bamboo are used as the framework and corrugated galvanized iron sheets as walling and sheathing material. The seismic-resistance capacity of timber buildings in slum areas has never been approved based on experimental evidence. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a seismic fragility analysis for poorly built timber buildings by providing a suitable method through numerical and experimental approaches. Pull-over loading tests were conducted on selected buildings to assess their loading-displacement capacity. Further, numerical modeling was done using the Wallstat simulation tool, which is based on the discrete element method. The pushover curve was validated with the curve from the pull-over load test. Once the numerical model was confirmed, dynamic analysis was conducted for different peak ground acceleration (PGA) (g) values until the complete numerical collapse of the building. Three building configurations with three ranges of variable material properties were considered in this study. A primary damage state started at the low PGA value of 0.05 g, and it can be confirmed that the timber buildings that were studied, are vulnerable to earthquakes. The results based on qualitative analysis were accumulated to obtain the damage state matrix, which was then used to obtain the fragility curves. fragility curve  poorly built timber building  dynamic analysis  pull-over loading test  damage state None",Seismic Fragility Analysis of Poorly Built Timber Buildings in Yangon Slum Areas,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28608747634655624,0.017693943708805778,0.06194170757852544,0.0074266222910704905,Analytical
21232,"Seismic vulnerability of icelandic residential buildings The seismicity in Iceland is related to the Mid-Atlantic plate boundary which crosses the country from north to south. Since 1700, there have been 25 earthquakes of magnitude six or greater in the two major seismic zones in Iceland. For many of the historical earthquakes (older than 100 years), detailed written descriptions are available that describe the damage from farm to farm. For the most recent earthquakes, like the two south Iceland earthquakes of June 2000 and the south Iceland earthquake of May 2008, comprehensive building-by-building loss data exist. The loss data in these cases are split into a number of subcategories of structural and non structural damage. The building stock in south Iceland has changed significantly from 1700 to the present. For ages, vulnerable turf and stone houses dominated, but in the twentieth century, concrete buildings and timber buildings took over. Seismic codes were implemented in 1976 and have gradually improved the seismic capacity of present building stock. In this book chapter, an overview of the seismic performance of old and new Icelandic buildings is given. Observed and reported damage caused by three earthquake sequences and a single event are discussed; first, the damage caused by two earthquakes in August 1784 in south Iceland; then, by the 1896 earthquake sequence in south Iceland; then, the damage after a single event in 1934 in north Iceland; and finally, the loss data from the 2000 and 2008 earthquakes in south Iceland.

20459,"Seismic Damage Evaluation of Gravity Load Designed Low Rise RC Building Using Non-Linear Static Method In India, the 2001 Bhuj earthquake has given a serious warning to many existing reinforced concrete (RC) buildings. However, a considerable portion of the building stock of India is reinforced concrete buildings which are generally designed mainly for gravity loads only. Therefore, potential seismic evaluation of these buildings, especially in high seismic region, is very essential in order to implement any kind of seismic hazard mitigation strategy. Hence, the present study aims to evaluate the seismic vulnerability of low rise RC frame building which is designed for gravity load according to the Indian code. The non-linear static analysis is performed using SAP2000 (v16) to find the capacity curve of the building. Fragility analysis is used to develop the fragility curve for different damage grade based on HAZUS methodology. Damage probability matrices (DPM) are formed for two different seismic hazard levels i.e. for maximum considered earthquake and design basis earthquake depending on the performance point to compare the damage state for each hazard level. The result shows that the damage of considered building is vary from moderate to severe damage state to the corresponding different seismic hazard level. (C) 2016 The Authors.

20561,"Seismic fragility analysis of low-rise unreinforced masonry structures Unreinforced masonry (URM) is one of the most common structural types for low-rise buildings in the United States. Its dynamic behavior is highly nonlinear, and generally shows high vulnerability to seismic loading. Despite the need for seismic risk assessment of this class of structures, the fragility curves for URM buildings based on analytical models are scarce in the field of earthquake engineering. This study performs seismic fragility analysis of a URM low-rise building. Fragility curves are developed for a two-story URM building designed to represent a typical essential facility (i.e., a firehouse) in the central and southern US (CSUS) region. A structural modeling method is proposed such that it can be effectively used for fragility analysis without significant increase in computational time, and maintains an acceptable level of accuracy in representing the nonlinear behavior of the structures. A set of fragility curves are developed and include different configurations of the out-of-plane walls and their associated stiffness. The fragility analysis shows that the seismic performance of URM buildings is well below the desirable building seismic performance level recommended by current seismic codes, indicating high vulnerability of URM buildings within the CSUS region. It is also shown that the out-of-plane wall stiffness should not be ignored in the risk assessment of URM buildings because the overall seismic performance of URM buildings is rather sensitive to the out-of-plane wall stiffness. The analytical fragility curves developed are compared with those of HAZUS. The comparison shows that the analytical fragility curves developed have lower variation in the seismic response than those of HAZUS. Several reasons for the discrepancy are discussed. The model-based analytical fragility curves developed in this study can increase the accuracy and effectiveness of seismic risk assessment of essential facilities of the CSUS region. Moreover, the structural modeling method introduced in this study can be effectively used for development of the fragility curves of URM buildings. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

19738,"Probabilistic Flood Loss Models for Companies Flood loss modeling is a central component of flood risk analysis. Conventionally, this involves univariable and deterministic stage-damage functions. Recent advancements in the field promote the use of multivariable and probabilistic loss models, which consider variables beyond inundation depth and account for prediction uncertainty. Although companies contribute significantly to total loss figures, novel modeling approaches for companies are lacking. Scarce data and the heterogeneity among companies impede the development of company flood loss models. We present three multivariable flood loss models for companies from the manufacturing, commercial, financial, and service sector that intrinsically quantify prediction uncertainty. Based on object-level loss data (n = 1,306), we comparatively evaluate the predictive capacity of Bayesian networks, Bayesian regression, and random forest in relation to deterministic and probabilistic stage-damage functions, serving as benchmarks. The company loss data stem from four postevent surveys in Germany between 2002 and 2013 and include information on flood intensity, company characteristics, emergency response, private precaution, and resulting loss to building, equipment, and goods and stock. We find that the multivariable probabilistic models successfully identify and reproduce essential relationships of flood damage processes in the data. The assessment of model skill focuses on the precision of the probabilistic predictions and reveals that the candidate models outperform the stage-damage functions, while differences among the proposed models are negligible. Although the combination of multivariable and probabilistic loss estimation improves predictive accuracy over the entire data set, wide predictive distributions stress the necessity for the quantification of uncertainty. © 2020.

20751,"Seismic intensity estimation through questionnaire survey and collapse rates of various building types in the 2003 Bam, Iran, Earthquake Seismic intensity in the epicentral area of the 2003 Bam, Iran earthquake is estimated using a questionnaire survey conducted two months after the earthquake. The estimated average seismic intensity on the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) scale is 6.1 (VIII to IX in the MMI scale). The peak frequency of the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio derived from microtremor measurements conducted during reconnaissance is also compared with the seismic intensity. Collapse rates for various structure types, such as adobe, unreinforced/reinforced masonry, steel-frame, and reinforced concrete, are obtained by counting the number of demolished buildings within an area of about 50-m radius around an observation point. Results show large differences in collapse rates between unreinforced and reinforced masonry, and suggest the upper limit of seismic intensity that unreinforced masonry can sustain. This fact can be utilized for an initial damage assessment within affected areas after large earthquakes.

20230,"Scenario-based earthquake loss estimation for the city of Cairo, Egypt This paper describes a multi-tiered loss assessment methodology to estimate seismic monetary implications resulting from structural damage to the building population in Greater Cairo. After outlining a ground-shaking model, data on geological structures and surface soil conditions are collated using a considerable number of boreholes to produce a classification of different soil deposits. An inventory database for the existing building stock is also prepared. The seismic vulnerability of representative reinforced concrete building models, designed according to prevalent codes and construction practices, is evaluated. Capacity spectrum methods are utilised for assessing the structural performance through a multi-level damage scale. A simplified methodology for deriving fragility curves for non-ductile reinforced concrete building classes that typically constitute the building population of the city is adopted. In addition, suitable fragility functions for unreinforced masonry constructions are selected and used for completing the loss model for the study area. The results are finally used to build an event-based loss model caused by possible earthquakes in the region.

22229,"Vulnerability assessment for masonry buildings based on observed damage from the 2016 Amatrice earthquake Recent earthquakes around the world and in Italy showed the seismic vulnerability of the existing building stock. This evidence stresses the need to develop accurate seismic fragili-ty tools, to be applied at territorial scale. Herein, seismic vulnerability curves for existing masonry buildings are developed, based on damage assessment carried out through visual survey and the Copernicus damage maps using EMS-98 damage scale. The observed dam-age dataset consists of damages occurred due to the 24th August 2016 Amatrice earthquake. The study focuses on seven towns close to the epicentre of Amatrice earthquake. The masonry building stock consists of selected buildings belonging to these towns. Ac-celero-metric registrations for the considered earthquake are used to update the GMPE pre-dictions. The resulting ground shaking fields have been modified through application of explicit stratigraphic and topographic factors.

13360,"Seismic fragility assessment of existing masonry buildings in aggregate The paper describes the derivation of fragility curves useful for the seismic risk analyses of existing unreinforced masonry buildings inserted in aggregate. The L-shaped examined aggregate consists of three adjacent structural units that may mutually interact during seismic events. The seismic assessment is focused on the corner unit. The effects of different connection types between the adjacent units on the structural response were investigated. The seismic vulnerability of the masonry aggregate was assessed through nonlinear dynamic analyses (NDA) performed according to the multi-stripes approach. Both the in-plane and out-of-plane mechanisms were analyzed. The in-plane response of the corner unit is assessed through a 3D equivalent frame model of the entire aggregate, while the evaluation of its out-of-plane response makes use of the rigid-block assumption. Although evaluated in a separate way, the NDAs performed on the latter are based on the time histories derived from the global 3D model. The results are then processed in order to derive fragility curves, firstly, of the single failure mechanisms and, then, of the overall combined behavior. To this aim, various performance conditions are examined. For the reference building, the damage limit state is mainly governed by the in-plane behavior, while the collapse limit state by out-of-plane mechanisms. Moreover, the higher the connection level between adjacent structural units, the higher the interaction between in-plane and out-of-plane mechanisms at the collapse limit state.

16581,"Damage Assessment of Reinforced Concrete-Framed Building Considering Multiple Demand Parameters in Indian Codal Provisions This paper investigated multi-objective seismic damage assessment procedure. Primarily, it estimates damage index (DI) of reinforced concrete-framed residential buildings situated in seismic zone V as per IS-1893-2016 (0.36 g) in India. Three-dimensional DI has been estimated for a four-storey building by Park–Ang method. With the increase in the storey number, calculation of Park–Ang DI becomes tedious and more time-consuming procedure; therefore, this method is not suitable for large-scale damage investigation. To avoid the complexity, a simplified method has been proposed to estimate global damage index (GDI) of buildings easily. For this purpose, a four-storey residential building having plan aspect ratio 0.5, 0.75 and 1 has been analysed. In this study, the most influential parameters such as inter-storey drift, joint rotation and peak roof displacement have been combined to estimate GDI of structures directly. Based on this study, it has been observed that 0.893 times ground-storey DI (i.e. local DI) estimates similar Park–Ang GDI for a four-storey building. In this study, it has been observed that ground floor experiences maximum damage and top floor experiences least damage for all cases. The proposed approach effectively estimates reliable GDI that is useful for small- to large-scale damage assessment of buildings. © 2020, Shiraz University.

16101,"Census-based typological usability fragility curves for Italian unreinforced masonry buildings The main vulnerability models available in the literature aim to develop damage fragility curves to estimate the damage level suffered by a building after a seismic event. However, recent earthquakes have highlighted the great importance of predicting the usability of residential buildings, i.e. the condition of a building being habitable or occupiable after a seismic event. The building usability performance can be used as an indicator for allocating economic funding after a seismic event because recent researches have demonstrated a stronger correlation between repair costs and usability assessment rather than between repair costs and structural damage. Therefore, this work focused on the development of census-based fragility curves for the preventive forecast of the usability of Italian unreinforced-masonry buildings. The proposed usability model was calibrated based on the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake database, including almost 60,000 unreinforced-masonry buildings, and this database was increased by adding data from the Italian census to account for uninspected constructions. Six typological classes were defined considering two parameters available both in the post-earthquake and Italian census databases: construction timespan and state of repair. Additionally, it was highlighted in which cases the number of stories was also relevant. The usability fragility curves were defined as a function of peak ground acceleration for two building usability states: partially unusable and unusable. The results confirmed that older buildings are more vulnerable and clearly pointed out the crucial role of the state of repair as a parameter influencing the building usability. © 2022, The Author(s).

20708,"Seismic fragility of base-isolated single-storey unreinforced masonry buildings equipped with classical and recycled rubber bearings in Himalayan regions Unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings are one of the most common constructions all around the world, but they are significantly prone to structural damage in case of earthquake. Due to the high vulnerability of URM buildings to seismic loading, a quantitative risk assessment along with identification of additional protection measures has become necessary. Even though base isolation is a suitable seismic protection option, its conventional cost may prevent a wide implementation in developing countries. In this context, this study presents a comparative seismic fragility analysis of a single-storey URM building before and after base isolation using both classical laminated rubber bearings (LRBs) and recycled-rubber fibre-reinforced elastomeric isolators (RR-FREIs). The main aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness of RR-FREIs as alternative to LRBs for seismic vulnerability reduction of low-resistance URM buildings located in Himalayan regions. Fragility analysis accounted for uncertainties associated with both material properties and earthquake records. The Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) technique was used to reduce the computational work while maintaining acceptable accuracy. The building response was obtained using nonlinear layered shell element models, through nonlinear time history analysis of fixed-base (FB) building models and fast nonlinear analysis of base-isolated (BI) building models. Fragility curves show a significant reduction in the vulnerability of BI buildings in comparison to their FB counterpart, as well as a satisfactory performance of RR-FREIs in comparison with LRBs. A parametric study is also discussed to identify the influence of different intensity measures, fragility analysis method, and variability in isolator properties. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd Developing countries  Fragility analysis  Low-cost elastomeric isolators  Recycled rubber  Seismic base isolation  Unreinforced masonry buildings Bearings (structural)  Cost benefit analysis  Developing countries  Earthquakes  Masonry construction  Masonry materials  Nonlinear analysis  Nonmetallic bearings  Recycling  Rubber  Seismic design  Structural analysis  Uncertainty analysis  Base isolation  Elastomeric isolators  Fibre-reinforced  Fragility analysis  Laminated rubber bearings  Low-cost elastomeric isolator  Low-costs  Recycled rubber  Seismic base isolation  Unreinforced masonry building  Risk assessment",Seismic fragility of base-isolated single-storey unreinforced masonry buildings equipped with classical and recycled rubber bearings in Himalayan regions,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2643320331472092,0.027469243050935826,0.034487889029876234,0.01314522549353399,Analytical

17839,"Flood damage assessment in the Pampanga river basin of the Philippines In this study, a flood damage assessment method was proposed for the assessment of flood risk in data-poor river basins by using a physical-based numerical model, satellite-based information and socio-economic factors. The Pampanga river basin of the Philippines was selected for the case study. For the flood damage assessment, hazard characteristics, such as flood depth and duration, were computed using the rainfall runoff inundation model. Agriculture and households, which are major exposures in flood-prone areas, were taken into account for the flood damage assessment. The potential damage to agriculture was estimated by using the damage functions of agriculture and flood characteristics. The damage functions of agriculture for each growing stage were defined as the function of flood depth and duration. Field investigations and questionnaire surveys were conducted at the selected barangays (villages) in the Pampanga river basin to develop a methodology for household damage estimation. The damage estimation approach for damage to household buildings including assets, was developed based on the flood and household characteristics.

16305,"Comparison of vulnerabilities in typical bridges using macroseismic intensity scales The macroseismic intensity scale in different regions is extensively assessed in the vulnerability assessment of building structures and is rarely used to quantify the damage characteristics of group bridges. To more accurately examine the differences in the seismic vulnerability of typical bridges in an earthquake-damaged region under multiple intensity scales, this study analyses the vulnerability of 1516 girder bridges and 612 arch bridges affected by the Wenchuan earthquake, which occurred on May 12, 2008, in China, by using the European Macroseismic scale, Medvedev, Sponheuer, and Karnik scale, and the Chinese Seismic Intensity scale based on the principle of nonlinear regression and probability models. The vulnerability matrices, functions, and curves of the update models to compare girder bridges and arch bridges were obtained based on the number of samples and their failure ratio. When combined with the new cumulative exceeding probability model, curves of the exceeding probability model of girder bridges and arch bridges under the different intensity scales were obtained and compared. A parameter matrix model is proposed to evaluate and predict the seismic vulnerability of regional bridges. Combined with empirical data on the seismic damage caused to the girder bridges and arch bridges in the earthquake, their vulnerability matrices, curves, and point cloud models were obtained under a multi-intensity scale of assessment for a comparative analysis. The conclusions of this study can be used for an accurate assessment of the vulnerability of typical bridges in the future.

15813,"Assessment of the seismic vulnerability at territorial scale: A new structural-typological classification of existing buildings and definition of fragility curves The seismic risk assessment at territorial level represents a very important topic, particularly for allowing the authorities to forecast damage scenarios in case of catastrophic events. Therefore, with particular reference to earthquakes, the knowledge of the seismic risk of a specific area, more or less wide, constitutes an important starting point for the a-priori evaluation of the consequences related to a significant seismic event and for an optimal management of post-seismic phases. Then the risk assessment at territorial level cannot be performed without the evaluation of the seismic vulnerability of existing buildings. Nevertheless, this evaluation cannot be carried out analysing each construction, because it would be practically impossible and even useless for a prevision at wide level. In this paper, a structural-typological classification of existing masonry and RC buildings is proposed, aimed to an approximate definition of the “global vulnerability” of some areas of the countries.This classification is based mainly on the on-field observation of the structural behaviour showed by the constructions after an earthquake (or however predictable with theoretical considerations). In particular, the damage suffered and the collapse mechanism experienced by RC and masonry buildings during the past earthquakes highlighted a quite evident correlation among the age of construction, the structural characteristics and the damage levels. Starting from these findings, a typological and structural classification, based on some specific elements of the structural scheme strictly related to both age of construction and corresponding constructional techniques has been defined, and some values of the related seismic vulnerability have been provided. Only for masonry buildings, fragility curves, specifically defined on the base of the proposed classification, are also given. © 2018 The International Masonry Society (IMS).

12686,"Collapse risks of fail-safe rc frames due to earthquakes: Fragility assessments The objective of this study was to determine the collapse risk of fail-safe reinforced concrete (RC) frames due to earthquakes by newly developed fragility curves. The curves were constructed based on the collapse mechanism, instead of measures of lateral drift as customarily adopted. The procedure was applied to RC open frames that were seismic resistant. A fail-safe mechanism was imposed by allowing plastic hinges to be formed mainly in the beams. This automatically satisfied the stronger column-weaker beam requirement; shear failure was neither tolerated anywhere in the columns nor in the beams. Two kinds of fail-safe RC frames were investigated: Special moment resisting frames (SMF) and ordinary moment resisting frames (OMF). Their earthquake collapse risk was computed and compared. Inelastic time history (NLTH) and the non-linear static procedure (NSP) were conducted to assess their structural performance. The results showed among others that the fail-safe OMF had lower collapse risk than the fail-safe SMF. The collapse prevention performance level in NLTH could only be achieved for the fail-safe frames. The non-linear time history analysis should be the only method used for seismic reevaluation/safety checking of building frame structures. © 2019 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

21963,"Towards quantifying the effect of aftershocks in seismic risk assessment The state of the art in seismic design and assessment of structures implicitly relies on structural redundancy in order to deal with the effect of the triggered sequence of aftershock events on a building. Calculating the time-dependent limit state exceedance probability for a structure considering both the main event and the triggered sequence of aftershocks is complicated both by the time-dependent rate of aftershock occurrence and also the cumulative damage caused by the sequence of events. Taking advantage of a methodology developed in previous works by the authors for postmainshock risk assessment, the limit state probability due to a sequence of a mainshock and the triggered aftershocks is calculated herein. Moreover, a closed- and analytic-form approximation to the post-mainshock limit state probability given the mainshock magnitude is derived. This closed- and analytic formulation facilitates the estimation of the limit state probability by employing the standard tools in risk assessment such as the fragility curve for the intact structure. Applying the proposed methodology for a reinforced concrete (RC) concrete moment-resisting frame with infills subjected to the main event and the triggered sequence emphasizes the importance of taking into account the cumulative damage caused by the triggered sequence for the case-study model. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the proposed analytical approximation based on the fragility curve for the intact structure leads to a surprisingly close agreement with the best-estimate results obtained by considering the time- and event-dependent degradation in the structure.

16843,"DEVELOPING TSUNAMI FRAGILITY CURVES FROM THE SURVEYED DATA OF THE 2011 GREAT EAST JAPAN TSUNAMI IN SENDAI AND ISHINOMAKI PLAINS Japan was hit by the tsunami generated by the greatest earthquake in the history of Japan. The authors conducted the post-tsunami field survey in Miyagi prefecture immediately after the event to measure the inundation depth and investigate damaged buildings. Most of the buildings surveyed were wooden houses and could be classified into 4 damage levels. The primary data of inundation depth and damage levels obtained from the field survey were used to create the tsunami fragility curves, which described the degree of structural damage as a function of the hydrodynamic characteristics of tsunami inundation. The developed fragility curves show that damage with more than a 50% chance of occurring is classified as minor damage, moderate damage, major damage and complete damage when the tsunami inundation depth is between 2.5-3.0 m, 3.0-4.0 m and 4.0-4.5 m and greater than 4.5 m, respectively. By comparing the developed tsunami fragility curves, wooden houses in the studied area have higher structural performance than those obtained from historical events in other areas. The new curves suggest that wooden houses will be severely damaged if the inundation depth is greater than 3 m and collapse if the depth is greater than 4 m while wooden houses from historical data can resist only 1-2 m. Moreover, wooden walls in Japan reduce the overall failure of a structural member because a wooden wall is easier to destroy (compared to brick walls in Thailand and Indonesia) and allows the tsunami to pass through, which reduces the pressure at the attacking front of the tsunami. The fragility curves are very important for the loss estimation and reconstruction plans of the city; they are also crucial for reducing the disaster damage from a future tsunami.

15498,"An automatic procedure for deriving building portfolios using the Italian CARTIS online database Modelling of exposure is one of the most relevant challenges in seismic vulnerability assessments at the large scale, because of the large number of buildings to be handled whose geometrical and structural features may vary significantly. In these cases, it is convenient to identify a suite of archetype buildings that are deemed representative of the whole building stock. To this end, a novel procedure to define building portfolios for seismic vulnerability assessments at the regional/national scale is proposed. Building information is derived from an existing database for Italian municipalities that includes the main features of unreinforced masonry and reinforced concrete residential buildings surveyed with the so-called CARTIS form. The procedure is implemented in MATLAB to make the process of analysing the information for each municipality and identifying a manageable number of representative building sub-typologies fully automated and requiring only little input from the user.

15197,"A model taxonomy for flood fragility and vulnerability assessment of buildings In the last two decades, probabilistic approaches to flood risk modeling have emerged, often as an extension of more consolidated methods used in probabilistic seismic risk assessment. Nonetheless, only a few studies deal with best-practice methodologies for flood physical vulnerability assessment, and existing approaches/models often lack appropriate guidance for their selection/rating and use. These concerns underline the need for a rational, integrated and comprehensive compendium of existing flood-related fragility (i.e., the likelihood of various damage states as a function of hazard intensity measure(s)) and vulnerability (i.e., the likelihood of loss levels as a function of hazard intensity measure(s)) models to be used in probabilistic flood risk assessment. To this aim, and following the approach used in the guidelines recently developed by the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) project, this paper proposes a model taxonomy for flood fragility and vulnerability assessment of buildings. A review of state-of-the-art large-scale models for flood vulnerability assessment is first carried out. A discussion on the main factors affecting the reliability of empirical fragility and vulnerability relationships is presented, focusing on data sources, building classification, statistical techniques for data collection/fitting, and damage scales/loss metrics. As a proof of concept, a compendium of existing studies dealing with empirical fragility and vulnerability models for buildings is finally developed and discussed based on the proposed model taxonomy. This type of database can benefit (re)insurance companies interested in flood loss assessment and various decision-makers (e.g., governmental agencies) committed to mitigate flood risk and communicate its level to different stakeholders.

19521,"Physical vulnerability models for assessing building damage by debris flows A catastrophic debris flow occurred in Zhouqu County, Gansu Province, Northwestern China, at midnight on 7 August 2010, resulting in damage to >390 buildings. Assessment of the vulnerability of buildings to debris flow hazards is essential to quantify the risk of debris flows. This paper presents a new family of physical vulnerability curves to assess the damage to buildings by debris flows based on extensive observed data of building damage and simulated debris flow intensity. A database of damaged buildings in the affected area of the Zhouqu debris flow was reconstructed. Numerical simulations using FLO-2D were conducted to determine the intensity of debris flows. A series of physical vulnerability empirical models for assessing the building damage has been proposed using various hazard intensity measures. Since buildings of different structural types have different resistances to debris flows, the vulnerability functions were developed for two typical types of structures, i.e. brick-concrete structures and reinforced concrete-frame structures. The proposed vulnerability functions are comparable with those for debris flows in Switzerland, Italy and Austria. The buildings may be completely destroyed when the debris flow depth is more than one half of the building height for both types of building structures.

12951,"Fragility analysis of a real building The purpose of this study is to develop the fragility curve associated with a real building. An approach to estimate seismic fragility without the need to perform the nonlinear dynamic analysis for determining the damage state of the structure as well as without the need to perform the Monte Carlo simulation for calculating the damage probability with respect to ground motion of different intensities is developed here. The capacity spectrum method is modified to determine the damage state of the target building. Consequently, nonlinear push over analysis is performed to obtain the capacity curve of the building and the damage states of the structure can then be determined by using the performance curve derived from capacity curve and code spectrum associated with ground motion within certain range of peak ground acceleration (PGA) values. Fragility curves in this study are assumed to be lognormal distribution described by two parameters and are developed as a function of PGA. The estimation of these two parameters is done by the maximum likelihood method treating each event of damage as a realization from a Bernoulli experiment. In fact, genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to obtain the parameters. The uncertainty associated with the ground motion is simulated by analyzing the statistical characteristics of the records of ground motion collected near the site. In addition, the uncertainties associated with the capacity spectrum and the thresholds of different damage states are also analyzed. Finally, fragility curves considering different level of uncertainties are constructed and compared for target building. Copyright © 2019 European Safety and Reliability Association.

17918,"Fragility analysis of mid-rise R/C frame buildings Fragility curves are useful tools for showing the probability of structural damage due to earthquakes as a function of ground motion indices. The aim of this study is to develop the fragility curves for mid-rise R/C frame buildings in Istanbul, which have been designed according to the 1975 version of the Turkish seismic design code, based on numerical simulation with respect to the number of stories of the buildings. Sample 3, 5 and 7 story buildings were designed according to the Turkish seismic design code. Incremental dynamic analyses were performed for those sample buildings using twelve artificial ground motions to determine the yielding and collapse capacity of each sample building. Based on those capacities, fragility curves were developed in terms of elastic pseudo spectral acceleration, peak ground acceleration (PGA) and elastic spectral displacement for yielding and collapse damage levels with lognormal distribution assumption. To investigate the effect due to the number of stories of the building on fragility parameters, regression analysis has been carried out between fragility parameters and the number of stories of the building. It was observed that fragility parameters change significantly due to the number of stories of the building. Finally, using constructed fragility curves and statistical methods, the maximum allowable inter-story drift ratio and spectral displacement values that satisfy the ""immediate occupancy"" and ""collapse prevention"" performance level requirements were estimated. © 2006.

16244,"Comparative earthquake loss estimations for high-code buildings in Istanbul The paper presents the probabilistic and scenario based earthquake loss estimations for the case that the hazard and building inventory inputs are kept the same whereas the damage functions as well as the seismic demand estimation method are changed in an earthquake loss model. Spectral acceleration-displacement based damage assessments by alternating damage functions and inelastic demand evaluation methods are performed for high-code buildings in Istanbul. The buildings are mid- and high-rise, reinforced concrete, moment-resisting frames that are assumed to be designed in accordance with the provisions of Turkish Earthquake Resistant Design Code (1998). Three damage models, i.e. structural capacity and fragility curves, are employed for each building class: Expert judgment based capacity and fragility functions; HAZUS's high-code seismic design level capacity and fragility functions; and Capacity and fragility functions derived based on nonlinear analyses of code complying RC frames. Inelastic spectral displacement demands are computed with three methods: Capacity Spectrum Method, Modified Acceleration-Displacement Response Spectrum Method, and Displacement Coefficient Method. Analyses are realized under site-specific ground motions based on a state-of-the-art hazard model for eight return periods ranging from 100 to 2475 years as well as for an Mw = 7.5 scenario earthquake. Probabilistic loss curves for each case are developed. Estimated average annual losses (AAL) and loss ratios (AALR) are compared. Grid and district based maps illustrating the spatial distributions of estimated long term average losses per year and the loss ratios are presented.

20044,"Reliability and fragility assessment of the mid- and high-rise wood buildings subjected to bidirectional seismic excitation Often the estimation of reliability and fragility curve for a structure subjected to earthquake loading is carried out for unidirectional ground motions, even though the multicomponent ground motions can affect the seismic responses. A simple procedure to estimate the reliability of 3D bisymmetric buildings subjected to the bidirectional orthogonal ground motions is proposed in the present study. The procedure considers that the responses of a 3D bisymmetric building can be approximated by those of an equivalent nonlinear inelastic two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) system. The parameters of the equivalent system are identified using the capacity surface of the buildings obtained through nonlinear static pushover analysis or incremental dynamic analysis. The procedure is applied to estimate the reliability and fragility of mid- and high-rise wood buildings subjected to bidirectional ground motions. A comparison of the estimated reliabilities and fragilities by considering uni- and bi-directional ground motions is given, showing the importance of considering the bidirectional ground motions. The results indicate that the failure probabilities under the bidirectional ground motions are greater as compared to those obtained under the unidirectional ground motions. Therefore, for assessing the reliability of building under the seismic ground motions, the consideration of bidirectional ground motion can be important for seismic risk modelling and emergency preparedness. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd Bidirectional ground motions  Capacity surface  Fragility curve  Reliability  Tall timber buildings Columns (structural)  Degrees of freedom (mechanics)  Earthquakes  Risk assessment  Wooden buildings  Bi-directional ground motions  Emergency preparedness  Fragility curves  Incremental dynamic analysis  Nonlinear static pushover analysis  Seismic ground motions  Timber buildings  Two-degree of freedom  Reliability  ground motion  loading  multistorey building  reliability analysis  seismic response  timber",Reliability and fragility assessment of the mid- and high-rise wood buildings subjected to bidirectional seismic excitation,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3489450407700771,0.025986174660574804,0.030652102939873627,0.015074563565636736,Analytical
16132,"Characterisation of the masonry building stock in Portugal for earthquake risk assessment According to the latest national housing census, masonry buildings represent more than half of the Portuguese buildings stock and houses over 40% of the population. Due to their low tensile strength, massive weight, and inadequate maintenance, these buildings are prone to damage due to ground shaking. In this study, a characterisation of the geometric and mechanical properties of the two most common types of masonry buildings in Portugal (limestone and granite) is presented. This characterisation is based on the detailed revision of technical specifications and drawings from more than 200 buildings from different parts of the country. The evaluation of the collected data allowed defining statistical models for the most relevant geometric and mechanical properties, which can be used in the development of analytical vulnerability models. This study contributes to the understanding of the seismic vulnerability of this important type of construction in Portugal, and its results can be used directly in seismic risk assessment at the national scale.

After compiling the building inventory in each city, fragility curves were derived using a hybrid approach previously developed by the authors, and a series of seismic scenarios were derived based on microzonation studies that were specifically conducted for each city (see companion paper by Pitilakis et al.). The results obtained in terms of damage estimates, required restoration times and the associated costs are presented in a GIS environment. It is deemed that both the results obtained, and the overall methodology and tools developed, contribute towards the enhancement of seismic safety in the Mediterranean area (as well as other earthquake-prone regions), while they constitute a useful pre-earthquake decision-making tool for local authorities.

15775,"Assessment of potential seismic damage to residential unreinforced masonry buildings in Northern Illinois Ground acceleration estimates for northern Illinois are used to assess any damage that can occur to unreinforced masonry (URM) residential structures as a result of potential future earthquakes. These estimates are based on probable future activities in the New Madrid Seismic Zone and are published by the U.S. Geological Survey for exceedance probabilities equal to 0.10, 0.05, and 0.02 per 50 years. Accelerations corresponding to higher exceedance probabilities (1.0 and 0.25 probability in 50 years) are obtained from simplified seismic hazard analyses. Damage is estimated based on fragility curves available for URM buildings. The probability of damage is then used along with the inventory of buildings to arrive at estimates of the percentage and the number of buildings that may suffer damage of various levels (ranging from nonstructural damage to total collapse). The study shows that considering p=1 exceedance probability in 50 years (i.e., a 50 year return period), the maximum acceleration for the area will be about 0.017g. This acceleration causes slight damage to about 1% of buildings and nonstructural damage to about 4% of them. With an acceleration of 0.057g, about 1% of URM buildings will experience severe damage, 5% moderate damage, 17% slight damage, and 53% nonstructural damage. This acceleration is based on p=0.1 exceedance probability in 50 years. A very rare event at p=0.05 exceedance probability in 50 years corresponds to 0.101g acceleration and may cause collapse in about 1.5% of buildings, severe damage to 4%, moderate damage to 16%, slight damage to 42%, and nonstructural damage to 84% of URM buildings. © ASCE.

21998,"Tsunami damage to ports: Cataloguing damage to create fragility functions from the 2011 Tohoku event Modern tsunami events have highlighted the vulnerability of port structures to these high-impact but infrequent occurrences. However, port planning rarely includes adaptation measures to address tsunami hazards. The 2011 Tohoku tsunami presented us with an opportunity to characterise the vulnerability of port industries to tsunami impacts. Here, we provide a spatial assessment and photographic interpretation of freely available data sources. Approximately 5000 port structures were assessed for damage and stored in a database. Using the newly developed damage database, tsunami damage is quantified statistically for the first time, through the development of damage fragility functions for eight common port industries. In contrast to tsunami damage fragility functions produced for buildings from an existing damage database, our fragility functions showed higher prediction accuracies (up to 75% accuracy). Pre-tsunami earthquake damage was also assessed in this study and was found to influence overall damage assessment. The damage database and fragility functions for port industries can inform structural improvements and mitigation plans for ports against future events. © Copyright: None earthquake event  photography  port  risk assessment  Tohoku earthquake 2011  tsunami event  Japan",Tsunami damage to ports: Cataloguing damage to create fragility functions from the 2011 Tohoku event,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11875371521567532,0.16912958755766708,0.059743275170161515,0.010411534123612102,Empirical
12595,"Analytical fragility curves of reinforced concrete buildings subject to tsunami waves The prediction of damages caused by a tsunami over a large coastal area is a complex problem. One of the issues is the evaluation of the structural damage to buildings and infrastructures. A tsunami is preceded by a ground motion, both are caused by an earthquake. The coastal structures are hit, within a short period of time by both phenomena. In this study, we developed a method to build fragility curves for reinforced concrete structures subject to tsunami. The fragility curves are function of the intensity measure of the tsunami wave: wave height. The fragility curves of a prototype reinforced concrete building were computed through non-linear static analysis.

21955,"Towards an integrated approach for coastal flood impact assessment Human settlements along coasts and estuaries are increasingly at risk from flooding due to a combination of inappropriate development, rising sea level, insufficient investment in the maintenance of flood defences, and the interaction of rising sea levels with storm surges. This paper describes the development of a dynamical storm surge and inundation model in combination with an analysis of residence vulnerability for two case study sites along the English east coast to investigate the consequences for residential areas of a major sea defence failure. The model is developed to provide detailed information about floodwater depths and velocities that can be expected for different storm conditions and defence failure scenarios. At the same time, failure in residences due to floodwater loading is examined by investigating load characteristics along with damage and failure load parameters for a range of residences. Drawing on historical accounts, field surveys and insurance loss data, those features of residential buildings which govern the structure's vulnerability to flood damage are identified. The examination of the impact of floodwater forces represents a new approach to damage assessment and enables a more accurate prediction of potential losses, both for the case study sites and for larger spatial scales.

21168,"Seismic vulnerability assessment of minor Italian urban centres: development of urban fragility curves This paper presents a novel hybrid-based methodology devoted to develop urban fragility curves and damage probability matrices to predict likelihood seismic damage scenarios for small and medium Italian urban centres, considering URM buildings only. The concept of urban fragility curve consists of a single curve mean-representative of the seismic fragility of an entire area accounting for the combinations of building classes and their percentage, then they differ from those typological. The methodology has been developed with reference to Rocca di Mezzo, a small Italian urban centre located in the central Apennine area, Italy. Based on CarTiS inventory, building classes have been firstly recognized and urban fragility curves, representative for damage scenarios at Ultimate Limit State, developed. To predict damage scenarios from low to high-intensity earthquakes, an approach to define multi-damage urban fragility curves and damage probability matrices has been also presented. To this aim, a damage scale suffered by building classes has been defined by converting the final outcomes of the AeDES form (used in Italy for post-earthquake surveys) in the damage levels provided by the European Macroseismic Scale (EMS98). Data coming from urban fragility curves have been compared with the actual damage scenario recorded in Rocca di Mezzo after the 2009 Lâ€™Aquilaâ€™s earthquake, in terms of both peak-ground acceleration and Mecalli-Cancani-Sieberg scale. The achieved results showed a good accordance between theoretical predictions and actual damage scenarios, coherent also with the damage scenarios occurred in other Italian historical centres hit by severe earthquakes over the years. Thus, the methodology can provide a first important indicator to support the development of emergently plans devoted to identify priority of interventions in such areas particularly vulnerable with respect to others.

17710,"Exposure and vulnerability estimation for modelling flood losses to commercial assets in Europe Commercial assets comprise buildings, machinery and equipment, which are susceptible to floods. Existing damage models and exposure estimation methods for this sector have limited transferability between flood events and therefore limited potential for pan-European applications. In this study we introduce two methodologies aiming at improving commercial flood damage modelling: (1) disaggregation of economic statistics to obtain detailed building-level estimates of replacement costs of commercial assets; (2) a Bayesian Network (BN) damage model based primarily on post-disaster company surveys carried out in Germany. The BN model is probabilistic and provides probability distributions of estimated losses, and as such quantitative uncertainty information. The BN shows good accuracy of predictions of building losses, though overestimates machinery/equipment loss. To test its suitability for pan-European flood modelling, the BN was applied to three case studies, comprising a coastal flood in France (2010) and fluvial floods in Saxony (2013) and Italy (2014). Overall difference between modelled and reported average loss per company was only 2–19% depending on the case study. Additionally, the BN model achieved better results than six alternative damage models in those case studies (except for one model in the Italian case study). Further, our exposure estimates mostly resulted in better predictions of the damage models compared to previously published pan-European exposure data, which tend to overestimate exposure. All in all, the methods allow easy modelling of commercial flood losses in the whole of Europe, since they are applicable even if only publicly-available datasets are obtainable. The methods achieve a higher accuracy than alternative approaches, and inherently provide confidence intervals, which is particularly valuable for decision making under high uncertainty. © 2018 Flood exposure  Flood risk  Flood vulnerability  Hydrodynamic models Bayesian networks  Decision making  Flood damage  Machinery  Probability distributions  Confidence interval  Damage modelling  Economic statistics  Exposure estimates  Exposure estimation  Flood modelling  Replacement costs  Uncertainty informations  Uncertainty analysis  building  decision making  flood damage  modeling  vulnerability  article  Bayesian network  decision making  disaster  flooding  France  Germany  hydrodynamics  Italy  prediction  probability  quantitative analysis  uncertainty  France  Germany  Italy  Saxony",Exposure and vulnerability estimation for modelling flood losses to commercial assets in Europe,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019211908790306306,0.07248130364066455,0.011843644997795277,0.06600983117073289,Empirical
16166,"Cloud Capacity Spectrum Method: Accounting for record-to-record variability in fragility analysis using nonlinear static procedures This paper investigates a number of computational issues related to the use of nonlinear static procedures in fragility analysis of structures. Such approaches can be used to complement nonlinear dynamic procedures, reducing the computational and modelling effort. Specifically, this study assesses the performance of the Capacity Spectrum Method (CSM) with real (i.e. recorded) ground motions (as opposed to code-based conventional spectra) to explicitly account for record-to-record variability in fragility analysis. The study focuses on singledegree-of-freedom systems, providing a basis for future multi-degree-of-freedom system applications. A casestudy database of 2160 inelastic oscillators is defined through parametric backbones with different elastic periods, (yield) base shear coefficients, values of the ductility capacity, hardening ratios, residual strength values and hysteresis rules. These case studies are analysed using 100 real ground motions. An efficient algorithm to perform the CSM with real spectra is proposed, combined with a cloud-based approach (Cloud-CSM) to derive fragility relationships. Simple criteria to solve the issue of multiple CSM solutions (i.e. two or more points on the backbone satisfying the CSM procedure) are proposed and tested. It is demonstrated that the performance point selection can be carried out based on a particularly efficient intensity measure detected via optimal intensity measure analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed Cloud-CSM in fragility analysis is discussed through extensive comparisons with nonlinear time-history analyses, the code-based N2 method, and a simple method involving an intensity measure as a direct proxy for the performance displacement. The Cloud-CSM provides errors lower than +/- 20% in predicting the median of the fragility curves in most of the analysed cases and outperforms the other considered methodologies in calculating the fragility dispersion.

17355,"Empirical Fragility Curves of Buildings in Northern Miyagi Prefecture During the 2011 off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku Earthquake In this study, empirical fragility curves expressed in terms of relationship between damage ratio indices of buildings and ground motion indices were developed in northern Miyagi prefecture located in near-field areas during the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake. The ground motion indices were evaluated from observed ground motions at strong-motion stations and estimated at sites at which no strong-motion accelerometers were deployed during the mainshock. The ground motions at the non-instrumental sites were estimated using the empirical Green's function method based on bedrock motions inverted from observed records on surfaces from small events that occurred inside the source fault, transfer functions due to underground velocity structures identified from microtremor H/V spectral ratios, and a short-period source model of the mainshock. The findings indicated that the empirical fragility curves as functions of Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) instrumental seismic intensity during the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake almost corresponded to those during the 1995 Kobe Earthquake and the seven disastrous earthquakes that occurred between 2003 and 2008. However, the empirical fragility curves as functions of peak ground velocity were the lowest. A possible reason for this is that the response spectra of the ground motions in the period ranging from 1.0 s to 1.5 s were small during the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake. Another reason could be the seismic resistant capacities of buildings in the studied districts involved during the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake exceeded those in the cities affected during the 1995 Kobe Earthquake. empirical fragility curves  the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake  microtremor H/V spectral ratio  damage ratio indices  estimated ground motions None",Empirical Fragility Curves of Buildings in Northern Miyagi Prefecture During the 2011 off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku Earthquake,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,Empirical
20342,"Seismic capacity and vulnerability assessment considering ageing effects: case study—three local Portuguese RC buildings A high percentage of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings in Portugal were designed and built before the introduction of modern seismic codes. This research aims to assess the seismic capacity and vulnerability of RC buildings in the city of Lisbon. For that purpose, nonlinear static procedures have been used and fragility curves have been developed. These buildings are reaching the end of their nominal life. Therefore, ageing effects have been taken into account, as well as the presence of smooth rebar. To do so, a sensitivity analysis has been performed by considering the chloride-induced corrosion of the reinforcement steel rebar and the degradation of the concrete cover. To illustrate the effects of ageing and the procedure adopted for the seismic fragility assessment of old RC structures, three RC buildings with masonry infills have been selected as case studies. They were all built between 1960 and 1980, and they are representative of the current building stock in Lisbon. The seismic capacity of the buildings has been determined by means of nonlinear static analyses of three-dimensional numerical models. The N2 method and its extended version have been considered to determine the target displacement. The seismic safety of the buildings has been estimated in terms of the demand/capacity ratio for each vertical structural element (columns and walls) according to the bending and the shear failures. Then, a set of fragility curves has been developed for all buildings to represent the probability of RC elements reaching or exceeding the significant damage limit state. Results have shown that the concrete strength degradation has had more influence than reduction of the rebar diameter in the seismic capacity. When considering steel corrosion, it has been demonstrated that the corrosion rate has reduced the capacity more than the time of exposure. It can be concluded that ageing affects the seismic behaviour of RC structures, increasing the vulnerability of these buildings. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

18083,"Fragility of masonry veneers to human-induced Central U.S. earthquakes using neural network models Since 2008, an increase in human-induced seismic activity related to natural gas production and petroleum activities has resulted in millions of dollars of damage in the Central United States, primarily to residential buildings including chimneys and masonry veneers. This study aims to better understand and evaluate the impacts of such seismic hazards on masonry veneers. To do so, a probabilistic framework is proposed in which fragility curves representing the probability of cracking and collapse damage states for masonry veneers are developed. In the proposed framework, Artificial Neural Networks are adopted to develop probabilistic seismic demand models from experimentally-validated finite element analyses of non-seismically detailed masonry veneers. The framework utilizes a suite of 200 ground motions largely believed to be from human-induced earthquakes with magnitudes of 3.6â€“5.8 recorded in the Central U.S. since 2008. Fragility curves are produced for masonry veneers with code compliant corrugated brick ties and those with thinner brick ties that are commonly employed in residential construction in the Central U.S. Additionally, the proposed fragilities developed for human-induced earthquakes are compared to those from the literature, which were developed for the New Madrid seismic hazard and are commonly used for seismic vulnerability assessments of infrastructure in the Central U.S. The results indicate that for a given PGA level, induced earthquakes may be more likely to produce damage compared to earthquakes representing the New Madrid hazard. Finally, the regional extents of damage from a recent induced seismic event are estimated using the newly developed and existing fragility functions to evaluate the implications of using these models for regional vulnerability assessments.

21195,"Seismic Vulnerability Assessment of the Yungay's Historic Urban Center in Santiago, Chile In this paper, a modified empirical large-territorial-scale procedure to assess the seismic vulnerability of aggregate buildings in urban areas located within a highly seismic context is proposed. The methodology is applied to a group of unreinforced masonry (URM) aggregates located in the Yungay's historic center in downtown Santiago, Chile. This assessment was carried out by modifying and integrating a vulnerability-index-based procedure, a specific existing approach called first level macro-seismic method used to predict seismic damage and loss scenarios through fragility curves of structural components. The procedure was calibrated using the observed damage after the 2010 Chile earthquake in 292 URM structural units. The results of this new damage index for URM aggregate buildings are used to derive Probability Mass Functions (PMFs) of the different damage states and preliminary Empirical Fragility Functions (EFFs). To the best of the authors' knowledge, these EFFs are the first publicly available for aggregate Chilean URM buildings. This research and its results are the starting point for a more comprehensive study for assessing damage scenarios and vulnerabilities of aggregate URM buildings in historic centers of older Chilean cities. These functions may be used in risk assessment, and are useful to prioritize possible future damage mitigation strategies and other processes involving this historical heritage. We foresee that these results could be at least partially applied to other historical urban areas in Chile, and perhaps other old Latin American cities located along the subduction convergence region between the Pacific and Continental plates, which were founded similarly.

16133,"Characteristics of building fragility curves for seismic and non-seismic tsunamis: Case studies of the 2018 Sunda Strait, 2018 Sulawesi-Palu, and 2004 Indian Ocean tsunamis Indonesia has experienced several tsunamis triggered by seismic and non-seismic (i.e., landslides) sources. These events damaged or destroyed coastal buildings and infrastructure and caused considerable loss of life. Based on the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) guidelines, this study assesses the empirical tsunami fragility to the buildings inventory of the 2018 Sunda Strait, 2018 Sulawesi-Palu, and 2004 Indian Ocean (Khao Lak-Phuket, Thailand) tsunamis. Fragility curves represent the impact of tsunami characteristics on structural components and express the likelihood of a structure reaching or exceeding a damage state in response to a tsunami intensity measure. The Sunda Strait and Sulawesi-Palu tsunamis are uncommon events still poorly understood compared to the Indian Ocean tsunami (IOT), and their post-tsunami databases include only flow depth values. Using the TUNAMI two-layer model, we thus reproduce the flow depth, the flow velocity, and the hydrodynamic force of these two tsunamis for the first time. The flow depth is found to be the best descriptor of tsunami damage for both events. Accordingly, the building fragility curves for complete damage reveal that (i) in Khao Lak-Phuket, the buildings affected by the IOT sustained more damage than the Sunda Strait tsunami, characterized by shorter wave periods, and (ii) the buildings performed better in Khao Lak-Phuket than in Banda Aceh (Indonesia). Although the IOT affected both locations, ground motions were recorded in the city of Banda Aceh, and buildings could have been seismically damaged prior to the tsunami's arrival, and (iii) the buildings of Palu City exposed to the Sulawesi-Palu tsunami were more susceptible to complete damage than the ones affected by the IOT, in Banda Aceh, between 0 and 2g m flow depth. Similar to the Banda Aceh case, the Sulawesi-Palu tsunami load may not be the only cause of structural destruction. The buildings' susceptibility to tsunami damage in the waterfront of Palu City could have been enhanced by liquefaction events triggered by the 2018 Sulawesi earthquake. © 2021 The Author(s).

17713,"Extending displacement-based earthquake loss assessment (DBELA) for the computation of fragility curves This paper presents a new procedure to derive fragility functions for populations of buildings that relies on the displacement-based earthquake loss assessment (DBELA) methodology. The recent developments in this methodology are also presented herein, such as the development of new formulae for the calculation of the yield period or the consideration of infilled frame structures. In the fragility method proposed herein, thousands of synthetic buildings have been produced considering probabilistic distributions describing the variability in their geometrical and material properties. Then, their nonlinear capacity has been estimated using the DBELA method and their performance against a large set of ground motion records has been calculated. Global limit states are used to estimate the distribution of buildings in each damage state for different levels of ground motion, and a regression algorithm is applied to derive fragility functions for each limit state. The proposed methodology is demonstrated for the case of ductile and non-ductile Turkish reinforced concrete buildings with and without masonry infill walls, and compared with results obtained using nonlinear dynamic procedures and with the results from previous studies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

15626,"Analytical displacement-based seismic fragility analysis of stone masonry buildings In an effort to reduce seismic risks, the Geological Survey of Canada has recently taken important steps by initiating a project on quantitative assessment of earthquake related risks. One of the objectives of this project is to study the seismic vulnerability of historic stone masonry buildings generally known for their poor performance during strong ground motion. This paper focuses on the development of analytical displacement-based fragility curves reflecting the characteristics of existing stone masonry buildings in Canada. The fragility analysis provides the necessary link between the building damage and earthquake intensity in a probabilistic setting, where the extent of building damage is best correlated to the amount of induced building displacement. The old historic center of Quebec City was selected as a typical study area due to the concentration of stone masonry buildings, which combined to the high heritage value increases the potential consequences of failure. Comparison was made with similar fragility curves implicit in Hazus-MH and ELER seismic risk assessment tools. Differences have been observed between the three sets of fragility curves which may lead to significantly disparate damage estimates. This comparison shows the importance of the development of fragility curves specific to the generic construction characteristics in the study area and emphasizes the need of critical use of existing risk assessment tools and generated results.

The vulnerability associated with this city has increased due to haphazard development, owing to rapid urbanization and industrial development. This article focuses on evaluating the performance of an existing mid-rise RC frame building in a densely populated area of the city. The selected stock building is precisely modeled in SAP2000 for carrying out its pushover analysis from which the capacity spectrum is obtained as per the recommendations of ATC-40. Finally, the Fragility curve is produced as per the guidelines of HAZUS and the damageability function of the building is calculated.

15652,"Application of fragility curves to estimate building damage and economic loss at a community scale: A case study of Seaside, Oregon Community-scale estimates of building damage and economic loss are modeled for Seaside, Oregon, for Cascadia subduction zone events ranging from 8.7 to 9.3 MW with corresponding slip distances of 3-25 m considering only the effects of the tsunami. Numerical simulations are obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's method of splitting tsunami model which includes a source model, subsidence, and calculations of the propagation and inundation flow characteristics. The damage estimates are based on fragility curves from the literature which relate flow depth with probability of damage for two different structural materials of buildings. Calculations are performed at the parcel level for the inundation hazard without including damage caused by the earthquake itself. Calculations show that the severity of building damage in Seaside is sensitive to the magnitude of the event or degree of slip because the majority of the city is located on low-lying coastal land within the estimated inundation zone. For the events modeled, the percentage of building within the inundation zone ranges from 9 to 88 %, with average direct economic losses ranging from $2 million to $1.2 billion. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

16917,"Development of limit states for seismic fragility assessment of piloti-type structures verified with observed damage data Limit states have been widely used as a threshold for classifying and evaluating building damage states either analytically or empirically, and current guidelines or codes generally provide the limit state as interstory drift ratio (IDR) for a single lateral-load resisting system. However, piloti-type structures in Korea have a vertically irregular system consisting of a moment frame for parking lots at the first story and a shear wall system for residential space at upper stories, making it difficult to evaluate the damage states against earthquakes using existing limit states. In this regard, new limit states for the typical piloti-type building structures were developed to evaluate the damage states probabilistically via seismic fragility assessments and verified with observed damage data using a damage probability estimator (DPE). The DPE was introduced as a probabilistic damage measure available from both analytical and empirical ways. First, a prototype model for the typical piloti-type structures damaged during the 2017 Pohang earthquake was proposed to simulate seismic demands in terms of both IDR and concrete strain. Second, strain-based limit states were examined and determined to use as an alternative to the existing IDR-based limit states. Finally, the new IDR-based limit states were developed on the basis of correlation between IDR and concrete strain to reflect local damage under vertical irregularity. The results revealed that the new IDR-based limit states were determined as approximately 30% reduction from the existing IDR-based limit states and the feasibility of the new limit states was validated with the observed damage data obtained from the 2017 Pohang earthquake. The seismic fragility function updated based on the new limit state could estimate more reliable damage states of the piloti-type residential buildings.

16937,"Development of seismic fragility surfaces for reinforced concrete buildings by means of nonlinear time-history analysis Fragility curves are generally developed using a single parameter to relate the level of shaking to the expected structural damage. The main goal of this work is to use several parameters to characterize the earthquake ground motion. The fragility curves will, therefore, become surfaces when the ground motion is represented by two parameters. To this end, the roles of various strong-motion parameters on the induced damage in the structure are compared through nonlinear time-history numerical calculations. A robust structural model that can be used to perform numerous nonlinear dynamic calculations, with an acceptable cost, is adopted. The developed model is based on the use of structural elements with concentrated nonlinear damage mechanics and plasticity-type behavior. The relations between numerous ground-motion parameters, characterizing different aspects of the shaking, and the computed damage are analyzed and discussed. Natural and synthetic accelerograms were chosen/computed based on a consideration of the magnitude-distance ranges of design earthquakes. A complete methodology for building fragility surfaces based on the damage calculation through nonlinear numerical analysis of multi-degree-of-freedom systems is proposed. The fragility surfaces are built to represent the probability that a given damage level is reached (or exceeded) for any given level of ground motion characterized by the two chosen parameters. The results show that an increase from one to two ground-motion parameters leads to a significant reduction in the scatter in the fragility analysis and allows the uncertainties related to the effect of the second ground-motion parameter to be accounted for within risk assessments.

13478,"Simulating storm surge waves for structural vulnerability estimation and flood hazard mapping Wave action during storm surge is a common cause of building damage and therefore a critical consideration when estimating structural vulnerability and mapping flood risk. Traditional depth-damage curves, however, relate building vulnerability solely to inundation depth and therefore neglect an important damage mechanism. Similarly, flood mapping studies typically emphasize expected inundation rather than wave conditions. In this study, we consider the impact of wave effects on vulnerability estimation and flood mapping using a pair of hydrodynamic models (ADCIRC + SWAN and BOUSS1D) to simulate inland storm surge flooding. The models are used to simulate flooding in a heavily impacted coastal community (Ortley Beach, New Jersey) during Hurricane Sandy (2012) and to estimate inland hazard parameters characterizing inundation, wave and velocity effects. To quantify structural vulnerability, fragility curves are developed by statistically relating the simulated hazard parameters to surveyed building damage. The results indicate that dynamic hazard characteristics such as significant wave height are the dominant predictors of severe structural damage. The flood simulation is also used to map the variation of surge and wave effects in the community. Comparing this analysis to flood zones delineated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map reveals severe wave action and building damage in a significant portion of the community deemed least exposed to flood impact. It is suspected that this misrepresentation of risk resulted from overconfidence in the performance of the community’s frontal dune under severe surge and wave actions. © 2017, The Author(s).

20698,"Seismic fragility for Italian RC buildings based on damage data of the last 50 years A set of about 25,000 residential reinforced concrete (RC) buildings has been investigated in this study to define fragility curves. The sample originates from a wide database, reported in the online Da.D.O. (Database of Observed Damage) platform, related to about 320,000 buildings inspected in the aftermath of the nine most devastating earthquakes occurred in Italy between 1976 and 2012 (Friuli 1976; Irpinia 1980; Abruzzo 1984; Umbria-Marche 1997; Pollino 1998; Molise 2002; Emilia 2003; L’Aquila 2009; Emilia 2012). The coherence of data has been guaranteed by a thorough critical analysis among all databases. Then a refined procedure dealing with the completeness of survey campaigns at Municipality level has been applied to avoid biases in fragility fitting. The final sample is then subdivided in different structural design types, determined as a function of the evolution of seismic classification for investigated areas and the sequence of technical codes enforced through the years. The available shakemaps in terms of PGA values, derived by National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, are used to characterize seismic ground motion at buildings’ site. The opportunity of enriching the sample of data with undamaged supplementary buildings, located in areas very far from epicenter but missing in the database (only because survey inspections were not required) is deeply discussed and investigated. Finally, according to such a set of data, different classes of buildings representative of existing RC building portfolio in Italy are defined and relevant vulnerability and fragility curves are determined. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

22237,"Vulnerability assessment of buildings exposed to seismically-induced landslides, liquefaction and tsunamis There is an increasing requirement for effective evaluation, management and mitigation of the seismic risk of buildings and infrastructures considering not only the seismic ground shaking itself but also some of the most destructive collateral hazards associated with earthquakes, namely landslides, liquefaction and tsunami. In this respect an analytical vulnerability assessment methodology is proposed for buildings subjected to earthquake induced phenomena like landslides, liquefaction and tsunamis. The methodology is based on the use of nonlinear static analyses of representative structural typologies of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings. The proposed methodology results in the development of probabilistic fragility curves and vulnerability indices as function of the permanent ground displacement or the maximum ground acceleration for the landslide hazard, the differential displacements for the liquefaction hazard while the inundation depth is selected as intensity measure for the tsunami case. The proposed fragility functions could be used within a probabilistic risk assessment framework to assess the vulnerability of RC buildings exposed to different seismically induced hazards. © 2019 Associazione Geotecnica Italiana, Rome, Italy.

16931,"Development of seismic fragility curves for low-rise masonry infilled reinforced concrete buildings by a coefficient-based method This study presents a seismic fragility analysis and ultimate spectral displacement assessment of regular low-rise masonry infilled (MI) reinforced concrete (RC) buildings using a coefficient-based method. The coefficient-based method does not require a complicated finite element analysis; instead, it is a simplified procedure for assessing the spectral acceleration and displacement of buildings subjected to earthquakes. A regression analysis was first performed to obtain the best-fitting equations for the inter-story drift ratio (IDR) and period shift factor of low-rise MI RC buildings in response to the peak ground acceleration of earthquakes using published results obtained from shaking table tests. Both spectral acceleration- and spectral displacement-based fragility curves under various damage states (in terms of IDR) were then constructed using the coefficient-based method. Finally, the spectral displacements of low-rise MI RC buildings at the ultimate (or nearcollapse) state obtained from this paper and the literature were compared. The simulation results indicate that the fragility curves obtained from this study and other previous work correspond well. Furthermore, most of the spectral displacements of low-rise MI RC buildings at the ultimate state from the literature fall within the bounded spectral displacements predicted by the coefficient-based method. © 2013 Institute of Engineering Mechanics, China Earthquake Administration and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. fragility analysis  masonry  seismic  spectral displacement Concrete buildings  Earthquakes  Regression analysis  Reinforced concrete  Fragility analysis  Inter-story drift ratios  masonry  Peak ground acceleration  seismic  Seismic fragility analysis  Seismic fragility curves  Spectral displacement  Finite element method",Development of seismic fragility curves for low-rise masonry infilled reinforced concrete buildings by a coefficient-based method,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25751716648346096,0.053723708451275616,0.04338241565981531,0.021098719088514337,Analytical

22239,"Vulnerability assessment of container cranes under stochastic wind loading Container cranes, an essential component in any seaport facility system, are highly susceptible to failure during natural disasters such as severe windstorms. Damage or collapse of these structures can lead to significant amount of economic loss in terms of both repair or replacement and downtime. To study how various parameters such as boom position, yaw angle, gradient height and gradient wind speed affect the failure vulnerability of a crane, in this work, a representative container crane has been modelled in a commercial software considering both material and geometric nonlinearities. Stochastic wind fields are simulated as a stationary process by means of the spectral representation method using power spectrum in conjunction with along- and across-wind coherence functions. Wind fields are also simulated as a non-stationary stochastic process utilising the modulation functions from the available literature to consider the situations of thunderstorm downbursts. Nonlinear time history analyses are then performed and a few responses are compared for stationary and non-stationary wind field cases. It is observed that for the given simulation parameters, the responses considering stationary wind fields are larger than those of the non-stationary wind fields. Failure vulnerability of the crane is then assessed in terms of fragility curves. The results of this study show that the failure vulnerability may not be maximum for the set of parameter values for which the aerodynamic forces are maximum. This study provides a better understanding of crane vulnerability that may be utilised to achieve a better crane design. container crane  fragility curves  nonlinear analysis  stochastic wind field  non-stationary wind field  vulnerability assessment STEEL HIGHWAY BRIDGES  SEISMIC FRAGILITY  SIMULATION  SPECTRUM  CURVES  MULTIVARIATE  BUILDINGS  MODEL",Vulnerability assessment of container cranes under stochastic wind loading,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4670984543552746,0.008107124818881354,0.015995409898825842,0.012520901641986487,Analytical
15208,"A multilevel procedure at urban scale to assess the vulnerability and the exposure of residential masonry buildings: The case study of pordenone, northeast italy More than the 60% of the Italian residential building stock had already been built by 1974, when seismic codes were enforced on a minimal part of the country. Unreinforced masonry buildings represent most of that share, but they are typical for each region, in terms of both materials and structural configurations. The definition of ‘regional’, i.e., more specific, vulnerability and exposure models are required to improve existing forecast models. The research presents a new geographic information system (GIS)-based multilevel procedure for earthquake disaster prevention planning at urban scale; it includes multicriteria analysis, such as architectural types, structural vulnerability analysis, microzonation studies, and socio-economic aspects. The procedure has been applied to the municipality of Pordenone (PN), a district town of the Friuli–Venezia–Giulia region, in Northeast Italy. To assess the urban seismic risk, more than 5000 masonry residential buildings were investigated and common types within sub-municipal areas and exposure data were collected. Simplified mechanical analysis provided a ‘regional’ vulnerability model through typological fragility curves. The integration of results into GIS tool permitted the definition of cross-mapping among vulnerability, damage scenarios (conditional and unconditional) and exposure (seismic losses, casualties, impact), with respect to various earthquake intensities expected in the town. These results are presented at different scales: from the single building, to submunicipal area and to the entire town. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

20717,"Seismic fragility of Italian RC precast industrial structures Despite the moderate ground motions observed during the seismic events in Northern Italy, May 2012, reinforced concrete (RC) precast industrial buildings suffered excessive damage, which led to substantial direct and indirect losses. The aim of this paper is to present a seismic fragility model for Italian RC precast buildings, to be used in earthquake loss estimation and seismic risk assessment. An analytical methodology has been used that consists of (1) random sampling of one hundred structures for each building typology, (2) pushover analysis to establish a number of damage limit states, (3) execution of nonlinear dynamic analysis and comparison of the maximum demand with the limit state capacity to allocate the structure in a damage state, and (4) regression analysis on the cumulative percentage of buildings in each damage state for a set of intensity measure levels to derive the statistical parameters of the fragility functions. The building population employed in the analysis was generated considering both material and geometric variability that was obtained from the field surveys of 650 industrial facilities, as well as other information available in the literature. Several aspects of the fragility derivation process were further analysed, such as the correlation between different intensity measure types and damage, the consideration of different collapse mechanisms (e.g. beam-column connection failure) and the differences in the resulting fragility curves when adopting a 2D or a 3D modelling environment.

Traditional seismic designs rely on the assumption that the base of the foundation is fixed. However, the foundation tends to displace owing to the flexible nature of the soil. Indian seismic code and other codes though incorporate the effect of soil-structure-interaction (SSI), but in a very broad sense, and thus are inadequate. This study aims to understand the seismic performance of reinforced concrete (RC) framed buildings designed according to the Indian code, considering soil flexibility. The seismic vulnerability of buildings is investigated through pushover and fragility analysis. Six RC framed buildings with different heights, encompassing low-, mid- and high-rise buildings, covering a wide range of lateral periods (short-, medium- and long-periods), are considered. These buildings are considered to be resting on raft foundations. The soil flexibility for four types of soft clay soil is computed based on shear velocity, shear modulus and density. A variational study for a range of soft soils in combination with short-, medium- and long-period structures is carried out. Fragility curves and damage probability matrices are developed using push over analysis incorporating SSI. The overall conclusions from the fragility curves are that the soil flexibility may significantly increase the seismic vulnerability of low-rise RC framed buildings, and the performance of high-rise buildings may be improved by taking this into consideration. © 2019, © 2019 International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering (IABSE). flexible base  fragility curve  reinforced concrete  seismic performance  seismic vulnerability Clay  Earthquakes  Seismic design  Seismic waves  Shear flow  Soil structure interactions  Tall buildings  Damage probability matrices  Flexible base  Fragility curves  High rise building  Long-period structure  Push-over analysis  Seismic Performance  Seismic vulnerability  Reinforced concrete",Effect of Soil Flexibility on Seismic Fragility of Code-Designed Reinforced Concrete Framed Buildings,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47167767955114825,0.018310527008761093,0.02953778744058959,0.008062109308670027,Analytical
18134,"Further development of FLEMOps for the modelling of damage to residential buildings due to high groundwater levels Severe damage due to high groundwater levels occurred during and after the 2002 flood in the city of Dresden, Germany. So far, damage caused by high groundwater levels has rarely been considered in flood risk analysis. However, reliable damage models are necessary to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of mitigation measures and to support a comprehensive risk management. Therefore, the Flood Loss Estimation Model for the private sector FLEMOps was further developed for modelling damage due to high groundwater levels. FLEMOps is empirically based and considers several damage influencing factors. In addition to the water depth, information on the building type as well as the level of precaution and contamination are also taken into account. FLEMOps for groundwater flooding has been successfully validated at the micro- and meso-scale and a sensitivity analysis has been implemented in Dresden.

21830,"The probabilistic flood damage model for residential buildings - BN-FLEMOps Flood risk analyses and particularly estimates of flood loss are often associated with a high degree of uncertainty. Deterministic models are unable to reflect and account for these uncertainties, or they are only able to do this to a very limited extent. This study presents the probabilistic flood loss estimation model for the private sector BN-FLEMOps remove. Taking the 2002 flood at the Mulde river as an example, the BN-FLEMOps is compared with a model ensemble of established flood loss models and the advantages of probabilistic models for decision-making under uncertainty are discussed. Furthermore, the implementation of the model in the OASIS Loss Modeling Framework (LMF) is described, which enables its easy application. The validation at the Mulde river shows that the median loss estimates by the BN-FLEMOps are closer to the observed loss in 12 out of 19 municipalities in comparison with the ensemble median. The spread of the BN-FLEMOps generated probability density function coincides with the range of the ensemble member estimates in most municipalities. The BN-FLEMOps with its probabilistic approach is therefore well-suited to reliably quantify uncertainties in flood loss modeling and to serve decision-makers as a comprehensive source of information.

18101,"Fragility-based performance evaluation of mid-rise reinforced concrete frames in near field and far field earthquakes Available records of recent earthquakes show that near-field earthquakes have different characteristics than far-field earthquakes. In general, most of these unique characteristics of near-fault records can be attributed to their forward directivity. This phenomenon causes the records of ground motion normal to the fault to entail pulses with long periods in the velocity time history. The energy of the earthquake is almost accumulated in these pulses causing large displacements and, accordingly, severe damages in the building. Damage to structures caused by past earthquakes raises the need to assess the chance of future earthquake damage. There are a variety of methods to evaluate building seismic vulnerabilities with different computational cost and accuracy. In the meantime, fragility curves, which defines the possibility of structural damage as a function of ground motion characteristics and design parameters, are more common. These curves express the percentage of probability that the structural response will exceed the allowable performance limit at different seismic intensities. This study aims to obtain the fragility curve for low- and mid-rise structures of reinforced concrete moment frames by incremental dynamic analysis (IDA). These frames were exposed to an ensemble of 18 ground motions (nine records near-faults and nine records far-faults). Finally, after the analysis, their fragility curves are obtained using the limit states provided by HAZUS-MH 2.1. The result shows the near-fault earthquakes can drastically influence the fragility curves of the 6-story building while it has a minimal impact on those of the 3-story building.

21717,"Testing and modeling of hurricane wind-driven rain water ingress, propagation, and subsequent interior damage in residential buildings Hurricanes are a main cause of economic losses in the world, including Florida. They affect exterior, interior, and the contents of residential buildings. The interior damage can be as much as half of the cost of total damage, but the estimation of the interior damage is still somewhat crude. Most damage models estimate interior damage as a percentage of the exterior damage, or through simple relationships, that relate the height of water ingress in the building to the interior damage. This paper presents a new model for interior and contents damage estimations, which takes into account the physical mechanisms of hurricane-induced interior and contents damage from rainwater ingress. The method incorporates the results of large and full-scale tests to quantify the rainwater propagation and distribution from component to component in the interior of the building, and combines the test results with estimates of water resistance characteristics of the building interior and contents, and with cost analyses. The model is part of the commercial residential low-rise vulnerability model of the Florida Public Hurricane Loss Model (FPHLM).

21200,"Seismic vulnerability assessment to earthquake at urban scale: A case of Mostaganem city in Algeria The focus of this study was the seismic vulnerability assessment of buildings constituting Mostaganem city in Algeria. Situated 320 km to the west of Algiers, Mostaganem city encompasses a valuable cultural and architectural built heritage. The city has suffered several moderate earthquakes in recent years; this has led to extensive structural damage to old structures, especially unreinforced historical buildings. This study was divided into two essential steps, the first step being to establish fragility curves based on a non-linear static pushover analysis for each typology and height of buildings. Twenty-seven pushover analyses were performed by means of SAP2000 software (three analyses for each type of building). The second step was to adopt the US HAZUS software and to modify it to suit the typical setting and parameters of the city of Mostaganem. A seismic vulnerability analysis of Mostaganem city was conducted using HAZUS software after inputting the new parameters of the fragility curves established within the first step. The results indicated that the number of poor-quality buildings expected to be totally destroyed under a 5.5 Mw earthquake scenario could reach more than 28 buildings. Three percent of unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings were completely damaged and 10% were extensively damaged. Of the concrete frame buildings, 6% were extensively damaged and 19% were moderately damaged. According to the built year, 6% of both concrete frame and URM buildings built before 1980 are estimated to be collapsing. Buildings constructed between 1980 and 1999 are more resistant; 8% of those structures were extensively damaged and 18% were moderately damaged. Only 10% of buildings constructed after 1999 were moderately damaged. The results also show that the main hospital of the city, built before 1960, will be extensively damaged during an earthquake of 5.5 Mw. The number of human casualties could reach several hundreds - 10.5% of residents of URM buildings are injured or dead. Compared with the URM buildings, concrete frame buildings have lower casualty rates of 1.5% and 0.5% for those built before and after 1980, respectively. It was concluded that Mostaganem city belongs to seismic vulnerable zones in Algeria; in this regard, an action plan is needed for the rehabilitation of old constructions. In addition, the effectiveness of establishing and introducing new and appropriate fragility curves was demonstrated. © 2018. The Authors.

18628,"Investigation of the Geometric Variation Effect on Seismic Performance of Low-Rise Unreinforced Masonry Structures Through Fragility Analysis Seismic risk assessment of unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings is an important process for seismic retrofit of essential facilities located in the central and southern United States (CSUS), as more than 30 % of facilities there are low-rise URM buildings. Although HAZUS, the current loss estimation package for natural hazards, provides a set of fragility curves for such structures as an essential tool for conducting seismic risk assessment, seismic performance level variation due to geometric characteristics is not explicitly considered. This study investigates the effect of geometric variation of low-rise URM structures on seismic fragility assessment. Utilizing URM building inventory information within the CSUS region, variables that describe the physical shape of URM structures are identified. A simplified composite spring model developed for URM structures is then utilized to monitor nonlinear seismic behavior. Finally, seismic fragility curves corresponding to various shape configurations of URM structures are developed and compared. The analysis confirms that the length of out-of-plane walls and the number of stories in URM buildings have significant effects on seismic risk. An increase in the wall length or the number of stories makes URM buildings more vulnerable. On the other hand, the perforation ratio does not significantly affect seismic performance. It is suggested that using a single set of fragility curves is not adequate for seismic risk assessment of low-rise URM buildings unless geometric variation is considered explicitly. In addition, comparing the fragility curves developed in this study with HAZUS data, it is clear that the seismic vulnerability of low-rise URM is underestimated in HAZUS for lower limit states and overestimated for higher limit states. © 2016, Iran University of Science and Technology.

22053,"Uncertainties in seismic response of a torsional irregular structure Torsional effects may significantly modify the seismic response of asymmetric buildings. This is due to the influence of several complex and difficult parameters to apprehend. The present paper deals with the influence of the input parameters on the seismic response of an asymmetric structure. Thus, several nonlinear dynamic analyses are performed in order to evaluate the effects of torsion on the seismic response of an asymmetric structure and shown their preponderances. The importance of the uncertain characteristics of the input seismic motion on the structural damage and the sensitivity of the response to the input parameters are assessed by a probabilistic analysis. The influence of these parameters is quantified through the use of partial correlation coefficient (PCC). The response in terms of roof displacement is calculated and used to construct fragility curves in order to quantify the probability of different damage levels according to the input motion. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. asymmetric buildings  earthquakes  non-linear behaviour  time history analysis  Torsion effects  uncertainty  vulnerability curves Damage detection  Earthquakes  Seismic response  Structural analysis  Torsional stress  Asymmetric buildings  Time history analysis  Torsion effect  uncertainty  vulnerability curves  Uncertainty analysis",Uncertainties in seismic response of a torsional irregular structure,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1686376824415369,0.03236483339967328,0.01548218141307711,0.07410756513063749,Analytical

20188,"Risk-targeted hazard maps for Spain Many studies have demonstrated that the design of structures in a region through the uniform hazard principle does not guarantee a uniform collapse risk. Even in regions with similar Peak Ground Accelerations (PGAs) corresponding to the same mean return period, the seismic risk in terms of collapse probability will be significantly different mainly due to the shape of the hazard curves as well as uncertainties in structural capacities. In this paper, risk-targeted hazard mapping is being explored in peninsular Spain using a recently updated seismic hazard map. Since risk targeting involves multiple input parameters such as the model parameters of fragility curves, their variability was considered through their probability distribution as observed in reinforced concrete (RC) moment frame buildings, representing the most common building typology in Spain. The influence of the variation of these parameters on the risk results were investigated, and different assumptions for estimating the model parameters of fragility curves are illustrated. These assumptions were included in a fixed (generic) fragility curve or building-site-specific fragility curves. Different acceptable damage states (i.e., collapse and yielding) were considered concerning Spain’s seismicity level. Finally, the maps for risk-targeted design ground motions and risk coefficients are presented. It is outlined that the employment of risk-targeted analysis leads to the modifications for existing design ground motions due to the different shape of the hazard curves across Spain and considering the uncertainty of structural capacity. Moreover, it is found that using the building- and site-specific fragility curves could result in a more uniform seismic risk across the country. © 2021, The Author(s).

Different approaches have been employed so far to estimate earthquake casualties and damage. This paper describe the basic concept for development of analytical vulnerability functions based essentially on so called damage model which was performed from probabilistic studies on seismic capacity of existing buildings in the city of Algiers (Algeria).

19808,"Probabilistic seismic risk evaluation of reinforced concrete buildings The main objective of this article is to propose a simplified methodology to assess the expected seismic damage in reinforced concrete buildings from a probabilistic point of view by using Monte Carlo simulation. In order to do so, the seismic behaviour of the building was studied by using random capacity obtained by considering the mechanical properties of the materials as random variables. From the capacity curves, the damage states and fragility curves can be obtained, and curves describing the expected seismic damage to the structure as a function of a seismic hazard characteristic can be developed. The latter can be calculated using the capacity spectrum and the demand spectrum according to the methodology proposed by the Risk-UE project. In order to define the seismic demand as a random variable, a set of real accelerograms were obtained from European and Spanish databases in such a way that the mean of their elastic response spectra was similar to an elastic response spectrum selected from Eurocode 8. In order to combine the uncertainties associated with the seismic action and the mechanical properties of materials, two procedures are considered to obtain functions relating the peak ground acceleration to the maximum spectral displacements. The first method is based on a series of non-linear dynamic analyses, while the second is based on the well-known ATC-40 procedure called equal displacement approximation. After applying both procedures, the probability density functions of the maximum displacement at the roof of the building are gathered and compared. The expected structural damage is finally obtained by replacing the spectral displacement calculated using ATC-40 and the incremental dynamic procedure. In the damage functions, the results obtained from incremental static and dynamic analyses are compared and discussed from a probabilistic point of view. © ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.

17163,"Economic and Human Loss Empirical Models for Earthquakes in the Mediterranean Region, with Particular Focus on Algeria In this study, loss estimation models were developed for reasonably accurate assessment of economic and human losses from seismic events in the Mediterranean region, based on damage assessment at an urban scale. Data were compiled from existing worldwide databases, and completed with earthquake information from regional studies. Economic data were converted to a single common currency unit (2015 USD value) and the wealth of the areas affected by 65 earthquakes of the region from 1900 to 2015 was assessed. Reduced-form models were used to determine economic and human losses, with earthquake magnitude and intensity as hazard-related variables, and gross domestic product of the affected area and the affected population as exposure-related variables. Damage to buildings was also used as a hazard-related variable to predict economic and human losses. Finally, site-specific regression models were proposed for economic and human losses due to earthquakes in the Mediterranean region, and more specifically, in Algeria. We show that by introducing the damage variable into the models, prediction error can be reduced, and that accuracy of loss model estimation is site dependent and requires regional data on earthquake losses to improve. A case study for Constantine, Algeria shows the improvements needed for increased accuracy. © 2017, The Author(s).

Then, a series of nonlinear dynamic and static time history analyses are performed with the aid of finite element analysis considering a reference building located at varying distances from the slope's crest.

18221,"HAZUS-MH hurricane model methodology. I: Hurricane hazard, terrain, and wind load modeling An overview of the hurricane hazard model, terrain model, wind pressure, and windborne debris models used in the HAZUS-MH hurricane model is presented. These models represent the first three of five major component models used in HAZUS for the prediction of damage and loss to buildings subjected to hurricanes. The five model components are the hurricane hazard model, terrain model, wind load model, physical damage model, and loss model. These models have been validated, wherever possible, through the use of historical data for landfalling hurricanes, wind tunnel test results, field observations of hurricane induced damage and insurance loss data. The HAZUS hurricane model represents an advancement in the state-of-the-art over other hurricane loss prediction models in that it estimates wind induced loads, building response, damage and loss, rather than simply using historical loss data to model loss as a function of wind speed. © ASCE.

22170,"Using the Conditional Spectrum Method for Improved Fragility Assessment of Concrete Gravity Dams in Eastern Canada The accurate estimation of fragility functions requires the proper selection of ground motion records at different intensity levels. However, most of the available fragility assessments of concrete dams use the same records at all intensity levels and often selects them with an inadequate target spectrum. In order to improve the fragility assessment of such structures, this paper proposes the use of records selected with the Conditional Spectrum (CS) method within a multiple stripes analysis. The approach is applied to a dam in Eastern Canada, and a comparison with the methodology used by other studies is done. It is shown that the approach proposed herein allows for the reduction of the seismic response and fragility of the dam. Moreover, the uncertainty related to material properties becomes less significant when using the CS method, and the fragility curves could be reasonably estimated by considering the ground motions as the only source of uncertainty.

20049,"Reliability based vulnerability modelling of metal-clad industrial buildings to extreme wind loading for cyclonic regions This paper presents an approach for developing a vulnerability model to predict the probability and extent of damage to metal-clad industrial buildings due to extreme wind loading. Structural reliability-based methods that describe the spatially distributed wind load and component/connection strengths probabilistically are used in the model. Two failure mechanisms are considered for the roof envelop, namely; failure of roof cladding, and purlin failure. Interdependency between the failure mechanisms, load sharing effects due to connection/component failure, and internal pressure variation due to roof cladding failure are also considered. The industrial building examined in the study is a hot rolled structural steel, metal-clad, gable-end building designed for cyclonic regions in Australia. The likelihood and extent of roof damage for this buildings is presented using wind vulnerability curves obtained from the probabilistic model. It is found that internal pressure (e.g. an open door) and the use of cyclone washers has a significant effect on wind vulnerability. The utilisation of cyclone washers is found to reduce damage risks by over 70%.

Component failure fragility curves have been derived following experiments on typical NZ suspended ceilings, considering loading in tension, compression and shear. A simple method to analyse perimeter-fixed ceilings using peak floor acceleration (PFA) is described, allowing for ceiling system fragility to be obtained from component fragilities. This is illustrated in an example of a 5 storey building. It was found that single rivet end-fixings and cross-tee connections were the most critical elements of the ceilings governing the system capacity. In the design examples it was shown that ceilings at different elevations of the structure showed different probabilities of failure and larger ceiling areas with heavier tiles were most susceptible to damage.

Based on the structural taxonomy of the territory, two different forms were defined to collect geometrical and structural data of buildings by different stakeholders (citizens and practitioners). This data was then employed to produce fragility curves using the mechanics-based procedure SP-BELA. To estimate seismic risk, the developed fragility model was combined with a hazard curve for the corresponding location. The described procedure is implemented in a WebGIS platform that allows to georeference and assess the surveyed buildings and define retrofitting strategies.

22231,"Vulnerability assessment for reinforced concrete buildings exposed to landslides The methodologies available for the analytical quantification of the vulnerability of buildings which are subject to actions resulting from slope instabilities and landslides are relatively limited in comparison with other components of quantitative landslide risk assessment. This paper provides a general methodology for calculating the vulnerabilities of reinforced concrete frame structures that are subject to three types of slope instability: slow-moving landslides, rapid flow-type slides and rockfalls. The vulnerability is expressed using sets of fragility curves. A description of the general framework and of the specialised procedures employed is presented here, separately for each landslide mechanism, through the example of a single-bay one-storey reinforced concrete frame. The properties of the frame are taken into account as variables with associated uncertainties. The derived vulnerability curves presented here can be used directly by risk assessment practitioners without having to repeat the procedure, given the expected range of landslide intensities and for similar building typologies and ranges of structural characteristics. This permits the applicability of the calculated vulnerability to a wide variety of similar frames for a range of landslide intensity parameters. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

18230,"High spatial-resolution loss estimation using dense array strong-motion near-fault records. Case study for Hveragerði and the Mw6.3 Ölfus earthquake, South Iceland The most recent and costliest damaging earthquake in Iceland is the Mw6.3 29-May-2008 Ölfus earthquake to date. In particular, Hveragerði town located in the extreme near-fault region, suffered intense horizontal peak ground accelerations (PGA) of ∼ 40–90%g and large amplitude and long-period near-fault pulses, recorded on a dense urban strong-motion array in the town. In this study we collated a high-spatial resolution exposure database (building-by-building) complete with actual reported losses and classified the buildings by building materials and construction year according to the code design requirements in place at the time. We took advantage of the array data and evaluated a set of well-known ground motion intensity measures (IM), including PGA, pseudo-acceleration response spectra at short-to-long periods, Arias Intensity and Cumulative Absolute Velocity. We applied empirical Bayesian kriging geostatistical analyses to generate high-resolution shakemaps and provide IM estimates for each building. The shakemaps showed a significant and systematic variation of the IMs across the small study area, with the lowest ground motions observed centrally and highest values in the outskirts. Furthermore, correlation analysis was carried out for the damage ratio and the exposure data IMs, but only low-to-moderate correlations were observed. A key reason is the incurred losses were primarily due to damage to non-structural components, to which the code design requirements do not apply. We carried out a seismic loss assessment in Hveragerði for the earthquake scenario of the Ölfus earthquake both on building-by-building, and municipality levels of spatial resolution. We applied both local and global fragility models associated with detail building typologies identified based on the SERA taxonomy scheme. The results show that the global fragility functions severely underestimate the seismic performance of the building stock, except for one-story reinforced concrete buildings, while overall the masonry buildings were associated with the most predicted and observed losses. On the other hand, the local models predicted losses that conformed well with the observed damages to timber and concrete buildings. The high-spatial-resolution predictions of losses gave results that better correlated with the observed losses in most typologies.

20604,"Seismic fragility and collapse probability of Italian precast reinforced concrete industrial structures In May 2012 the earthquakes in Northern Italy revealed the seismic vulnerability of typical Italian precast industrial buildings. Nevertheless there are only few fragility models capable of characterizing the seismic behaviour of reinforced concrete (RC) precast structures compared with the large amount of studies on residential buildings. In this paper the vulnerability of such structures was estimated developing fragility curves. An analytical methodology was followed making use of nonlinear dynamic analysis performed on a building stock representative of the existing Italian population to obtain the distribution of buildings in each defined damage states for increasing intensity levels of the seismic action. The consideration of beam-column connection failure, different modelling hypothesis and the differences in the resulting fragility curves when adopting a two- or three-dimensional modelling environment were also analysed. It has been found that the choice of a simplified dynamic analysis that does not consider vertical acceleration could be inadequate for the representation of the connection failure. Therefore a discussion of the sensitivity of the collapse fragility curves to the modelling assumptions is presented. The fragility curves were then applied in the derivation of the annual probability of collapse of RC precast industrial buildings located in Northern and Eastern Tuscany. © Civil-Comp Press, 2014.

16848,"Development and assessment of uni- and multivariable flood loss models for Emilia-Romagna (Italy) Flood loss models are one important source of uncertainty in flood risk assessments. Many countries experience sparseness or absence of comprehensive high-quality flood loss data, which is often rooted in a lack of protocols and reference procedures for compiling loss datasets after flood events. Such data are an important reference for developing and validating flood loss models. We consider the Secchia River flood event of January 2014, when a sudden levee breach caused the inundation of nearly 52 km2 in northern Italy. After this event local authorities collected a comprehensive flood loss dataset of affected private households including building footprints and structures and damages to buildings and contents. The dataset was enriched with further information compiled by us, including economic building values, maximum water depths, velocities and flood durations for each building. By analyzing this dataset we tackle the problem of flood damage estimation in Emilia-Romagna (Italy) by identifying empirical uni- and multivariable loss models for residential buildings and contents. The accuracy of the proposed models is compared with that of several flood damage models reported in the literature, providing additional insights into the transferability of the models among different contexts. Our results show that (1) even simple univariable damage models based on local data are significantly more accurate than literature models derived for different contexts; (2) multivariable models that consider several explanatory variables outperform univariable models, which use only water depth. However, multivariable models can only be effectively developed and applied if sufficient and detailed information is available. © Author(s) 2018.

20164,"Risk assessment in quantification of hurricane resilience of residential communities This paper proposes a framework to evaluate hurricane resilience of residential communities. Building resilience often refers to community resilience instead of individual resilience. Few efforts have been made to relate individual resilience to community resilience in a quantitative manner subjected to hurricane events. The proposed framework includes disaggregating hurricane community resilience to the individual level and quantifying the resilience for individual residential buildings. The framework not only consists of hurricane damage assessment including hurricane fragility analysis, reliability analysis, and loss analysis, but also analysis of recovery time, which makes the assessment framework more comprehensive and accurate. Sources of uncertainties in the framework include (1) structural modeling uncertainty (e.g., changes in roof panel resistance due to effects of corrosion on metal fasteners), (2) load uncertainty (e.g., hurricane wind characteristics), (3) uncertainty in direct and indirect loss estimation, and (4) recovery time modeling uncertainty. It is found that a community could meet certain community resilience goals as long as the individual buildings in the community could meet the individual building resilience goals. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

18072,"Fragility functions for seismic risk in regions with moderate seismicity Current seismic risk evaluations are mostly based on approximate vulnerability curves. Damage prediction is improved by considering structural characteristics of building. Such improved fragility functions do not exist for many structures, especially in countries with moderate seismicity. Typical structures of these regions, such as unreinforced masonry buildings URM, differ notably from structures usually considered in seismic risk. Due to low perceived seismic hazard, these types of structures have not been adequately investigated. Moreover, experimental investigations have shown that their deformation capacity is often underestimated. As a consequence, advanced methodologies have not yet been developed. This paper describes the results obtained with an analytical displacement-based methodology to assess the seismic risk in existing buildings through fragility functions. The study is based on URM existing buildings, common in North Western Europe. These low or mid-rise buildings with basements generally do not have significant structural plan irregularities. The impact and the accuracy of several parameters (such as the damage grade definition, the prediction of the ultimate drift, and the strength of the walls) are addressed.

15032,"A Bayesian network approach for multi-sectoral flood damage assessment and multi-scenario analysis Extreme weather and climate related events, from river flooding to droughts and tropical cyclones, are likely to become both more severe and more frequent in the coming decades, and the damages caused by these events will be felt across all sectors of society. In the face of this threat, policy- and decision-makers are increasingly calling for new approaches and tools to support risk management and climate adaptation pathways that can capture the full extent of the impacts. In this frame, a GIS-based Bayesian Network (BN) approach is presented for the capturing and modelling of multi-sectoral flooding damages against future ‘what-if’ scenarios. Building on a risk-based conceptual framework, the BN model was trained and validated by exploiting data collected from the 2014 Secchia River flooding event, as well as other contextual variables. Moreover, a novel approach to defining the structure of the BN was performed, reconfiguring the model according to expert judgment and data-based validation. The model showed a good predictive capacity for damages in the agricultural, industrial and residential sectors, predicting the severity of damages with a classification accuracy of about 60% for each of these assessment endpoints. ‘What-if’ scenario analysis was performed to understand the potential impacts of future changes in i) land use patterns and ii) increasing flood depths resulting from more severe flood events. The output of the model showed a rising probability of experiencing high monetary damages under both scenarios. In spite of constraints within the case study dataset, the results of the appraisal show good promise, and together with the designed BN model itself represent a valuable support for disaster risk management and reduction actions against extreme river flooding events, enabling better informed decision making. © 2022 The Author(s) Climate adaptation  Flood risk assessment  Machine Learning  Secchia river  Sensitivity analysis None",A Bayesian network approach for multi-sectoral flood damage assessment and multi-scenario analysis,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0536106453973387,0.05512668640091258,0.01558221001229811,0.21600350620805303,ML
15496,"An Assessment of the Effectiveness of Tree-Based Models for Multi-Variate Flood Damage Assessment in Australia Flood is a frequent natural hazard that has significant financial consequences for Australia. In Australia, physical losses caused by floods are commonly estimated by stage-damage functions. These methods usually consider only the depth of the water and the type of buildings at risk. However, flood damage is a complicated process, and it is dependent on a variety of factors which are rarely taken into account. This study explores the interaction, importance, and influence of water depth, flow velocity, water contamination, precautionary measures, emergency measures, flood experience, floor area, building value, building quality, and socioeconomic status. The study uses tree-based models (regression trees and bagging decision trees) and a dataset collected from 2012 to 2013 flood events in Queensland, which includes information on structural damages, impact parameters, and resistance variables. The tree-based approaches show water depth, floor area, precautionary measures, building value, and building quality to be important damage-influencing parameters. Furthermore, the performance of the tree-based models is validated and contrasted with the outcomes of a multi-parameter loss function (FLFA(rs)) from Australia. The tree-based models are shown to be more accurate than the stage-damage function. Consequently, considering more parameters and taking advantage of tree-based models is recommended. The outcome is important for improving established Australian flood loss models and assisting decision-makers and insurance companies dealing with flood risk assessment. flood damage assessment  flood risk  stage-damage function  multi-variate analysis  flood loss-influencing parameters  tree-based analyses  FLFA(rs)  risk reduction NATURAL HAZARDS  RISK  VALIDATION  REGRESSION  BENEFITS  INSIGHTS  FLEMOCS  LOSSES",An Assessment of the Effectiveness of Tree-Based Models for Multi-Variate Flood Damage Assessment in Australia,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04787621224319978,0.07487355595476881,0.1266668691379477,0.05137725087729265,Hybrid
18812,"Masonry structures: A proposal of analytical generation of fragility functions for tsunami impact-Application to the Mediterranean coasts Evaluation of tsunami vulnerability of coastal buildings is gaining high interest in recent years in the areas with high tsunami hazard. Fragility evaluation is a fundamental step to obtain a quantitative estimation of the probability of building damage and in order to define possible strategies for risk mitigation. Several empirical fragility curves are available for masonry structures. However, an empirical fragility curve is generally based on field surveys after tsunami events, not always available. Conversely, analytical fragility curves are based on prediction approaches. In this paper, a proposal for the evaluation of analytical fragility curves for masonry structures typical of the Mediterranean coasts based on simplified structural analyses and damage indexes is presented. The proposal considers the uncertainties in both the structural demand and capacity probabilistically. Several Monte Carlo simulations on some masonry structure types have been carried out to evaluate the fragility related to each fixed damage state assuming the inundation depth as intensity measure. Finally, the validity of the results is discussed by comparisons with empirical fragility curves available in the literature.

In order to evaluate the structural damage in this area due to the earthquake, it is important to estimate the distribution of earthquake ground motion. However, since the number of strong ground motion records is not enough in the heavily damaged areas, it is necessary to estimate the distribution using other data sources. In this paper, the fragility curves for low-rise residential buildings were constructed using the recorded motions and the building damage data from the intensive field survey by the AIJ and CPIJ group. The fragility curves obtained were then employed to estimate the strong motion distribution in the district level for Kobe and the surrounding areas during the earthquake.

20648,"Seismic Fragility Assessment of Special Truss Moment Frames (STMF) Using the Capacity Spectrum Method Fragility curves represent the probabilities that structural damages, under various levels of seismic excitation, will exceed the specified damage states by means of earthquake intensity damage relations. Conceptual aspects related to seismic vulnerability, damage and risk evaluation are discussed first, together with a short review of the most widely used possibilities for the seismic evaluation of structures. The capacity spectrum method starting from capacity and fragility curves is then discussed. The determination of capacity curves for buildings using a non-linear structural analysis tools is then explained, together with a simplified expeditious procedure allowing the development of fragility curves. Next, the seismic risk of the special truss moment frame (STMF) systems of Tehran, the capital of Iran, is analysed in this paper using the capacity spectrum method. The seismic hazard of the studied area is described by using the reduced 5%-damped elastic response spectra. Significant damage is obtained for mid-rise and high-rise special truss moment frames with a Vierendeel middle panel, because of the buckling and early fracture of truss web members. Special truss moment frames with an X-diagonal middle segment also show a low seismic capacity leading to significant expected damage.

19967,"Real-time city-scale time-history analysis and its application in resilience-oriented earthquake emergency responses The resilience of cities has received worldwide attention. An accurate and rapid assessment of seismic damage, economic loss, and post-event repair time can provide an important reference for emergency rescue and post-earthquake recovery. Based on city-scale nonlinear time-history analysis (THA) and regional seismic loss prediction, a real-time city-scale time-history analysis method is proposed in this work. In this method, the actual ground motion records obtained from seismic stations are input into the building models of the earthquake-stricken area, and the nonlinear time-history analysis of these models is subsequently performed using a high-performance computing platform. The seismic damage to the buildings in the target region subjected to this earthquake is evaluated according to the analysis results. The economic loss and repair time of the earthquake-stricken areas are calculated using the engineering demand parameters obtained from the time-history analysis. A program named, ""Real-time Earthquake Damage Assessment using City-scale Time-history analysis"" (""RED-ACT"" for short) was developed to automatically implement the above workflow. The method proposed in this work has been applied in many earthquake events, and provides a useful reference for scientific decision making for earthquake disaster relief, which is of great significance to enhancing the resilience of earthquake-stricken areas. © 2019 by the authors.

18624,"Investigation of the effect of debris-induced damage for constructing tsunami fragility curves for buildings Catastrophe models quantify potential losses from disasters, and are used in the insurance, disaster-risk management, and engineering industries. Tsunami fragility and vulnerability curves are key components of catastrophe models, providing probabilistic links between Tsunami Intensity Measures (TIMs), damage and loss. Building damage due to tsunamis can occur due to fluid forces or debris impact; two effects which have different implications for building damage levels and failure mechanisms. However, existing fragility functions are generally derived using all available damage data for a location, regardless of whether damage was caused by fluid or debris effects. It is therefore not clear whether the inclusion of debris-induced damage introduces bias in existing functions. Furthermore, when modelling areas likely to be affected by debris (e.g., adjacent to ports), it is not possible to account for this increased likelihood of debris-induced damage using existing functions. This paper proposes a methodology to quantify the effect that debris-induced damage has on fragility and vulnerability function derivation, and subsequent loss estimates. A building-by-building damage dataset from the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami is used, together with several statistical techniques advanced in the field of fragility analysis. First, buildings are identified which are most likely to have been affected by debris from nearby ‘washed away’ buildings. Fragility functions are then derived incorporating this debris indicator parameter. The debris parameter is shown to be significant for all but the lowest damage state (“minor damage”), and functions which incorporate the debris parameter are shown to have a statistically significant better fit to the observed damage data than models which omit debris information. Finally, for a case study scenario simulated economic loss is compared for estimates from vulnerability functions which do and do not incorporate a debris term. This comparison suggests that biases in loss estimation may be introduced if not explicitly modelling debris. The proposed methodology provides a step towards allowing catastrophe models to more reliably predict the expected damage and losses in areas with increased likelihood of debris, which is of relevance for the engineering, disaster risk-reduction and insurance sectors. © 2018 by the authors.

21120,"Seismic vulnerability assessment of a widespread RC shear wall residential building located in bucharest using response surface methodology Bucharest is a densely populated city and has a high seismic risk. A major part of the city's buildings have an inadequate seismic protection level. A widespread residential building called ""Section R"" totalizing thousands apartment units in Bucharest was assessed using Response Surface Methodology. The building was designed according to a low level seismic code. Response surface meta-models were obtained selecting the parameters with the highest influence on structural response using the ""Design of experiments"". For the analyzed structure the most important uncertainties were considered the ones related to the material. Monte Carlo simulations were performed using probability distributions for the characteristic parameters of the structure. The cumulative distribution functions for the maximum interstorey drift were obtained in both longitudinal and transverse directions at various levels of peak ground acceleration.

16852,"Development and evaluation of FLFA(cs) - A new Flood Loss Function for Australian commercial structures Commercial building flood losses significantly affect the Australian economy; however, there are not many models for commercial flood damage estimation and their results are not reliable. This study has attempted to derive and develop a new model (FLFA(CS)) for estimating the magnitude of direct damage on commercial structures. The FLFA(CS) - Flood Loss Function for Australian commercial structures, was calibrated using empirical data collected from the 2013 flood in Bundaberg, Australia, and considering the inherent uncertainty in the data sample. In addition, the newly derived model has been validated using a K-fold cross-validation procedure. The model performance has also been compared with the Flood Loss Estimation MOdel for the commercial sector (FLEMOCS) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) damage functions from overseas, as well as the ANUFLOOD damage model from Australia. The validation procedure shows very good results for FLFA(CS), performance (no bias and only five per cent mean absolute error). It also shows that ANUFLOOD, as Australia's most prevalently used commercial loss estimation model, is still subject to very high uncertainty. Hence, there is an immediate need for a project to build new depth damage functions for commercial and industrial properties. Awareness of these issues is important for strategic decision-making in flood risk reduction and it could amplify the cognition of decision-makers and insurance companies about flood risk assessment in Australia.

13529,"The effect of structural variability and local site conditions on building fragility functions In this study, the effect of local site conditions (site class and site amplifications) and structural variability are investigated on fragility functions of typical building structures. The study area is chosen as Eastern Turkey. The fragility functions are developed using site-specific uniform hazard spectrum (UHS). The site-specific UHS is obtained based on simulated ground motions. The implementation of ground motion simulation into seismic hazard assessment has the advantage of investigating detailed local site effects. The typical residential buildings in Erzincan are represented by equivalent single degree of freedom systems (ESDOFs). Predictive equations are accomplished for structural seismic demands of ESDOFs to derive fragility functions in a straightforward manner. To study the sensitivity of fragility curves to site class, two sites on soft and stiff soil are taken into account. Two alternative site amplification functions known as generic and theoretical site amplifications are examined for these two sites. The reinforced concrete frames located on soft soil display larger fragilities than those on stiff soil. Theoretical site amplification mostly leads to larger fragilities than generic site amplification more evidently for reinforced concrete buildings. Additionally, structural variability of ESDOFs is generally observed to increase the fragility especially for rigid structural models. © 2018 Techno-Press, Ltd.

18153,"Gaussian Process Regression-Based Structural Response Model and Its Application to Regional Damage Assessment Seismic activities are serious disasters that induce natural hazards resulting in an incalculable amount of damage to properties and millions of deaths. Typically, seismic risk assessment can be performed by means of structural damage information computed based on the maximum displacement of the structure. In this study, machine learning models based on GPR are developed in order to estimate the maximum displacement of the structures from seismic activities and then used to construct fragility curves as an application. During construction of the models, 13 features of seismic waves are considered, and six wave features are selected to establish the seismic models with the correlation analysis normalizing the variables with the peak ground acceleration. Two models for six-floor and 13-floor buildings are developed, and a sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the relationship between prediction accuracy and sampling size. A 10-fold cross-validation method is used to evaluate the model performance, using the R-squared, root mean squared error, Nash criterion, and mean bias. Results of the six-parameter-based model apparently indicate a similar performance to that of the 13-parameter-based model for the two types of buildings. The model for the six-floor building affords a steadily enhanced performance by increasing the sampling size, while the model for the 13-floor building shows a significantly improved performance with a sampling size of over 200. The results indicate that the heighted structure requires a larger sampling size because it has more degrees of freedom that can influence the model performance. Finally, the proposed models are successfully constructed to estimate the maximum displacement, and applied to obtain fragility curves with various performance levels. Then, the regional seismic damage is assessed in Gyeonjgu city of South Korea as an application of the developed models. The damage assessment with the fragility curve provides the structural response from the seismic activities, which can assist in minimizing damage. regional seismic damage assessment  machine learning  Gaussian process regression  maximum displacement  fragility curve FRAGILITY ASSESSMENT  SEISMIC FRAGILITY  NETWORKS",Gaussian Process Regression-Based Structural Response Model and Its Application to Regional Damage Assessment,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07868799525816095,0.02068629970277785,0.01816953728090491,0.31631550833201805,ML
13278,"Resilience and vulnerability analysis for restoration after tsunamis and floods: The case of dwellings and industrial plants The resilience approach represents a unified and integrated framework for the restoration process following disasters. Under given resilience parameters values, a resilient system is able to recover and be strengthened within a defined recovery period; otherwise, it is a non-resilient system. This chapter considers different structures and focuses on several parameters which govern resilience together with their mechanical vulnerability under various hazards. A new method of theoretically measuring resilience, its link with mechanical vulnerability, and its sensitivity analysis are investigated for dwellings and industrial plants under the effects of flood and tsunami hazards: Non-designed (informal) masonry constructions under the effects of a flooding hazard: vulnerability is estimated after a rapid inspection by qualified engineers. Fragility curves are developed and the structural failure risk is calculated and mapped depending on the intensity of the hazard: water height and flow velocity, in a real case. Structural and non-structural waste generated by flooding: relevant models are adopted and used for predicting expected quantities of waste. The territory may take several years to recover since generated waste may represent several times annual quantities produced under normal circumstances.

19289,"On the number of required response history analyses This study investigates the number of real ground motions (GMs) required to accurately capture the structural responses when using code-, intensity-, and risk-based seismic assessment frameworks. A key consideration is the use of as-recorded hazard consistent GMs, which appropriately characterize the seismic hazard of the site, for performing response history analysis. A comparison of the structural responses of 3 steel moment resisting buildings using different sets of GMs is made with results obtained using a large set of GMs. The empirical results demonstrate that, in most cases, a risk-based assessment needs a larger number of response history analyses than an intensity-based assessment method to accurately capture the seismic demand on the structural systems. Also, given the same number of GMs, the structural responses from a risk-based assessment are more reliable and stable than those for an intensity-based method. Moreover, the results help to quantify the uncertainty in the structural responses due to using different sample sets of GMs given the applied number of GMs. In addition, the results indicate that a significant bias in structural responses is likely when following the recommendations from several seismic design codes, which suggest utilizing the maximum structural responses if 3 GM pairs are used for response history analysis. A detailed statistical analyses show that the application of 7 GM pairs are sufficient to accurately and reliably estimate structural responses. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

21975,"Traditional Structures in Turkey and Greece in 30 October 2020 Aegean Sea Earthquake: Field Observations and Empirical Fragility Assessment On 30th October 2020, an earthquake of magnitude 6.9 hit the Aegean coasts of Turkey and Greece. The epicentre was some 14 km northeast of Avlakia settlement on Samos Island, and 25 km southwest of Turkish town Seferihisar, Izmir. The destruction the earthquake caused concentrated mainly on the mid-rise RC buildings in certain districts of Izmir city. Among the diverse building typologies affected by the event are the traditional/vernacular hybrid timber-masonry and masonry buildings that are common to Turkey and Greece. This paper summarises and discusses the damage levels and mechanisms observed in these types of buildings, based on an extensive field and remote reconnaissance survey in the affected areas in both countries conducted by the Earthquake Engineering Field Investigation Team (EEFIT) of the United Kingdom Institute of Structural Engineers (IStructE). The observed damage is then discussed in light of the level of maintenance and occupancy status. The collected data are also used to empirically construct fragility curves, to assess whether a small sample can be used to describe the overall performance of the buildings in the area and how these compare to the outcomes of previous studies on comparable building stocks.

17480,"Evaluating tsunami damage of wood residential buildings in a coastal community considering waterborne debris from buildings Tsunamis are one of the most severe natural hazards that could result in human life loss and extreme damage to structures. During tsunami events, many buildings could experience significant structural damage, and some of them could be washed away. Even with many studies working on data-driven approaches using various statistical methods, the tsunami-induced physical damage to the coastal communities could not be carefully captured, especially with coastal communities with various residential building types and geographic terrains. Numerical analyses that treat buildings as single nodes ignore the effects of neighboring buildings. Nevertheless, the integrity of buildings in communities could be affected by other failed buildings since failed buildings could generate debris and impose additional loadings on neighboring buildings due to waterborne debris. In the present study, a coastal community, including multiple types of wood residential buildings, is selected to evaluate the performance of coastal communities subjected to tsunami-induced damage. Finite element models of typical buildings are established, and the inundation depth map for the community is used to consider tsunami loads. A physics-based approach considering building-generated debris is proposed for damage assessments of the coastal community. Parametric analyses are conducted to investigate the behaviors of buildings under different tsunami loads considering inundation depths, flow velocities, and debris mass. The effects of the waterborne debris generated from the upstream collapsed buildings are considered to update the damage maps of the community to show failed buildings at different flow directions. The failure rate map of the entire community with the consideration of building-generated debris impacts is further obtained. Fragility curves of single buildings are also obtained with the inundation depth treated as a random variable. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd Coastal community safety  Debris impacts  Failure analysis  Fragility analysis  Progressive damage Damage detection  Debris  Floods  Housing  Tsunamis  Coastal communities  Coastal community safety  Debris impacts  Fragility analysis  Natural hazard  Neighboring building  Progressive damage  Residential building  Tsunami damages  Tsunami loads  Failure analysis  building  coastal zone  damage  failure analysis  finite element method  safety  tsunami event  wood",Evaluating tsunami damage of wood residential buildings in a coastal community considering waterborne debris from buildings,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3430114609817155,0.00564956854556729,0.11772069814047736,0.006911506814447763,Analytical

However, there have been few seismic vulnerability studies on high-rise buildings, and few fragility curves have been developed for the buildings. Based on the published data of more than 50 high rises and super high rises, the structural information such as building heights, mode periods, locations and sites, the maximum design story drift ratios, are collected and analyzed. The vulnerability analysis for high rises uses response spectrum displacement as seismic ground motion input, since the structures have comparatively long natural period. Using statistics and regression analysis, the relationship between the maximum story drift ratio and response spectrum displacement is established.

20911,"Seismic probabilistic risk analysis based on stochastic simulation of accelerograms for nuclear power plants in the UK This article presents an approach to probabilistically assess the seismic risk of nuclear power plants (NPPs) in the UK. The approach proposed is based on direct stochastic simulation of the seismic input to conduct nonlinear dynamic analysis of a structural model of the NPP analysed. Therefore, it does not require the use of ground motion prediction equations and scaling/matching procedures to define suitable accelerograms as is done in conventional approaches. Additionally, as the structural response is directly calculated, it does not require the use of Monte Carlo-type algorithms to simulate the damage state of the NPP analysed. However, it demands longer use of computer resources as a relatively large number of nonlinear dynamic analyses are needed to perform. The approach is illustrated using an example of a 1000 MW Pressurised Water Reactor building located in a representative UK nuclear site. A comparison of risk assessment is made between the conventional and proposed approaches. Results obtained are reasonable and well constrained by conventional procedures; hence, it can confidently be used by the UK New Build Programme in the next two decades to generate 16 GWe of new nuclear capacity. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

21244,"Seismic Vulnerability of Old Italian Railway Stations Most of Italian railway stations date back to the second half of the 19th century, when the railway network was created. Although originally belonging to different companies and in spite of some modifications occurred over the years, most of these stations are masonry buildings conceived according to similar standards, with typical dimensions and morphology mostly depending on the expected traffic of passengers and goods. The common structural features of these buildings allow grouping them into building typologies, characterized by a similar structural response. This is relevant for the assessment of the seismic vulnerability of these structures, whose damage or collapse could lead to critical consequences, due to the potentially high number of victims and to the risk of interruption of critical lines. Nonlinear global analyses by equivalent-frame macroelement modelling and linear kinematic analyses of possible local failure modes have been used to assess the seismic response of building prototypes representative of the most common architectural typologies.

18328,"Identifying Driving Factors in Flood-Damaging Processes Using Graphical Models Flood damage estimation is a core task in flood risk assessments and requires reliable flood loss models. Identifying the driving factors of flood loss at residential buildings and gaining insight into their relations is important to improve our understanding of flood damage processes. For that purpose, we learn probabilistic graphical models, which capture and illustrate (in-)dependencies between the considered variables. The models are learned based on postevent surveys with flood-affected residents after six flood events, which occurred in Germany between 2002 and 2013. Besides the sustained building damage, the survey data contain information about flooding parameters, early warning and emergency measures, property-level mitigation measures and preparedness, socioeconomic characteristics of the household, and building characteristics. The analysis considers the entire data set with a total of 4,468 cases as well as subsets of the data set partitioned into single flood events and flood types: river floods, levee breaches, surface water flooding, and groundwater floods, to reveal differences in the damaging processes. The learned networks suggest that the flood loss ratio of residential buildings is directly influenced by hydrological and hydraulic aspects as well as by building characteristics and property-level mitigation measures. The study demonstrates also that for different flood events and process types the building damage is influenced by varying factors. This suggests that flood damage models need to be capable of reproducing these differences for spatial and temporal model transfers. ©2018. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.

20583,"Seismic fragility analysis of reinforced concrete structures considering reinforcement corrosion [锈蚀钢筋混凝土结构地震易损性分析] Reinforcement corrosion is an important factor that affects the durability of reinforced concrete (RC) structures. It can lead to elongation of structural natural period, change of structural demand, and deterioration of seismic capacity. This makes the seismic fragility analysis results for the corroded RC structures different from those for the uncorroded RC structures. An RC frame structure designed according to the existing code was taken as a study case. Nonlinear finite element models of uncorroded and corroded RC frame structures were developed and validated. Seismic fragility curves and the corresponding parameters of the case study building under the uncorroded and corroded conditions were obtained by both the cloud method and the stripe method. The special characteristics of the seismic fragility analysis method for the corroded RC structures were analyzed and their effects on the corresponding seismic fragility results were examined. The results show that the seismic fragility of the corroded RC structure cannot be estimated correctly without considering the elongation of structural period due to reinforcement corrosion. The seismic fragility analysis using the cloud method probably results in a lower failure probability exceeding a specific limit state for the corroded structure than that for the uncorroded counterpart. Therefore, the stripe method can better reflect the effect of reinforcement corrosion on the seismic fragility of RC structures than the cloud method. Ignoring the deterioration of structural seismic capacity will underestimate the results of seismic fragility of corroded RC structures. The Pushover-based limit state definition method is recommended to be used in the seismic fragility analysis of corroded RC structures. © 2022, Editorial Office of Journal of Building Structures.

13524,"Testing empirical and synthetic flood damage models: The case of Italy Flood risk management generally relies on economic assessments performed by using flood loss models of different complexity, ranging from simple univariable models to more complex multivariable models. The latter account for a large number of hazard, exposure and vulnerability factors, being potentially more robust when extensive input information is available. We collected a comprehensive data set related to three recent major flood events in northern Italy (Adda 2002, Bacchiglione 2010 and Secchia 2014), including flood hazard features (depth, velocity and duration), building characteristics (size, type, quality, economic value) and reported losses. The objective of this study is to compare the performances of expert-based and empirical (both uni- and multivariable) damage models for estimating the potential economic costs of flood events to residential buildings. The performances of four literature flood damage models of different natures and complexities are compared with those of univariable, bivariable and multivariable models trained and tested by using empirical records from Italy. The uni- and bivariable models are developed by using linear, logarithmic and square root regression, whereas multivariable models are based on two machine-learning techniques: random forest and artificial neural networks. Results provide important insights about the choice of the damage modelling approach for operational disaster risk management. Our findings suggest that multivariable models have better potential for producing reliable damage estimates when extensive ancillary data for flood event characterisation are available, while univariable models can be adequate if data are scarce. The analysis also highlights that expert-based synthetic models are likely better suited for transferability to other areas compared to empirically based flood damage models. © Author(s) 2019.

Capacity curves are obtained using a non-linear static analysis and are used to obtain the performance point and probability damage matrices corresponding to the specified seismic hazard. Four different buildings, representing most typical structure configuration used in the city, are studied based on detailed data from real structures. Despite low-to-moderate seismic hazard in the region, the results show that these buildings present a considerable seismic vulnerability and a relevant expected seismic damage due to its poor expected performance. seismic behavior  waffled slabs  vulnerability  damage assessment  capacity spectra  fragility curves  damage probability matrices (DPM)  reinforced concrete (RC) DERIVATION",SEISMIC DAMAGE ASSESSMENT FOR WAFFLED-SLABS REINFORCED CONCRETE (RC) BUILDINGS IN BARCELONA,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29336966194984965,0.03524454705214357,0.0748037952156375,0.007313233180998594,Analytical
21791,"The Ex-ante Evaluation of Flood Damages for a Sustainable Risk Management The present paper presents an integrated model for the ex-ante evaluation of flood damages based on stage damages curve as a decision support tool for public and private authorities in the sustainable management of risk areas. The proposed model aims to estimate the damage both at a micro-scale and on an extended area. In particular, the dynamics of flooding in flood areas and their effects on the degree of vulnerability of the different types of buildings are considered. The proposed model, already experimented in different territorial contexts, has been applied to the case of the Senigallia flood, which took place in 2014. The first results show that the approach based on damage curves applied to different types of exposed goods at a micro-scale can reliably estimate the damages to buildings. In contrast, the ex-ante estimation of indirect damages is still uncertain due to the difficulty of evaluating, according to reliable criteria, unique assets such as intangibles and cultural and environmental assets.

22056,"Uncertainties in the quantifi cation of flood damage potential [Unsicherheiten bei der Quantifizierung von Hochwasser-Schadenspotenzialen] Uncertainties in the quantification of flood damage potential The determination of flood damage potential in cost-benefit analyses is carried out in the individual federal states mostly with conventional use-oriented damage models. This type of damage functions provides expected values (average values) for the losses depending on the use and flood-specific impact parameters. The large scatter of reported losses is neglected. The paper considers the impact of vulnerability determining building parameter and different possible (use compliant) building stocks on these models. On the basis of Monte Carlo simulations, the scatter of the potential losses is calculated applying the vulnerability based, microscale EDAC-flood damage model for real flooding scenarios. The results illustrate that these uncertainties of the prognosis should be considered in the loss assessment and in particular for the scope of cost-benefit decisions. © 2016 Ernst & Sohn Verlag für Architektur und technische Wissenschaften GmbH & Co.

16676,"Damage Probability Matrices and Empirical Fragility Curves From Damage Data on Masonry Buildings After Sarpol-e-zahab and Bam Earthquakes of Iran The weakness of tensile strength and high weight in masonry structures under the dynamic loads of earthquakes has always led to structural damage, financial losses, injuries, and deaths. In spite of cheap and affordable masonry materials, their use has been very limited in constructions over the past three decades. However, common masonry materials are still found in monumental and historical structures, deteriorated texture, and rural buildings. Identifying the seismic behavior and the probability of the structural damage is vital for pre-earthquake seismic risk reduction of urban areas and the rapid post-earthquake assessment. The earthquake event that occurred in Ezgeleh on 2017 November 12 with Mw = 7.3 triggered the greatest damage in Sarpol-e-zahab city at a distance of about 37 km from the epicenter. Post-earthquake reconnaissance, microtremor analysis, and rapid visual inventory of structural damages in different zones were performed by research teams. In the present study, the strong ground motion and the peak ground acceleration, and its corresponding intensity distribution, which are based on the site response analysis in different parts of the city, are introduced. Afterward, damage probability matrices of different types of masonry buildings, namely unreinforced masonry and confined masonry buildings, are determined for both bins of peak ground accelerations and intensities. Finally, the fragility curves of two types of masonry structures are extracted based on the RISK-UE level 1 (LM1) method by assuming a beta distribution to estimate the probability distribution function of the damage. These curves are useful in assessing pre-earthquake possible damages in masonry structures with similar construction methods and similar materials to reduce seismic risks. © Copyright © 2020 Biglari and Formisano. confined masonry  damage analysis  damage probability matrix  empirical fragility curves  unreinforced masonry None",Damage Probability Matrices and Empirical Fragility Curves From Damage Data on Masonry Buildings After Sarpol-e-zahab and Bam Earthquakes of Iran,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08590727245028641,0.5988741281455545,0.021969442619685548,0.002692310080308188,Empirical

For this purpose, a parametric study on reinforced concrete (RC) buildings is carried out. Study buildings comprise 5-, 10-, 15- and 20-story, RC, code-complying, regular, moment-resisting frames designed for different strength reduction factors, e.g. R = 2, 4 and 6. The input ground motion dataset consists of 734 horizontal components of earthquake accelerograms. The best correlations between IMs and EDPs are computed by regression analysis. Sets of fragility curves in terms of maximum inter-story drift ratio, maximum plastic end rotation and maximum floor acceleration are derived based on log-normal distribution assumption.

20165,"Risk Assessment in Quantification of Hurricane Resilience of Residential Communities This paper proposes a framework to evaluate hurricane resilience of residential communities. Building resilience often refers to community resilience instead of individual resilience. Few efforts have been made to relate individual resilience to community resilience in a quantitative manner subjected to hurricane events. The proposed framework includes disaggregating hurricane community resilience to the individual level and quantifying the resilience for individual residential buildings. The framework not only consists of hurricane damage assessment including hurricane fragility analysis, reliability analysis, and loss analysis, but also analysis of recovery time, which makes the assessment framework more comprehensive and accurate. Sources of uncertainties in the framework include (1) structural modeling uncertainty (e.g., changes in roof panel resistance due to effects of corrosion on metal fasteners), (2) load uncertainty (e.g., hurricane wind characteristics), (3) uncertainty in direct and indirect loss estimation, and (4) recovery time modeling uncertainty. It is found that a community could meet certain community resilience goals as long as the individual buildings in the community could meet the individual building resilience goals.

17238,"Effect of the inelastic dynamic soil-structure interaction on the seismic vulnerability assessment This paper presents a study of the influence of inelastic dynamic soil-structure interaction (DSSI) on the seismic vulnerability assessment of buildings. The seismic vulnerability is evaluated in terms of analytical fragility curves constructed on the basis of non-linear dynamic finite elements (FE) analysis. An analytical sensibility strategy is introduced in order to define a suitable size of the motion database to be used for computing fragility curves. The fragility curves developed in this study are compared with reference curves. Concerning the effect of the inelastic DSSI, a general reduction of seismic demand when DSSI phenomena are included is found. Derived fragility curve reflects this seismic demand reduction. The importance of the ground motion database is highlighted in terms of the variability of parameters describing derived fragility curves. Comparison with reference curves are satisfactory.

21032,"Seismic risk assessment of residential buildings in Italy The last National Risk Assessment NRA for Italy was developed at the end of 2018 by the Department of Civil Protection (DPC) in response to the specific requirement of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 to periodically adjourn the assessment of disaster risk. The methodology adopted to perform seismic risk assessment and build national seismic risk maps was specifically developed to comply with the recent Code for Civil Protection, issuing that, in addition to a solid scientific base, risk assessment should be characterized by a wide consensus of the scientific community. As a result, six research units belonging to two Centers of Competence of the DPC, namely ReLUIS (Network of university laboratories for seismic engineering) and EUCENTRE (European Centre for Training and Research in Earthquake Engineering), collaborated under the guidance and coordination of DPC to produce the recent updating of national seismic risk maps for the residential building stock.

13383,"Seismic fragility models for typical non-engineered URM residential buildings in Malawi Malawi is an earthquake-prone country that lies within the East African Rift. A large proportion of its population lives in non-engineered single-storey constructions made of clay bricks and low-strength mortar. Walls are typically single-skin and often lack adequate wall-to-wall connections, leaving them vulnerable to seismic actions. This work reports a comprehensive study on the seismic fragility of unreinforced masonry buildings of the Malawi housing stock. The probability of exceeding different levels of in-plane/out-of-plane damage is estimated by considering the aleatory and epistemic uncertainties of the problem. Inter-building and intra-building variability are accounted for by adopting material test results and building survey data collected in Malawi. The in-plane capacity of building walls is calculated through a finite element model that considers the orthotropic properties of masonry. The out-of-plane capacity is computed using an analytical solution, developed for walls in one way bending. In addition, record-to-record variability is considered. The new country-specific fragility models result more conservative that global estimates, which reflects the high vulnerability of Malawian masonry buildings. These fragilities can be integrated into catastrophe modelling platforms for earthquake risk assessment in Malawi and in the wider East African region. © 2021 The Author(s) Earthquake vulnerability  Fragility curves  In-plane damage  Malawi  Masonry panel test data  Orthotropic model  Out-of-plane damage  Residential buildings  Unreinforced masonry None",Seismic fragility models for typical non-engineered URM residential buildings in Malawi,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,Analytical
21291,"Sensitivity of empirical fragility assessment of buildings to the misclassification error of damage Existing empirical fragility assessment methodologies are based on the assumption that damage data are highly reliable. However, these methods are incapable of constructing reliable fragility curves using databases contaminated with sizeable misclassification errors. These databases occur from rapid field surveys undertaken by often inexperienced engineers or, recently, due to the use of remote sensing techniques, either based on satellite, aerial or street view images. The aim of this study is to relax the assumption of high quality data and, thus, construct reliable fragility curves using databases contaminated with misclassification errors through a Bayesian ordinal regression analysis method. The proposed method is applied on the damage data collected from the first round of safety assessment of 30,783 masonry residential buildings affected by the 1978 Thessaloniki earthquake. The comparison of the proposed method with a simpler model which ignores the misclassification error highlighted the potentially significant contribution of the misclassification error in the mean fragility curves as well as their posterior uncertainty intervals. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

16764,"Derivation of analytical fragility curves using SDOF models of masonry structures in Erzincan (Turkey) Seismic loss estimation studies require fragility curves which are usually derived using ground motion datasets. Ground motion records can be either in the form of recorded or simulated time histories compatible with regional seismicity. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the use of alternative ground motion datasets (simulated and real) on the fragility curves. Simulated dataset is prepared considering regional seismicity parameters corresponding to Erzincan using the stochastic finite-fault technique. In addition, regionally compatible records are chosen from the NGA-West2 ground motion database to form the real dataset. The paper additionally studies the effects of hazard variability and two different fragility curve derivation approaches on the generated fragility curves. As the final step for verification purposes, damage states estimated for the fragility curves derived using alternative approaches are compared with the observed damage levels from the 1992 Erzincan (Turkey) earthquake (Mw=6.6). In order to accomplish all these steps, a set of representative masonry buildings from Erzincan region are analyzed using simplified structural models. The results reveal that regionally simulated ground motions can be used alternatively in fragility analyses and damage estimation studies. © 2020 Techno-Press, Ltd.

20525,"Seismic fragility analysis and index evaluation of concrete-filled steel tube column frame-core tube structures To understand the effect of connection type on the seismic fragility of concrete-filled steel tube (CFST) column frame-core tube structures, typical structures with different numbers of storeys (15, 30, 45, and 60) and different types of beam-end connections (rigid connections, hinged connections, and rigid connections with outriggers) are designed. The probabilistic seismic demand models (PSDMs) of the structures are obtained using cloud analysis, and seismic fragility curves based on the mean period and the number of storeys are established. The results show that the differences in the seismic fragilities among the structures with the three types of connections can be effectively determined by the critical inter-storey drift ratio (IDR) and the storey ductility and that the determination method with the critical IDR is relatively simple. The use of beam-end hinges in the 15-storey structure results in an advantageous seismic performance, with a lower probability of exceeding the limit states, and the performance of the 60-storey structure with beam-end hinges is sensitive to spectral acceleration. The spectral acceleration and peak ground acceleration (PGA) can effectively describe the fragility curves based on the number of storeys and the mean period, respectively.

12781,"Development and urban-scale application of a simplified method for seismic fragility assessment of RC buildings A simplified analytical method for the seismic fragility assessment of Reinforced Concrete buildings at large scale is presented. The proposed method is based on a simulated design procedure to define the structural model and on non-linear static analysis of a simplified structural model based on Shear-Type assumption to evaluate seismic capacity. Damage States are defined according to the observational-based Damage States provided by the European Macroseismic Scale (EMS-98). Presence of infills is considered, both taking into account their influence on the structural response and evaluating the damage to such non-structural elements. The method is applied to the Reinforced Concrete building stock data provided by the field survey carried out on a city in a high seismic area in Southern Italy, which are illustrated and compared with data from other sources. Uncertainties in seismic demand, material characteristics, and capacity models are taken into account through a Monte Carlo simulation technique. Fragility curves are obtained for each building, leading to the evaluation of annual failure probability at the assumed Damage States. The influence of key parameters in predicting seismic fragility, such as the number of storeys and the age of construction, is illustrated. The spatial distribution of annual failure probability at the different Damage States provides information on areas most prone to seismic risk within the city, depending both on building stock characteristics and on local amplification of seismic hazard due to soil conditions.

19346,"Order Matters: The Benefits of Ordinal Fragility Curves for Damage and Loss Estimation Probabilistic loss assessments from natural hazards require the quantification of structural vulnerability. Building damage data can be used to estimate fragility curves to obtain realistic descriptions of the relationship between a hazard intensity measure and the probability of exceeding certain damage grades. Fragility curves based on the lognormal cumulative distribution function are popular because of their empirical performance as well as theoretical properties. When we are interested in estimating exceedance probabilities for multiple damage grades, these are usually derived per damage grade via separate probit regressions. However, they can also be obtained simultaneously through an ordinal model which treats the damage grades as ordered and related instead of nominal and distinct. When we use nominal models, a collapse fragility curve is constructed by treating data of “near-collapse” and “no damage” the same: as data of noncollapse. This leads to a loss of information. Using synthetic data as well as real-life data from the 2015 Nepal earthquake, we provide one of the first formal demonstrations of multiple advantages of the ordinal model over the nominal approach. We show that modeling the ordering of damage grades explicitly through an ordinal model leads to higher sensitivity to the data, parsimony and a lower risk of overfitting, noncrossing fragility curves, and lower associated uncertainty. © 2021 The Authors.

18092,"Fragility-based analysis of the influence of effective stiffness of reinforced concrete members in shear wall buildings When modeling RC shear wall buildings for seismic analysis there is little consensus in the literature on the appropriate value of the wall effective shear stiffness (GAeff) and the slab effective bending stiffness (EIeff). A probabilistic analysis based on fragility curves is a robust technique to assess the influence of these parameters on the expected seismic performance, but such studies are scarce because they require computationally expensive analysis such as Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA). In this paper, fragility curves are developed following the recently introduced SPO2FRAG procedure, a simplified methodology that does not require IDA but the computationally more affordable incremental static (pushover) analysis. The fragility curves provided by SPO2FRAG are used to evaluate the influence of the values of GAeff and EIeff on the analytical seismic response of full 3D nonlinear models of two actual (and representative) residential wall buildings of 17 and 26 stories located in Santiago (Chile).

20053,"Reliability-based fragility analysis of nonlinear structures under the actions of random earthquake loads This study presents the reliability-based analysis of nonlinear structures using the analytical fragility curves excited by random earthquake loads. The stochastic method of ground motion simulation is combined with the random vibration theory to compute structural failure probability. The formulation of structural failure probability using random vibration theory, based on only the frequency information of the excitation, provides an important basis for structural analysis in places where there is a lack of sufficient recorded ground motions. The importance of frequency content of ground motions on probability of structural failure is studied for different levels of the nonlinear behavior of structures. The set of simulated ground motion for this study is based on the results of probabilistic seismic hazard analysis. It is demonstrated that the scenario events identified by the seismic risk differ from those obtained by the disaggregation of seismic hazard.

Flood water height, floor height from the ground, occurrence of landslide erosion and types of building materials could aggravate house damage, whereas in-house damage is exacerbated by flood water height above plinth level and types of house's plinth level. Income loss scales with flood duration, job category and household level. Flood water height, flood duration and the growth stage of paddies worsen agricultural damage. Knowing the relationship between flooding and its damaging factors, these models can be easily applied to a flood loss estimation model in further research.

17885,"Formulation of seismic fragilities for a wood-frame building based on visually determined damage indexes The study of earthquake engineering has made significant strides over the last one-half century with scientists developing methods to better understand the basis and mechanisms of earthquakes and engineers working to mitigate economic loss and fatalities. A paradigm known as performance-based seismic design (PBSD) not only provides life safety to building occupants, but seeks to control structural and nonstructural damage in buildings and other structures. The development of fragility curves based on the well-known Park-Ang damage index is examined herein. This type of formulation can provide the information needed to assess the seismic vulnerability of a structure. Existing shake table test data from the NEESWood Project's test of a 223 m 2 (1,800 sq ft) two-story house was combined with a participant survey to calibrate a damage model. The result was the development of damage fragilities based exclusively on nonlinear time history analysis. Then, the proposed numerical damage model was applied and fragility curves were developed for a six-story light-frame wood condominium building. The results appear logical based on observations of system-level shake table tests over the last decade, and thus the method shows promise provided significant torsion is not present in the system. © 2009 ASCE.

17545,"Evaluation of the seismic performance of special moment frames using incremental nonlinear dynamic analysis In this paper, the incremental nonlinear dynamic analysis is used to evaluate the seismic performance of steel moment frame structures. To this purpose, three special moment frame structure with 5, 10 and 15 stories are designed according to the Iran's national building code for steel structures and the provisions for design of earthquake resistant buildings (2800 code). Incremental Nonlinear Analysis (IDA) is performed for 15 different ground motions, and responses of the structures are evaluated. For the immediate occupancy and the collapse prevention performance levels, the probability that seismic demand exceeds the seismic capacity of the structures is computed based on FEMA350. Also, fragility curves are plotted for three highcode damage levels using HASUS provisions. Based on the obtained results, it is evident that increase in the height of the frame structures reduces the reliability level. In addition, it is concluded that for the design earthquake the probability of exceeding average collapse prevention level is considerably larger than high and full collapse prevention levels.

21472,"Statistical and vulnerability prediction model considering empirical seismic damage to masonry structures For a detailed analysis of the seismic vulnerability and failure features of masonry structures (MSs) under different intensity grades, the reconnaissance data of 136 typical catastrophic earthquakes that occurred in 18 territories of China from 1975 to 2013 were summarized and counted, empirical seismic damage inspection samples of 15,870.9888 × 104 m2 and 446,430 MS buildings were drawn, and the typical macro damage characteristics and mechanism of this type of structure were analysed. By employing the methods of probability and mathematical statistics, nonlinear vulnerability prediction, and numerical model analysis, multidimensional MS vulnerability probability statistical matrix considering the latest version of the China Macroseismic Intensity Scale (CSIS-20) was constructed. The Gauss prediction model and mean fragility probability prediction curve were proposed. The vulnerability nonlinear prediction model (function, curve, and point cloud) considering the failure/damage ratio and transcendental probability parameters was calculated and derived. According to the statistics and time-varying vulnerability analysis of damage observation data in four periods (before 1989, 1990–1999, 2000–2009, and after 2010), the empirical time-varying vulnerability models of each year were developed.

15586,"Analysis of damage data of low-rise buildings subjected to a shallow M(w)6.3 earthquake In May 2008 a shallow M(w)6.3 earthquake struck South Iceland with an epicentre close to two small towns. Nearly 5000 low-rise residential buildings were affected. The recorded maximum PGA was 0.88 g. A great deal of damage occurred, but there was no loss of life. In Iceland all buildings are registered in a detailed official database and insurance against natural disasters is obligatory. As the repair costs for every affected building had to be assessed for insurance purposes this provided an unusual opportunity to review structural performance across the whole population of buildings in the affected area. The estimated repair cost was classified in a number of subcategories covering structural and non-structural damage for five different residential building typologies. Study of these buildings showed that nonstructural damage dominated the overall damage. The main monetary damage was cosmetic damage of partition walls and flooring. The structural systems performed quite well and no buildings collapsed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Definition of damage states based on the descriptions as provided by HAZUS which gives the limit states and the associated inter-storey drift limits for RC buildings has been used.

17785,"Field evidence and numerical investigation of the Mw = 7.1 October 23 Van, Tabanli and the Mw &gt; 5.7 November earthquakes of 2011 On Sunday, October 23rd, 2011, the Van province, in the Eastern Turkey, was stricken by a magnitude Mw = 7.1 earthquake. The maximum horizontal peak ground acceleration, i. e. 0. 182 g, was measured from the seismic station in Muradiye, at about 40 km from the epicenter. Several Mw &gt; 5.7 strong motion aftershocks were recorded in November 2011. The exceptionally rich sequence of ground motions was due to the dense seismotectonic activity of the Eastern Turkey, where many active historical faults exist and newly generated can also be found because of the ongoing continental collision between the Arabian and the Eurasian Plates. The 2011 Van earthquake sequence caused 644 casualties, 1966 injuries with 252 rescues; the total economic losses are estimated at around 1 billion US dollars. The present paper deals with the seismological and structural damage assessment of two major seismic events and aftershock sequences in Van region; special emphasis is on the findings of the site investigations performed in the aftermath of the major seismic event. The performed investigation has shown that there is substantial field evidence demonstrating that the losses generated to the local social communities were caused by typical structural and non-structural deficiencies that have been surveyed in the past in several moderate-to-major earthquakes worldwide, especially in poor countries. Comprehensive numerical simulations were also carried out to assess the characteristics of the strong motion records and their effects on existing representative building type of structures in the earthquake-affected region. It was found that the local building stock is highly vulnerable and requires urgent major structural interventions for seismic strengthening. A cost-efficient retrofitting scheme is however not straightforward. It should be a trade-off between two competing aspects: the use of innovative materials and technologies on one hand, and the low-quality of the workmanships and lack of adequate quality control during construction phase, which are available in the Van province, on the other hand. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

16904,"Development of Fragility Curves for Confined Masonry Buildings in Lima, Peru This paper aims at investigating the seismic fragility of confined masonry (CM) structures in Lima, Peru, which can be used to perform earthquake scenarios at urban scale. A database describing the geometric properties (walls density, building area, height) of this type of structure was developed using data from field surveys. This information was complemented with results from experimental tests to compute a large set of capacity curves using a mechanical procedure. These models were tested against a set of ground motion records using the displacement-based earthquake loss assessment (DBELA) procedure, and the structural responses were used to derive fragility functions for four building classes.

18769,"Machine learning-aided PSDM for dams with stochastic ground motions Probabilistic seismic demand models are widely used for structures to establish a relation between the engineering demand parameter (EDP) and ground motion intensity measures (IM). For the complex infrastructures such as dams two challenges in implementation of probabilistic seismic demand models are scarcity of the appropriate real ground motions, and computational limitation to perform hundreds of simulations. This paper addresses both concerns by using a series of stochastic ground motion records as an alternative for real ones, and also employing machine learning algorithms to predict the IM-EDP relation. A 3D concrete arch dam with foundation and reservoir interaction is used as a case study of a demanding system (as opposed to 2D framed building). A large group of about 600 real and stochastic ground motion records are used to analyze the coupled system. In addition, five machine learning algorithms were used to develop the predictive meta-models. This paper also highlights the feasibility of using stochastic ground motions to predict the probabilistic seismic demand meta-models and fragility curves from real records, and vice versa. While the outcomes illustrate promising results, they also show that the existing stochastic ground motion simulation models do not cover all the inherent characteristics of the real records. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd Dams  Fragility estimation  Machine learning  Predictive meta-model  Stochastic ground motions Arch dams  Arches  Learning algorithms  Machine learning  Reservoirs (water)  Seismology  Stochastic models  Engineering demand parameters  Fragility estimation  Ground-motion  Machine learning algorithms  Meta model  Metamodeling  Predictive meta-model  Probabilistic seismic demand models  Stochastic ground motion  Stochastics  Stochastic systems",Machine learning-aided PSDM for dams with stochastic ground motions,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15247882182044376,0.021771085142772262,0.002244700411924242,0.9376348071349584,ML
21999,"Tsunami damage to ports: cataloguing damage to create fragility functions from the 2011 Tohoku event Modern tsunami events have highlighted the vulnerability of port structures to these high-impact but infrequent occurrences. However, port planning rarely includes adaptation measures to address tsunami hazards. The 2011 Tohoku tsunami presented us with an opportunity to characterise the vulnerability of port industries to tsunami impacts. Here, we provide a spatial assessment and photographic interpretation of freely available data sources. Approximately 5000 port structures were assessed for damage and stored in a database. Using the newly developed damage database, tsunami damage is quantified statistically for the first time, through the development of damage fragility functions for eight common port industries. In contrast to tsunami damage fragility functions produced for buildings from an existing damage database, our fragility functions showed higher prediction accuracies (up to 75 % accuracy). Pre-tsunami earthquake damage was also assessed in this study and was found to influence overall damage assessment.

21139,"Seismic vulnerability assessment of existing private RC constructions in northern Algeria The RC private constructions represent a large part of the housing stock in the north part of Algeria. For various reasons, they are mostly built without any seismic considerations and their seismic vulnerability remains unknown for different levels of seismic intensity possible in the region. To support future seismic risk mitigation efforts in northern Algeria, this document assesses the seismic vulnerability of typical private RC constructions built after the Boumerdes earthquake (May 21, 2003) without considering existing seismic regulation, through the development of analytical fragility curves. The fragility curves are developed for four representative RC frames in terms of slight, moderate, extensive, and complete damage states suggested in HAZUS-MH 2.1, using nonlinear time history analyses. The numerical simulation of the nonlinear seismic response of the structures is performed using the SeismoStruct software. An original intensity measure (IM) is proposed and used in this study. It is the zone acceleration coefficient A, through which the seismic hazard level is represented in the Algerian Seismic Regulations. The efficiency, practicality, and proficiency of the choice of IM are demonstrated. Incremental dynamic analyses are conducted under fifteen ground motion accelerograms compatible with the elastic target spectrum of the Algerian Seismic Regulations. In order to cover all the seismic zones of northern Algeria, the accelerograms are scaled from 0.1 to 2.5 in increments of 0.1. The results mainly indicate that private constructions built after the Boumerdes earthquake in the moderate and high seismic zones with four (04) or more storeys are highly vulnerable. accelerograms  damage state  fragility curves  IDA  intensity measure  seismic vulnerability OPTIMAL INTENSITY MEASURES  FRAGILITY CURVES  TYPICAL BRIDGES  HIGHWAY BRIDGES  BUILDINGS  FRAME  METHODOLOGY  ADEQUACY  MODEL",Seismic vulnerability assessment of existing private RC constructions in northern Algeria,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37217964946486404,0.02600051613456137,0.04876584611458686,0.006901235292401272,Analytical
17342,"Empirical fragility assessment using conditional GMPE-based ground shaking fields: application to damage data for 2016 Amatrice Earthquake Recent earthquakes have exposed the vulnerability of existing buildings; this is demonstrated by damage incurred after moderate-to-high magnitude earthquakes. This stresses the need to exploit available data from different sources to develop reliable seismic risk components. As far as it regards empirical fragility assessment, accurate estimation of ground-shaking at the location of buildings of interest is as crucial as the accurate evaluation of observed damage for these buildings. This implies that explicit consideration of the uncertainties in the prediction of ground shaking leads to more robust empirical fragility curves. In such context, the simulation-based methods can be employed to provide fragility estimates that integrate over the space of plausible ground-shaking fields. These ground-shaking fields are generated according to the joint probability distribution of ground-shaking at the location of the buildings of interest considering the spatial correlation structure in the ground motion prediction residuals and updated based on the registered ground shaking data and observed damage. As an alternative to the embedded coefficients in the ground motion prediction equations accounting for subsoil categories, stratigraphic coefficients can be applied directly to the ground motion fields at the engineering bedrock level. Empirical fragility curves obtained using the observed damage in the aftermath of Amatrice Earthquake for residential masonry buildings show that explicit consideration of the uncertainty in the prediction of ground-shaking significantly affects the results. © 2020, The Author(s).

17981,"Fragility based evaluation of different code based assessment approaches for the performance estimation of existing buildings Seismic performance of existing buildings constructed before modern seismic design codes is one of the important problems of earthquake prone countries. Increasing life and economic losses after strong earthquakes shows the necessity of seismic performance assessment studies and methods. Therefore, in this study assessment methods recommended by different seismic codes were investigated and probabilistically assessed by comparing the fragility curves of existing low- to mid-rise RC structures. Building performances were determined according to TEC-2007, TBEC-2018, EC8/3 and ASCE 41-17. Eight different occupied buildings, classified according to construction dates (old and new) and story numbers (3 to 6), were selected and investigated by using these codes. At first, building capacity curves and damage limits, defined by the different code methods, were determined via pushover analyses. Structures were then subjected to more than 300 real strong ground motion (GM) records employing nonlinear dynamic analysis and fragility curves were obtained. Static analysis results showed that strength, stiffness and deformation capacity of new buildings are significantly higher than old ones according to all seismic codes considered and it is observed that TBEC-2018 gives the most conservative capacity estimations with respect to others. Comparison of fragility curves indicated that damage probabilities of TBEC-2018 and EC8/3 are higher than other seismic codes and this situation is valid for all story number and building age classes. In most cases TBEC-2018 and TEC-2007 results represent the upper and lower bounds of damage probabilities. It was also found that building age is the most effective parameter that affect the fragilities of existing buildings. Distribution of fragility curves imply that different code methods can give significantly different damage estimations under identical seismic demand levels. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

16051,"Building vulnerability assessment in seismic areas using ensemble learning: A Nepal case study The vulnerability assessment is a crucial method for earthquake-prone areas to manage seismic risk. This paper develops an Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based model to assess the seismic vulnerability of buildings in Kavrepalanchok, Nepal. The vulnerability assessment model is trained based on the building survey data of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake. To rectify the impacts of class imbalance in raw data, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) technique is adopted in the data preprocessing stage. Then, XGBoost models for the 3 selected target variables are developed respectively. Finally, the performances of the developed models are evaluated, and the significant features that influence the vulnerability are investigated using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) technique. Important findings are: (1) The developed SMOTE-XGBoost model for the overall building damage achieves the highest macro f1 score of 0.729 compared with other machine learning models. (2) The SMOTE technique is favorable when the label requiring more attention is the minor group (e.g., severe damage). (3) The foundation type, the roof type, and the building age are identified as the most significant features for the overall building damage grade.

12645,"Bayesian tsunami fragility modeling considering input data uncertainty Empirical tsunami fragility curves are developed based on a Bayesian framework by accounting for uncertainty of input tsunami hazard data in a systematic and comprehensive manner. Three fragility modeling approaches, i.e. lognormal method, binomial logistic method, and multinomial logistic method, are considered, and are applied to extensive tsunami damage data for the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. A unique aspect of this study is that uncertainty of tsunami inundation data (i.e. input hazard data in fragility modeling) is quantified by comparing two tsunami inundation/run-up datasets (one by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transportation of the Japanese Government and the other by the Tohoku Tsunami Joint Survey group) and is then propagated through Bayesian statistical methods to assess the effects on the tsunami fragility models. The systematic implementation of the data and methods facilitates the quantitative comparison of tsunami fragility models under different assumptions. Such comparison shows that the binomial logistic method with un-binned data is preferred among the considered models; nevertheless, further investigations related to multinomial logistic regression with un-binned data are required. Finally, the developed tsunami fragility functions are integrated with building damage-loss models to investigate the influences of different tsunami fragility curves on tsunami loss estimation. Numerical results indicate that the uncertainty of input tsunami data is not negligible (coefficient of variation of 0.25) and that neglecting the input data uncertainty leads to overestimation of the model uncertainty. © 2016, The Author(s). 2011 Tohoku earthquake  Bayesian regression  Logistic regression  Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation  Multinomial regression  Tsunami fragility Earthquakes  Floods  Geophysics  Hazards  Input output programs  Intelligent systems  Markov processes  Monte Carlo methods  Regression analysis  Uncertainty analysis  2011 tohoku earthquakes  Bayesian regression  Logistic regressions  Markov chain monte carlo simulation  Multinomials  Tsunamis  Bayesian analysis  computer simulation  Markov chain  modeling  Monte Carlo analysis  regression analysis  Tohoku earthquake 2011  tsunami  uncertainty analysis",Bayesian tsunami fragility modeling considering input data uncertainty,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,Empirical
19270,"Observed seismic vulnerability of Italian Buildings A very large database of post-earthquake building inspections carried out after the main Italian events of the last 30 years has been processed in order to derive fragility curves for 23 building typologies, mostly referring to masonry structures. The records (more than 91000) of this very complete and homogeneous dataset have been converted into a single damage scale with five levels of damage, plus the case of no damage. For each affected municipality a value of PGA and Housner Intensity (IH) has been evaluated using attenuation laws. Damage probability matrices have been then extracted. These experimental data have been fitted through lognormal fragility curves using an advanced nonlinear regression algorithm also taking into account the relative reliability of each point by the bootstrap technique. The significant concentration of experimental data at low levels of ground motion, associated to the selected analytical expression, determine the peculiar shape of some of the curves, with a very steep initial branch followed by an almost horizontal curve for increasing values of ground motion.

In this study, analytical fragility curves are derived by considering architectural and structural details of three to eight story reinforced concrete buildings, which constitute the major part of the existing building stock in the city of Izmir and are used for residential purpose. Nonlinear static analyses are performed by generating 3D models of the buildings. Spectral displacement demand of the buildings is determined for different earthquake levels, which are defined in the Turkish Seismic Design Code2007. Four limit states are defined for each building class in terms of spectral displacement.

20634,"Seismic fragility assessment of masonry building aggregates: A case study in the old city Centre of Seixal, Portugal Aggregates made of old masonry structures represent a very common structural typology in many cities of the world. The structural units along the aggregates are characterized frequently by structural and geometrical heterogeneities. But urban growth led to the formation of many historic centres with similar structural typologies. The present study aims to assess the seismic fragility of masonry building aggregates using the old city centre of Seixal as a case study. The analysis involved the assessment of the most prevalent structural typology in the study area, considering the variability of a set of structural and geometrical parameters. The variation of such parameters has allowed the definition of 36 different structural configurations, whose seismic performance behaviours were studied employing non-linear static analyses. Based on the analyses, the peak ground accelerations (PGAC) corresponding to the attainment of the life safety limit state were obtained and the fragility curves were plotted. Furthermore, the behaviour of the structural configurations, analysed as isolated structural units, is also compared with their aggregate structural performance. Significant differences in the vulnerability of the buildings when isolated or in the aggregate are obtained, demonstrating that the seismic interactions between adjacent buildings should not be neglected. It was further possible to observe that the variation of the considered parameters significantly affects the seismic response of the building, particularly when the characteristics of the internal slabs are changed. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. fragility curves  isolated structural unit  masonry aggregate  push-over  seismic vulnerability Aggregates  Buildings  Geometry  Masonry construction  Masonry materials  Seismic response  Urban growth  Adjacent buildings  Masonry structures  Non-linear static analysis  Peak ground acceleration  Seismic Performance  Structural configurations  Structural performance  Structural typologies  Structural analysis  aggregate  historic building  masonry  peak acceleration  seismic response  Portugal","Seismic fragility assessment of masonry building aggregates: A case study in the old city Centre of Seixal, Portugal",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16143628108656286,0.05688800696179096,0.01945824470285629,0.015685522512833658,Analytical
20645,"Seismic Fragility Assessment of RC Moment-Resisting Frames Designed According to the Current Chinese Seismic Design Code Seismic fragility was assessed for 72 RC moment-resisting frame building structures designed according to the current Chinese seismic design code for buildings, taking into account the uncertainty of the structural material strength and earthquake ground motions. The site soil type, the number of stories, and the seismic protection intensity were considered to be the main design variables of the reference structures. Fragilities for four damage levels, i.e., fully operational, operational, repairable, and collapse prevention, are developed in this study. The global seismic damage index, which reflects the effects of individual structural components, and the maximum inter-story drift ratio, which is closely related to the seismic damage of structural and nonstructural components, was employed as the damage identifiers. For each frame structure, the probability of exceeding each damage level in an earthquake with a specified PGA was determined by conducting nonlinear time history analysis. Fragility curves for the four damage levels were derived by regression analysis using the nonlinear least-squares method. The structural reliability of RC frames against earthquakes was examined using the developed fragility curves. The results indicate that seismic performance objectives for RC frame structures designed in accordance with the current Chinese code can be achieved with good reliability.

17415,"Estimating flood damage to railway infrastructure - the case study of the March River flood in 2006 at the Austrian Northern Railway Models for estimating flood losses to infrastructure are rare and their reliability is seldom investigated although infrastructure losses might contribute considerably to the overall flood losses. In this paper, an empirical modelling approach for estimating direct structural flood damage to railway infrastructure and associated financial losses is presented. Via a combination of event data, i.e. photo-documented damage on the Northern Railway in Lower Austria caused by the March River flood in 2006, and simulated flood characteristics, i.e. water levels, flow velocities and combinations thereof, the correlations between physical flood impact parameters and damage occurred to the railway track were investigated and subsequently rendered into a damage model. After calibrating the loss estimation using recorded repair costs of the Austrian Federal Railways, the model was applied to three synthetic scenarios with return periods of 30, 100 and 300 years of March River flooding. Finally, the model results are compared to depth-damage-curve-based approaches for the infrastructure sector obtained from the Rhine Atlas damage model and the Damage Scanner model. The results of this case study indicate a good performance of our two-stage model approach. However, due to a lack of independent event and damage data, the model could not yet be validated. Future research in natural risk should focus on the development of event and damage documentation procedures to overcome this significant hurdle in flood damage modelling.

21399,"Simulation-based fragility relationships for unreinforced masonry buildings Unreinforced masonry (URM) structures represent a significant portion of the residential building stock of the central and eastern United States. Fifteen percent of homes in the eight-state region impacted by the New Madrid Seismic Zone are URM buildings. The brittle nature of URM buildings further supports a thorough consideration of seismic response given the susceptibility to severe failure modes. Currently, there is a pressing need for analytically based fragility curves for URM buildings. To improve the estimation of damage-state probabilities through the development of simulation-based URM fragilities, an extensive literature survey is conducted on pushover analysis. Using these data, capacity curves are generated, from which damage performance limit states are defined. Demand is simulated using synthetically derived accelerograms representative of the central and eastern United States. Structural response is evaluated using an advanced capacity spectrum method. Capacity, demand, and response are thus derived analytically and utilized to generate a more reliable and uniform set of fragility curves for use in loss-assessment software. This paper presents a framework amenable to rapid, flexible updating that, with the appropriate database of studies, is capable of producing curves representative of any URM building typology subjected to a specified hazard. The curves are expressed in multiple forms to demonstrate capability of use in various loss-assessment applications. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

15163,"A hybrid method for the vulnerability assessment of R/C and URM buildings The methodology followed by the Aristotle University (AUTh) team for the vulnerability assessment of reinforced concrete (R/C) and unreinforced masonry (URM) structures is presented. The paper focuses on the derivation of vulnerability (fragility) curves in terms of peak ground acceleration (PGA), as well as spectral displacement (s d), and also includes the estimation of capacity curves, for several R/C and URM building types. The vulnerability assessment methodology is based on the hybrid approach developed at AUTh, which combines statistical data with appropriately processed (utilising repair cost models) results from nonlinear dynamic or static analyses, that permit extrapolation of statistical data to PGA's and/or spectral displacements for which no data are available. The statistical data used herein are from earthquake-damaged greek buildings. An extensive numerical study is carried out, wherein a large number of building types (representing most of the common typologies in S. Europe) are modelled and analysed. Vulnerability curves for several damage states are then derived using the aforementioned hybrid approach. These curves are subsequently used in combination with the mean spectrum of the Microzonation study of Thessaloniki as the basis for the derivation of new vulnerability curves involving spectral quantities. Pushover curves are derived for all building types, then reduced to standard capacity curves, and can easily be used together with the S d fragility curves as an alternative for developing seismic risk scenarios.

12967,"Fragility Curves for Buildings Based on Damage Data in Uki City due the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake A series of earthquakes hit Kumamoto Prefecture in Kyushu Island, Japan, on April 14 and 16, 2016. A large number of buildings, mostly wooden houses, were damaged. This study developed fragility curves of buildings using the damage survey data provided by the Uki City government. The damage ratios of buildings were investigated from the viewpoints of the structural material and the construction period. As the result, the damage ratio of wooden buildings was found to be larger than those of other structural materials, and the damage ratios of major, moderate+, and moderate- got smaller as the construction period became newer. Empirical fragility curves of buildings for Uki City were constructed based on the damage survey data and the estimated peak ground velocity (PGV). Compared with the result of the previous study for Mashiki Town due the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, the major damage ratios of wooden buildings for Uki City was shown in a lower level than those for Mashiki Town in the same PGV. The fragility curves for Uki City were obtained using the damage survey data in the smaller PGV range than that for Mashiki Town, thus the regression results reflected the damage trend in the small PGVs. The fragility curves for Uki City and Mashiki Town due the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake were compared with those for Nishinomiya City and Nada Ward due the 1995 Kobe earthquake.

15628,"Analytical fragility curves for masonry school building portfolios in Nepal Schools represent a reference point for communities in any part of the world. Therefore, their safety and resilience against natural catastrophes is of paramount importance. The recent 2015 Gorkha earthquake has unfortunately shown that Nepalese school buildings are highly vulnerable to seismic actions. Most of them are indeed constituted by low-quality unreinforced masonry (URM). The quantification of URM vulnerability is fundamental to estimate the risk associated to school building portfolios at territorial scale. This work discusses statistics available for Nepalese schools and then presents analytical fragility curves for three recurrent URM typologies covering more than 50% of the school building stock. The methodology adopted to derive fragilities is spectral-based and accounts for out-of-plane and in-plane damage potential in a single easy-to-use analytical framework. Inter-building, intra-building and record-to-record variabilities are directly considered in the analysis. The obtained fragilities integrate the studies available for the region and can be used for pre-/post-earthquake risk assessment and prioritization of interventions at country level. © 2020, The Author(s).

When a structure is subjected to earthquake, foundation undergoes three modes of deformation, namely vertical, sliding and rocking.

In the present study, a numerical modelling is carried out using the finite element software OpenSees to evaluate the seismic response of a typical eight-storey four-bay vertical geometric irregular building considering soil–structure interaction and the results are compared with a reference regular building. The numerical modelling is carried out considering the footings as beams on nonlinear Winkler foundation in which footing is modelled as elastic elements and the soil is modelled as discrete nonlinear springs in both vertical and horizontal directions. Fibre-based nonlinear element is used for modelling the reinforced concrete beams and columns. A suite of five earthquake ground motion records of different magnitudes is considered for the dynamic analyses. Four types of soil–structure interactions are considered: fixed regular, fixed VGI, flexible regular and flexible VGI.

Five categories of performance levels (PL), four limit states (LS) and the relative intensity measure (IM) having a high relation with the ground motion are defined to calculate the fragility of the AP1000 NIB under 15 earthquake sequences. A comparison of the results shows that the probabilities of minor damage, severe damage, and collapse damage for concrete are much higher than the reinforcement bar, which indicates that the fragility of concrete dominates the damage probability of the NIB. The fragility curves of the auxiliary building (AB) and shield building (SB) obtained by IDA and MSA are consistent with each other, but the distinction is mainly on the peak values or increasing ratio. Additionally, the probabilities of minor damage, moderate damage, severe damage and collapse damage of AB are less than the cases of SB. Lastly, the results also indicate that fragility curves are efficiently assessed and essential for risk assessments of the NIB. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd AP1000 NIB  Damage index  Far-field earthquake  Fragility analysis  Intensity measure Concretes  Earthquakes  Nuclear fuels  Nuclear power plants  Pressurized water reactors  Risk assessment  Damage probability  Earthquake sequences  Far-field ground motion  Fragility assessment  Incremental dynamic analysis  Performance level  Relative intensity  Seismic fragility analysis  Damage detection  building  collapse  ground motion  nuclear power plant  risk assessment  seismic response",Seismic fragility analysis of nuclear power plant structure under far-field ground motions,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20048039958113162,0.09862934326876725,0.020029187936166624,0.0231479002983824,Analytical

17992,"Fragility curves at regional basis for unreinforced masonry buildings prone to out-of-plane mechanisms: the case of Central Italy The seismic protection of small and medium historical towns is an important and current issue in Italy and in many other earthquake prone regions of Europe, where seismic actions are generally responsible for severe damages and collapses of buildings. In this context, the seismic vulnerability assessment of unreinforced masonry buildings assumes a crucial role considering the fact that they represent a widespread construction typology in Italian and European towns. Among the various approaches to evaluate the seismic vulnerability of existing buildings, fragility curves represent a very effective one in predicting potential damages of geographical areas characterized by similar building typologies. This paper presents the evaluation of fragility curves for macro-typologies of masonry buildings representative of a specific regional area in Italy and prone to the occurrence of out-of-plane collapse mechanisms in case of seismic events.

17394,"Enhancement of large-scale flood risk assessments using building-material-based vulnerability curves for an object-based approach in urban and rural areas In this study, we developed an enhanced approach for large-scale flood damage and risk assessments that uses characteristics of buildings and the built environment as object-based information to represent exposure and vulnerability to flooding. Most current large-scale assessments use an aggregated land-use category to represent the exposure, treating all exposed elements the same. For large areas where previously only coarse information existed such as in Africa, more detailed exposure data are becoming available. For our approach, a direct relation between the construction type and building material of the exposed elements is used to develop vulnerability curves. We further present a method to differentiate flood risk in urban and rural areas based on characteristics of the built environment. We applied the model to Ethiopia and found that rural flood risk accounts for about 22% of simulated damage; rural damage is generally neglected in the typical land-use-based damage models, particularly at this scale. Our approach is particularly interesting for studies in areas where there is a large variation in construction types in the building stock, such as developing countries. © 2019 Author(s).

18096,"Fragility-based assessment of typical mid-rise and low-rise RC buildings in Turkey This paper focuses on the seismic fragility assessment of typical low-rise and mid-rise reinforced concrete (RC) buildings in Turkey by considering Düzce Damage database, which was compiled after the two devastating earthquakes in 1999 that affected the Marmara region. A set of fragility curves is developed by making use of the building characteristics in the database. The generated fragility curve set is referred as ""reference"" since it forms the basis of a parametric study. Then the influence of sampling techniques, sample size, type of hysteresis model and limit state definitions on the fragility curves is investigated. The results revealed that the uncertainty in capacity and degradation characteristics have a significant influence whereas the other investigated parameters do not seem to have an important role on the final fragility functions. In the last part of the study, the damage observed in Düzce buildings after 1999 earthquakes is estimated by using the generated fragility curves for low-rise and mid-rise RC frame buildings. Estimated damage distributions seem to be comparable with the actual damage data. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An essential aspect of this methodology relies on the definition of the relationship between the collapse probability of buildings designed according to modern seismic regulations and the considered design ground motion. This study adds to previous research on the topic of seismic risk-targeted hazard assessment by investigating how the collapse probability varies with the design level of ground motion, and how this variability influences the resulting seismic risk across Europe. A large number of structures designed according to the most recent seismic regulation in Europe have been analysed. These structures were designed for increasing levels of peak ground acceleration ranging from values close to zero (i.e. buildings located in regions with very low seismic hazard) up to 0.40 g (i.e. moderate to high seismic hazard). Each structure was modelled as a tri-dimensional finite element model, and tested against a set of ground motion records using nonlinear dynamic analyses. Several fragility functions were derived for yielding and collapse damage states, and combined with the seismic hazard curves from the European project SHARE to calculate the spatial distribution of earthquake risk across Europe.

15200,"A modified sub-assembly approach for hurricane induced wind-surge-wave vulnerability assessment of low-rise wood buildings in coastal communities The coastal low-rise buildings account for large amounts of property loss during hurricanes, which makes it essential to perform vulnerability assessments of buildings and communities to estimate the possible structural damage and economical loss. Fragility assessment and loss prediction are usually performed with the sub-assembly (SA) approach in the HAZUS-MH model. However, hydrodynamic forces caused by surge and waves are excluded, and damages from wind and flood are assumed independent of each other. In the present study, a modified sub-assembly (MSA) approach is proposed based on the SA approach for the hurricane-induced wind-surge-wave vulnerability assessments for buildings and communities considering the hurricane-induced wind-surge-wave loadings without the predefined assumption. The physics-based high-fidelity finite element models are established, and the structural performances are analyzed for three typical coastal residential wood buildings under individual wind or surge-wave loadings and combined wind-surge-wave loadings. Building type is found to be a key factor influencing the vulnerabilities of the buildings, and building elevation is an effective method to mitigate building damages from surge-wave loadings as well as hurricane-induced wind-surge-wave loadings. Profound influences of wind profile shifting under combined wind-surge-wave loading are observed on elevated buildings' vulnerabilities at some stillwater levels for different building types. The MSA approach outperforms the SA approach in the building vulnerability prediction at the hurricane-induced wind-surge-wave scenarios, especially for the elevated buildings. A smaller wind speed interval is recommended to help with the building vulnerability prediction accuracy of the MSA approach. The vulnerability assessment of a coastal community further validates the accuracy of the proposed MSA approach.

19135,"Nonlinear response of RC structures: Statistical effects of artificial ground motions The selection of seismic inputs for nonlinear dynamic analysis is widely debated, mainly focusing on the advantages and disadvantages provided by the choice of natural, simulated or artificial records. However, most of the available technical codes do not provide always the same suggestions and well-defined procedures for the generation of artificial ground motions.Considering that the strategy of the generation of accelerogramsmakes some doubts raises about the possible effect on the structural response, the work aims to investigate the differences of the structural behavior by using accelerograms nominally equivalent but different in terms of stationarity. This paper presents a comparative study of the structural responses of some reinforced concrete buildings under artificial accelerograms, characterized by a different shape depending on the strategy of generation. Initially, nonlinear response under three sets of accelerograms (50 stationary, 50 non-stationary evenly modulated and 50 fully non-stationary) equivalent in terms of pseudo acceleration spectrum is evaluated and compared. Then, the responses derived by the Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA) are compared and discussed by the statistical point of view.

16898,"Development of flood damage assessment method for residential areas considering various house types for Bago Region of Myanmar Development of a flood damage estimation method that considers house type is important to evaluate the effectiveness of different adaptation options. This study aimed to analyze flood impact on residential areas and household damage, to develop a new, more accurate, method for flood damage assessment, considering different house types. To do this it was necessary to understand the vulnerability of different house types and household assets, and to develop flood damage functions which accounted for these variations. We considered the Bago River basin of Myanmar as a study area. A detailed household questionnaire survey was conducted to collect data. Using this data, new flood damage functions for residential buildings and assets for different types of house were developed by considering building characteristics such as construction materials, number of stories, and height of plinth level from the ground. The actual and potential flood damage data were combined to develop flood damage functions with improved accuracy for extreme floods. Then, flood damage to residential buildings and assets for recent floods were assessed by developing a grid-based approach, integrating hydrologic-hydraulic and flood loss estimation models. The reduction in expected annual damage by use of different flood adaptation options for residential buildings was also evaluated quantitatively. The results of this study show that elevating the plinth level of the building and adding an additional story to the house can significantly reduce the flood damage to residential buildings and assets, and these results provide useful information for establishing flood protection adaptation measures. © 2021 The Authors Adaptation measures  Damage functions  Flood impact  Residential areas  Risk reduction None",Development of flood damage assessment method for residential areas considering various house types for Bago Region of Myanmar,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1519607103697276,0.2146765710306953,0.20974112367885012,0.013291623497409918,Empirical
17092,"Earthquake damage estimation in Metro Manila, Philippines based on seismic performance of buildings evaluated by local experts’ judgments Building damage due to a scenario earthquake in Metro Manila, Philippines is estimated based on seismic performance of the buildings evaluated by local experts’ judgments. For the damage estimation, building capacity curves and fragility curve are developed from questionnaire to the local experts of structural engineering. The Delphi method is used to integrate the experts’ opinions. The derived capacity curves are validated by comparing with the result of pushover analysis for typical buildings. Building responses due to simulated ground motions are estimated by the capacity spectrum method. Damage ratios are calculated from the fragility curves and the building responses. Distributions of the damaged buildings are computed by multiplying the damage ratios and the building inventory. The distribution and the amount of the damaged buildings in this study show significant difference from the estimation with the capacity curves of HAZUS, suggesting the importance of evaluation of the region-specific building performance.

19577,"Post-earthquake Damage Simulation of Two Colonial Unreinforced Clay Brick Masonry Buildings Using the Equivalent Frame Approach In New World colonial countries and territories such as Australia, New Zealand, and the West Coast of North America, the predominant form of unreinforced masonry (URM) construction is relatively modest one or two storey buildings composed of clay brick masonry. While the equivalent frame (EF) approach for modelling the in-plane seismic response of URM buildings is gaining popularity, particularly in Mediterranean countries, the procedure is currently relatively unknown elsewhere and the validity of the procedure when applied to simple and prevalent New World clay brick URM construction has not yet been demonstrated in a meaningful way. To address this deficiency and provide a novel evidence base for use of the procedure by the professional structural engineering community, modelling of the seismic response of two unreinforced clay brick masonry buildings that were damaged during the 2010/2011 Canterbury earthquake sequence is reported. Static and dynamic nonlinear analyses were undertaken by applying the equivalent frame (EF) approach, and time-history records attained during the Canterbury earthquake sequence were used to conduct dynamic analyses and facilitate direct comparison to observed building damage. The effect of diaphragm stiffness on the global response of the two case-study buildings was also studied. It is shown that use of the EF method enabled prediction of the seismic response of the two case-study clay brick URM buildings with a high level of accuracy.

17331,"Empirical damage and liquefaction fragility curves from 2012 Emilia earthquake data The study focuses on the effects of liquefaction on structures taken from data on about 1000 private residential masonry buildings located in several municipalities struck by the 2012 Emilia earthquake. Survey data were collected by teams of experts coordinated by the Italian Department of Civil Protection in the immediate post-earthquake emergency phase. They included information on building characteristics and the level and extent of the damage to structural and non-structural components. Furthermore, according to data related to the reconstruction process, information on the liquefaction-induced type and extent of the damage was also collected. Through a comparative analysis of the empirical damage, it was found that liquefaction strongly affected the buildings, confirming its relevance in the damage scenario under specific subsoil conditions. Based on this evidence, the article proposes a correlation between structural damage and liquefaction when it comes to deriving proper preliminary empirical fragility curves.

20076,"Reparability-based fragility analysis of masonry infills in buildings [基于修复性的砌体填充墙易损性研究] The failure of infill walls occuring in previous earthquakes may suspend the occupancy of the building and lead to considerable economic loss. To provide basis for quantitative evaluation of building losses in earthquakes, two damage states, namely the 'simple repair' and 'substantial repair' states, are defined for masonry infills based on their reparability. From the existing experimental data of masonry infills of hollow blocks, solid concrete blocks and clay bricks in the literature, 16 specimens of typical materials and high-quality data were selected as samples to analyze the seismic fragility for different types of masonry infills at the aforementioned damage states by taking the form of lognormal cumulative distribution functions. The results show that the masonry infills of either hollow or solid concrete blocks are likely to sustain significant damage and reach the 'substantial repair' limit state even if the hosting moment frame just reaches the elastic inter-story drift limit as per the Chinese seismic design code. The deformability of unreinforced clay brick infills is much larger than that of hollow or solid concrete block infills, but is inferior to reinforced ones. © 2018, Editorial Office of Journal of Building Structures.

15333,"A review of tsunami damage assessment methods and building performance in Thailand Although the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami occurred several years ago and all the building repair and infrastructure reconstruction needed in Thailand to repair the damage caused by the tsunami are complete, there is still a need for damage assessment methods that can be used in future tsunami damage assessments in Thailand and that can possibly be applied to other countries. This study summarizes three methods for assessing tsunami damage, ""tsunami damage criteria,"" ""tsunami damage ratios"" and ""tsunami fragility curves,"" based on damage data from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami in Thailand, and these methods are compared using other tsunami events. Using the data from a field survey of damaged buildings, tsunami damage criteria were summarized for each degree of damage as a function of inundation depth for different building types. Tsunami damage ratios were summarized using building damage data obtained from surveys in the field and reconstruction cost estimates provided by the Thai government. The fragility curves developed were validated based on building performance data obtained from full-scale experiments on buildings and columns. Despite differences in the tsunami characteristics (inundation depth, current velocity and hydrodynamic force), the damage probabilities were nearly the same. The summarized methods might be useful for future tsunami damage assessments and loss estimation in Thailand and serve as guidelines for tsunami damage assessment in other countries. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company. 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami  building damage  damage assessment  damage ratio  tsunami fragility None",A review of tsunami damage assessment methods and building performance in Thailand,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2988213825662119,0.2490811940933097,0.06902005912021973,0.005334621551994973,Analytical

21174,"Seismic vulnerability assessment of RC buildings according to the 2007 and 2018 Turkish seismic codes Fragility curves are useful tools to estimate the damage probability of buildings owing to seismic actions. The purpose of this study is to investigate seismic vulnerability of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings, according to the 2007 and 2018 Turkish Seismic Codes, using fragility curves. For the numerical analyses, typical five-and seven-storey RC buildings were selected and incremental dynamic analyses (IDA) were performed. To complete the IDAs, eleven earthquake acceleration records multiplied by various scaling factors from 0.2g to 0.8g were used. To predict nonlinearity, a distributed hinge model that involves material and geometric nonlinearity of the structural members was used. Damages to confined concrete and reinforcement bar of structural members were obtained by considering the unit deformation demands of the 2007 Turkish Seismic Code (TSC-2007) and the 2018 Turkey Building Earthquake Code (TBEC-2018). Vulnerability evaluation of these buildings was performed using fragility curves based on the results of incremental dynamic analyses. Fragility curves were generated in terms of damage levels occurring in confined concrete and reinforcement bar of structural members with a lognormal distribution assumption.

18022,"Fragility curves for RC buildings using High Dimensional Model Representation Fragility curves represent the conditional probability that a structure's response may exceed the performance limit for a given ground motion intensity. Conventional methods for computing building fragilities are either based on statistical extrapolation of detailed analyses on one or two specific buildings or make use of Monte Carlo simulation with these models. However, the Monte Carlo technique usually requires a relatively large number of simulations in order to obtain a sufficiently reliable estimate of the fragilities, and it is computationally expensive and time consuming to simulate the required thousand of nonlinear seismic analyses. In this paper, High Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR) based response surface method together with the Monte Carlo Simulation is used to develop the fragility curve, which is then compared with that obtained by using Latin Hypercube sampling. It is used to replace the algorithmic performancefunction with an explicit functional relationship, fitting a functional approximation, thereby reducing the number of expensive numerical analyses.

20450,"Seismic damage evaluation in urban areas using the capacity spectrum method: Application to Barcelona Conceptual aspects related to seismic vulnerability, damage and risk evaluation are discussed first, together with a short review of the most widely used possibilities for seismic evaluation of structures. The capacity spectrum method and the way of obtaining seismic damage scenarios for urban areas starting from capacity and fragility curves are then discussed. The determination of capacity curves for buildings using non-linear structural analysis tools is then explained, together with a simplified expeditious procedure allowing the development of fragility curves. The seismic risk of the buildings of Barcelona, Spain, is analyzed in the paper, based on the application of the capacity spectrum method. The seismic hazard in the area of the city is described by means of the reduced 5% damped elastic response spectrum. The information on the buildings was obtained by collecting, arranging, improving and completing a broad database of the dwellings and current buildings. The buildings existing in Barcelona are mainly of two types: unreinforced masonry structures and reinforced concrete buildings with waffled-slab floors. The ArcView software was used to create a GIS tool for managing the collected information in order to develop seismic risk scenarios. This study shows that the vulnerability of the buildings is significant in Barcelona and, therefore, in spite of the low-to-moderate seismic hazard in the region, the expected seismic risk is considerable. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

These damage functions are shown to be sensitive to the topography data used in the simulation, as well as the hydrodynamic or wave forcing parameter chosen for the correlation. The most robust damage functions result from highly accurate topographic data and are correlated with water depth or total (flow plus wave) force.

21972,"Tracing the value of data for flood loss modelling Flood loss modelling is associated with considerable uncertainty. If prediction uncertainty of flood loss models is large, the reliability of model outcomes is questionable, and thus challenges the practical usefulness. A key problem in flood loss estimation is the transfer of models to geographical regions and to flood events that may differ from the ones used for model development. Variations in local characteristics and continuous system changes require regional adjustments and continuous updating with current evidence. However, acquiring data on damage influencing factors is usually very costly. Therefore, it is of relevance to assess the value of additional data in terms of model performance improvement. We use empirical flood loss data on direct damage to residential buildings available from computer aided telephone interviews that were compiled after major floods in Germany. This unique data base allows us to trace the changes in predictive model performance by incrementally extending the data base used to derive flood loss models. Two models are considered: a uni-variable stage damage function and RF-FLEMO, a multi-variable probabilistic model approach using Random Forests. Additional data are useful to improve model predictive performance and increase model reliability, however the gains also seem to depend on the model approach. © 2016 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

16081,"Capacity, fragility and damage in reinforced concrete buildings: a probabilistic approach The main goals of this article are to analyze the use of simplified deterministic nonlinear static procedures for assessing the seismic response of buildings and to evaluate the influence that the uncertainties in the mechanical properties of the materials and in the features of the seismic actions have in the uncertainties of the structural response. A reinforced concrete building is used as a guiding case study. In the calculation of the expected spectral displacement, deterministic nonlinear static methods are simple and straightforward. For not severe earthquakes these approaches lead to somewhat conservative but adequate results when compared to more sophisticated procedures involving nonlinear dynamic analyses. Concerning the probabilistic assessment, the strength properties of the materials, concrete and steel, and the seismic action are considered as random variables. The Monte Carlo method is then used to analyze the structural response of the building. The obtained results show that significant uncertainties are expected; uncertainties in the structural response increase with the severity of the seismic actions. The major influence in the randomness of the structural response comes from the randomness of the seismic action. A useful example for selected earthquake scenarios is used to illustrate the applicability of the probabilistic approach for assessing expected damage and risk. An important conclusion of this work is the need of broaching the fragility of the buildings and expected damage assessment issues from a probabilistic perspective.

12905,"Evaluation of seismic vulnerability of hospitals in the tehran metropolitan area The Tehran metropolitan area is extremely vulnerable to earthquakes due to the location of its active faults and its dense population. Assessing the probable damage of a high magnitude earthquake on buildings and facilities relies on a precise structural survey, which has an empirical basis depending on historic ground motions. The probability of damage and failure in discrete limits based on different ground motions is estimated by fragility curves. Using the most matching fragility curves for buildings in Tehran, the vulnerability of the hospitals in the capital, as one of the most critical structures in crisis management of disasters, was investigated in this study. Subsequently, the existing fragility curves, developed for Tehran and the other seismic prone countries such as Japan and the United States, were compared considering the typology of Tehran’s hospitals. Finally, the possible damages for each hospital were calculated based on the most conservative fragility curve and the most pessimistic scenario, which were used to evaluate the seismic vulnerability of hospitals and health care systems for different damage states. After zoning the damage of therapeutic areas of Tehran, it was observed that at least 2% to 10% damage occurred in all hospitals of Tehran, and none of the healthcare centers would remain structurally undamaged after a strong earthquake with the moment magnitude of 7 or more. In addition, the healthcare buildings could be prone to significant structural damage, especially in southern parts, which necessitates proactive management plans for Tehran metropolitan area. © 2021 by the authors.

19647,"Predictive model for seismic vulnerability assessment of churches based on the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake Seismic events that struck Italy in the last years had a dramatic impact on historical and cultural heritage. Damage occurred on existing masonry buildings, in particular on churches, stressed out the need to better understand the seismic behaviour of this type of constructions as well as to define more appropriate mitigation strategies to be applied at large scale. This study deals with a predictive methodology for vulnerability assessment of churches in large territorial areas. Focusing the attention on three naves churches of Abruzzi, the paper proposes modifications and integrations of an existing methodology taken by literature. These modifications are defined through a calibration procedure based on damage observation of 64 three naves churches located at different distances from the epicentre of the 2009 earthquake. The proposed model is employed to predict damage level distribution for different earthquake intensities, allowing fragility curves to be plotted and therefore potential damage scenarios to be represented.

17866,"Flood susceptibility modelling using advanced ensemble machine learning models Floods are one of nature's most destructive disasters because of the immense damage to land, buildings, and human fatalities. It is difficult to forecast the areas that are vulnerable to flash flooding due to the dynamic and complex nature of the flash floods. Therefore, earlier identification of flash flood susceptible sites can be performed using advanced machine learning models for managing flood disasters. In this study, we applied and assessed two new hybrid ensemble models, namely Dagging and Random Subspace (RS) coupled with Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) which are the other three state-of-the-art machine learning models for modelling flood susceptibility maps at the Teesta River basin, the northern region of Bangladesh. The application of these models includes twelve flood influencing factors with 413 current and former flooding points, which were transferred in a GIS environment. The information gain ratio, the multicollinearity diagnostics tests were employed to determine the association between the occurrences and flood influential factors. For the validation and the comparison of these models, for the ability to predict the statistical appraisal measures such as Freidman, Wilcoxon signed-rank, and t-paired tests and Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) were employed. The value of the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of ROC was above 0.80 for all models. For flood susceptibility modelling, the Dagging model performs superior, followed by RF, the ANN, the SVM, and the RS, then the several benchmark models. The approach and solution-oriented outcomes outlined in this paper will assist state and local authorities as well as policy makers in reducing flood-related threats and will also assist in the implementation of effective mitigation strategies to mitigate future damage.

18876,"Microzonation of seismic risk in a low-rise Latin American city based on the macroseismic evaluation of the vulnerability of residential buildings: Colima city, Mexico A macroseismic methodology of seismic risk microzonation in a low-rise city based on the vulnerability of residential buildings is proposed and applied to Colima city, Mexico. The seismic risk microzonation for Colima consists of two elements: the mapping of residential blocks according to their vulnerability level and the calculation of an expert-opinion based damage probability matrix (DPM) for a given level of earthquake intensity and a given type of residential block. A specified exposure time to the seismic risk for this zonation is equal to the interval between two destructive earthquakes. The damage probability matrices were calculated for three types of urban buildings and five types of residential blocks in Colima. It was shown that only 9% of 1409 residential blocks are able to resist to the Modify Mercalli (MM) intensity VII and VIII earthquakes without significant damage. The proposed DPM-2007 is in good accordance with the experimental damage curves based on the macroseismic evaluation of 3332 residential buildings in Colima that was carried out after the 21 January 2003 intensity MM VII earthquake.

22035,"Typological fragility curves for RC buildings: influence of damage index and building sample selection The recent earthquakes occurred in the last years in Italy registered a great number of casualties and large economic losses. In this perspective, the effective seismic risk assessment has become crucial for the Government mitigation policies that have to allocate the limited economic sources for the risk reduction. In this paper, data collected after the 2012 Emilia and the 2009 L'Aquila, Italy, earthquakes were used to derive novel fragility curves for RC frame buildings classes. Compared to previous studies, different aspects affecting the fragility curves parameters were investigated. First of all, data are completed accounting for the presence of undamaged buildings that are generally uninspected after the seismic events, considering alternative criteria to complete the database. Then, the influence of the building damage index definition was considered by selecting four damage indices available in the literature that allow converting the damage data collected with the post-earthquake form into one of the five damage states, according to the European macroseismic scale. Separate sets of fragility curves, as a function of peak ground acceleration, were developed for the building stock of the two regions. The results reveal that the database correction with the uninspected buildings is relevant to avoid the overestimation of the exceedance probability, especially at lower peak ground acceleration values, resulting in less steep curves. Then, the building damage indices accounting for the damage of both structural and non-structural elements led to a higher exceedance probability with respect to damage indices based on damage of only structural elements, especially for the lower damage states. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd Census data  Completeness ratio  Damage index  Emilia earthquake  L'Aquila earthquake  Observational data  Vulnerability assessment Buildings  Damage detection  Losses  Population statistics  Risk assessment  Structural analysis  Building damage  Census data  Completeness ratio  Damage index  Damage state  Emilium earthquake  Fragility curves  L'aquila earthquakes  Observational data  Vulnerability assessments  Earthquakes",Typological fragility curves for RC buildings: influence of damage index and building sample selection,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03084929355975398,0.3436056551573502,0.14744701743741598,0.007400628842155133,Empirical
16194,"Collapse mode-based fragility curves against tsunami for low- and medium-rise reinforced concrete buildings This paper proposes tsunami fragility curves for low- and medium-rise RC building considering collapse modes, such as overturning and sliding, based on the examination of the database of damaged buildings during the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake. Log normal distribution is assumed for fragility curves, and the median and logarithmic standard deviation are estimated. One of difficulties for mode-based fragility estimation is that it is impossible to identify the most contributing collapse mode beforehand. The maximum likelihood method using multi-nominal likelihood function (Nakamura & Ugata, 2009) is extended, so that no assumption is needed about the relationship between each collapse mode. Proposed fragility curves include statistical uncertainty considering limited number of damaged buildings in the database. 2011 Tohoku Earthquake  Collapse mode  Fragility curves  Maximum likelihood method  Tsunami Concrete buildings  Earthquakes  Normal distribution  Tsunamis  2011 off the pacific coast of tohoku earthquakes  2011 tohoku earthquakes  Collapse mode  Fragility curves  Likelihood functions  Log-normal distribution  Maximum likelihood methods  Statistical uncertainty  Collapsible tubes",Collapse mode-based fragility curves against tsunami for low- and medium-rise reinforced concrete buildings,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35956789122905,0.27455724325355957,0.007373077919765868,0.01469334771681111,Analytical
16965,"Dimensionless fragility analysis of seismic acceleration demands through low-order building models This paper deals with the estimation of fragility functions for acceleration-sensitive components of buildings subjected to earthquake action. It considers ideally coherent pulses as well as real non-pulselike ground-motion records applied to continuous building models formed by a flexural beam and a shear beam in tandem. The study advances the idea of acceleration-based dimensionless fragility functions and describes the process of their formulation. It demonstrates that the mean period of the Fourier Spectrum, Tm, is associated with the least dispersion in the predicted dimensionless mean demand. Likewise, peak ground acceleration, PGA-, and peak ground velocity, PGV-based length scales are found to be almost equally appropriate for obtaining efficient ‘universal’ descriptions of maximum floor accelerations. Finally, this work also shows that fragility functions formulated in terms of dimensionless Π-terms have a superior performance in comparison with those based on conventional non-dimensionless terms (like peak or spectral acceleration values). This improved efficiency is more evident for buildings dominated by global flexural type lateral deformation over the whole intensity range and for large peak floor acceleration levels in structures with shear-governed behaviour. The suggested dimensionless fragility functions can offer a ‘universal’ description of the fragility of acceleration-sensitive components and constitute an efficient tool for a rapid seismic assessment of building contents in structures behaving at, or close to, yielding which form the biggest share in large (regional) building stock evaluations. © 2019, The Author(s).

17362,"Empirical seismic fragility assessment with explicit modeling of spatial ground motion variability The earthquake risk to a group of structures can be managed effectively only if accurate fragility models are available. Fragility models are utilized for estimating the likelihood of specific damage states being sustained by the structures given that they are subjected to a specific ground motion intensity. In this study, a new framework is proposed for establishing empirical fragility models for groups of structures based on observed damage distribution. The novelty of the proposed framework method is that it explicitly takes into account the uncertainty arising from the absence of instrumental recordings of the peak motion intensities that had affected the considered structures. Correlation structure of the unknown peak motion intensities experienced by the affected structures and the known peak motions measured at the strong motion stations sites are utilized for this purpose. This correlation structure is established using geospatial ground motion variability models. As an example of the application of the proposed framework, fragility models for multi-story reinforced concrete moment resisting frame buildings are presented. In this application, the damage observations made after the November 17th, 1999 M7.1 Düzce and the May 1st, 2003 M6.4 Bingöl earthquakes that occurred in Turkey are considered.

Our study is based on the published data from more than 50 high rises and super high rises.

By considering the structural primary periods, buildings are categories into different height groups. Geological conditions of the building site such as soil types, site characteristic periods, are also considered. The vulnerability analysis for high rises uses response spectrum displacement as seismic ground motion input, since the structures have comparatively long natural period. Statistics and regression analysis of linear least square method are used. The relationship between the maximum story drift ratio and response spectrum displacement is established.

17900,"Fragility analysis for sensor fault detection of smart structures This paper investigate the impact of sensor fault/failures within smart control systems under a variety of earthquake signals using seismic fragility curves. Seismic fragility analysis can be used as a tool for evaluating the performance and vulnerability of smart structures under earthquake events. It would play an important role in estimating seismic losses and in the decision making process based on control performance during seismic events. The seismic fragility curves are developed using a closed form equation. Seismic demand model is constructed with a Bayesian updating approach while seismic capacity of smart structures is estimated based on the approximate structural performance of semi-active control structures. Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) of ground motion is used as a measure of earthquake intensity. To demonstrate the proposed methodology, a three-story building employing a highly nonlinear hysteretic Magnetorheological (MR) damper is analyzed to estimate seismic fragility of smart control system. Then the developed fragility curves for the smart structure are compared with those for the control system with faulty sensing information while the responses of the uncontrolled structure are used as a baseline.

15192,"A Methodology for Seismic Loss Estimation in Urban Regions Based on Ground-Motion Simulations Seismic vulnerability assessment of residential buildings in regions of high seismicity is an interdisciplinary problem requiring major inputs from fields of seismology and earthquake engineering. The basic two components of loss estimation methods are information on regional seismicity and building stock. This study presents a realistic loss estimation methodology where the first component, input ground motions, is obtained from regional ground-motion simulations using the stochastic finite-fault technique. The second component, building vulnerability information, on the other hand, is taken into account using fragility analyses. Introducing the ground-motion intensity parameters obtained from simulations to the fragility curves, we obtain seismic loss distribution in a region. In this study, we demonstrate the loss estimation methodology with an application to three northwestern cities in Turkey (Duzce, Bolu, and Kaynasli) that experienced two major earthquakes (M-w 7.4 and M-w 7.1) in less than three months in 1999. We initially verify the methodology with comparisons of observed and estimated damage ratios for the 12 November 1999 (M-w 7.1) Duzce earthquake. Later, we present the estimated damage ratios under scenario earthquakes in the region for a magnitude range of M-w 5.5-7.5. M-w 6.5 is predicted to be the threshold magnitude for the cities of Duzce and Kaynasli where more than 60% of the building stock experience moderate and heavy damage. Because Bolu is at a farther distance from the fault plane, less damage is estimated for M-w 5.5-7.0 than those in the other centers. For M-w 7.5, all three cities are predicted to experience substantial rates of heavy damage and collapse.

16914,"Development of hybrid earthquake vulnerability functions for typical residential buildings in Iran Residential building stock in Iran, with its diverse types, is exposed to different earthquake events each year that necessities the implementation of disaster risk reduction measures. Conducting seismic risk assessment studies, on the other hand, is crucial as one of the main perquisites of any earthquake disaster risk reduction efforts. Seismic risk assessment is an approach that requires dependable fragility or vulnerability functions, and the more valid these models are, the more realistic the risk assessment results would be. The main objective of the current study is to provide new hybrid seismic vulnerability models for typical residential buildings in Iran. In this regard, existing peer-reviewed fragility or vulnerability models are utilized as basic models besides the damage records of recent earthquake events in Iran. The logic tree approach is used to combine the basic models, and 26 seismic vulnerability models are developed based on three main attributes of material type, construction quality, and building height. The developed models are functions of PGA and are in the form of the cumulative lognormal distribution function. Additionally, the most recent national census data (2016) are utilized to combine vulnerability models via the logic tree approach and develop quality-independent vulnerability models that can be used in circumstances when precise information about the construction quality of buildings is not available. Developed models are finally validated using the real building damage data collected from the records of recent significant earthquake events in Iran.

18399,"Improving flood damage assessments in data-scarce areas by retrieval of building characteristics through UAV image segmentation and machine learning - a case study of the 2019 floods in southern Malawi Reliable information on building stock and its vulnerability is important for understanding societal exposure to floods. Unfortunately, developing countries have less access to and availability of this information. Therefore, calculations for flood damage assessments have to use the scarce information available, often aggregated on a national or district level. This study aims to improve current assessments of flood damage by extracting individual building characteristics and estimate damage based on the buildings' vulnerability. We carry out an object-based image analysis (OBIA) of high-resolution (11 cm ground sample distance) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery to outline building footprints. We then use a support vector machine learning algorithm to classify the delineated buildings. We combine this information with local depth-damage curves to estimate the economic damage for three villages affected by the 2019 January river floods in the southern Shire Basin in Malawi and compare this to a conventional, pixel-based approach using aggregated land use to denote exposure. The flood extent is obtained from satellite imagery (Sentinel-1) and corresponding water depths determined by combining this with elevation data. The results show that OBIA results in building footprints much closer to OpenStreetMap data, in which the pixel-based approach tends to overestimate. Correspondingly, the estimated total damage from the OBIA is lower (EUR 10 140) compared to the pixel-based approach (EUR 15 782). A sensitivity analysis illustrates that uncertainty in the derived damage curves is larger than in the hazard or exposure data. This research highlights the potential for detailed and local damage assessments using UAV imagery to determine exposure and vulnerability in flood damage and risk assessments in data-poor regions.

12966,"Fragility curves based on data from the 2011 Tohoku-oki Tsunami in Ishinomaki City, with discussion of parameters influencing building damage The 63,605 damaged buildings from the 2011 Tohoku-oki tsunami in Ishinomaki were used to develop 52 fragility curves using linear regression. The data comprise the damage level and the measured inundation depth for each building. In agreement with previous studies, the present results indicate that reinforced concrete and steel buildings with three stories or more perform better under tsunami loading. Performance with respect to their intended function was found to depend mainly on structural material. Moreover, based on Japan's design code for earthquake-resistant buildings, buildings constructed after 1981 do not display a better performance compared to more recent constructions. Finally, the results show that for the same inundation depth, a higher damage probability exists along a ria coast due to higher flow velocities, confirmed by numerical simulation and survivor videos. These new findings are useful for building damage assessment, town reconstruction, and comparison of vulnerability functions in future studies. © 2015, Earthquake Engineering Research Institute.

18286,"Hybrid fragility curve derivation of buildings based on post-earthquake reconnaissance data This study proposes a new hybrid method that uses both of post-earthquake reconnaissance data and numerical analysis results based on a finite element (FE) model. As the uncertainty of a capacity threshold for a structural damage state needs to be estimated carefully, in the proposed method, the probabilistic distribution parameters of capacity thresholds are evaluated based on post-earthquake reconnaissance data. Subsequently, the hybrid fragility curves were derived for several damage states using the updated distribution parameters of capacity thresholds. To illustrate the detailed process of the proposed hybrid method, it was applied to piloti-type reinforce concrete (RC) buildings which were affected by the 2017 Pohang earthquake, Korea. In the example, analytical fragility curves were derived first, and then hybrid fragility curves were obtained using the distribution parameters of capacity thresholds which were updated based on actual post-earthquake reconnaissance data about the Pohang city. The results showed that the seismic fragility estimates approached to the empirical failure probability at 0.27 g PGA, corresponding to the ground motion intensity of the Pohang earthquake. To verify the proposed method, hybrid fragility curves were derived with the hypothetical reconnaissance data sets created based on assumed distribution parameters with errors of 10% and 1%. As a result, it was identified that the distribution parameters accurately converged to the assumed parameters and the case of 1% error had better convergence than that of 10% error.

18075,"Fragility Functions for Tall URM Buildings around Early 20th Century in Lisbon. Part 1: Methodology and Application at Building Level The article proposes a procedure for the derivation of fragility functions for unreinforced masonry buildings considering the in-plane and out-of-plane response. Different approaches are considered for the generation of the corresponding fragility functions and for the evaluation of the propagation of uncertainties. The contributions for the dispersion of the fragility functions account for the variability in the definition of the capacity, the aleatory uncertainty in the definition of the seismic demand and the aleatory uncertainty in the definition of the modified/floor response spectrum, when the local mechanisms are located in the upper level of the building. In the end, the individual fragility curves are properly combined in order to define a single fragility curve for the class of buildings. As a case study, the procedure is applied to the assessment of one of the most vulnerable unreinforced masonry buildings constructed in the early 20th century in Lisbon, considering a typical prototype building with five storeys high. Results for a seismic event, as defined in the earthquake-resistant code for Lisbon, indicate that the typical building has about 50% probability of having heavy damage and about 30% probability of collapse. © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

As-recorded seismic sequences in different regions around the world are employed and fiber-based modeling approach that captures degradation in concrete and reinforcing steel materials is used.

21170,"Seismic vulnerability assessment of precast RC industrial buildings in Turkey In seismic risk assessment, the fragility curves are commonly used to express the probability of exceedance of the predetermined damage states as the function of the earthquake ground motion parameter for structures. In this paper, the seismic vulnerability of single story precast reinforced concrete industrial buildings located in the organized industrial zones in Turkey were studied. The 273 existing buildings located in the different regions of Turkey were surveyed to get their geometry and structural parameters and 80 model types were identified. The effects of the structural parameters on the structural damage were studied via the fragility curves. The damage index parameter was used in the analytically obtained fragility curves for the four damage states as a function of spectral acceleration. Two sets of ground motion records were used representing the soft and stiff site conditions in the incremental dynamic analysis. The aim of this study is to obtain mean fragility curves for the three main classes of industrial precast reinforced concrete building structures, namely the Poor, Typical and the Superior. The structural parameters of stiffness, ductility and strength were used in the classification of the buildings. The study has focused on the probable maximum loss estimation for the above three building classes. The results indicate a good compatibility with the observed damages in the past earthquakes. It is believed that the proposed study can be used for seismic risk assessment based on the spectral acceleration levels experienced by these single story precast reinforced concrete industrial buildings. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Damage index  Fragility curves  Incremental dynamic analysis  Precast structure  Seismic vulnerability Concrete buildings  Concrete construction  Damage detection  Earthquakes  Office buildings  Precast concrete  Risk assessment  Structural analysis  Earthquake ground motions  Incremental dynamic analysis  Precast reinforced concrete  Probability of exceedance  Seismic risk assessment  Seismic vulnerability  Spectral acceleration  Structural parameter  Reinforced concrete  building  dynamic analysis  earthquake damage  ground motion  hazard assessment  reinforced concrete  seismic hazard  vulnerability  Turkey  Meleagris gallopavo",Seismic vulnerability assessment of precast RC industrial buildings in Turkey,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20190963608975326,0.05214726986145801,0.03719417075474126,0.007249373513073965,Analytical
12873,"Empirical fragility curves of buildings in northern Miyagi prefecture during the 2011 off the pacific coast of Tohoku earthquake In this study, empirical fragility curves expressed in terms of relationship between damage ratio indices of buildings and ground motion indices were developed in northern Miyagi prefecture located in nearfield areas during the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake. The ground motion indices were evaluated from observed ground motions at strongmotion stations and estimated at sites at which no strong-motion accelerometers were deployed during the mainshock. The ground motions at the noninstrumental sites were estimated using the empirical Green’s function method based on bedrock motions inverted from observed records on surfaces from small events that occurred inside the source fault, transfer functions due to underground velocity structures identified from microtremor H/V spectral ratios, and a short-period source model of the mainshock. The findings indicated that the empirical fragility curves as functions of Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) instrumental seismic intensity during the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake almost corresponded to those during the 1995Kobe Earthquake and the seven disastrous earthquakes that occurred between 2003 and 2008. However, the empirical fragility curves as functions of peak ground velocity were the lowest. A possible reason for this is that the response spectra of the ground motions in the period ranging from 1.0 s to 1.5 s were small during the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake. Another reason could be the seismic resistant capacities of buildings in the studied districts involved during the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake exceeded those in the cities affected during the 1995 Kobe Earthquake. © 2016 Fuji Technology Press Ltd.
