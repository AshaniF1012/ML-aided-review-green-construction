12508,"The Pacific coast of Colombia has witnessed several tsunami events in the last century. However, the physical damage to structures at the time was not recorded, even when these events have brought overwhelming destruction to coastal communities. This lack of data increases uncertainties when assessing future tsunami impacts. Nonetheless, other regions of the world, which have been also affected by tsunami, have collected damage information that has been used to build empirical tsunami fragility functions. Based on a demand parameter, such as the tsunami inundation depth, a fragility function expresses the probability of building damage. Hence, regions with no recent tsunami damage cannot develop empirical fragility functions since post-disaster damage survey data is not available. One alternative for these regions is to develop analytical fragility functions out of computational nonlinear structural analysis. Reinforced concrete buildings and palafitte houses are selected to perform a comparative analysis of collapse damage assessment expressed in empirical and analytical fragility functions. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

12510,"A fragility function shows the building damage likelihood based on a demand parameter such as the tsunami flow depth. While empirical fragility functions have been developed by using postdisaster damage survey data, regions with no recent tsunami damage cannot develop these estimations. Alternatively, analytical fragility functions could be developed to fill this gap. Along the Colombian Pacific coast, several tsunami events have occurred; however, the aftermath resulting from the structure physical damage was not recorded. Fortunately, other regions of the have collected tsunami damage information, which has been analyzed and represented in terms of empirical fragility functions. This paper provides a comparative study of empirical and analytical tsunami fragility functions. It is focused on the analytical fragility functions developed for typical structures in Tumaco, Colombia and on empirical fragility curves taken from damage survey data of recent tsunami events. The differences in the assessments of the damage produced by the two methods in the case of a two-story reinforced concrete building in Tumaco is discussed herein. As a result of the comparison, it was shown that the structures in Tumaco have higher collapse probabilities at lower flow depths than structures in other places along the Pacific and Indian Oceans. © 2020 Japan Society of Civil Engineers.","A comparative study of empirical and analytical fragility functions for the assessment of tsunami building damage in Tumaco, Colombia",2020,analytical fragility curves; empirical fragility curves; nonlinear structural analysis; Tsunami damage,Concrete buildings; Reinforced concrete; Surveys; Tsunamis; Collapse probabilities; Comparative studies; Fragility curves; Fragility function; Nonlinear structural analysis; Physical damages; Tsunami damages; Typical structures; Damage detection,1,1
12512,"In the last decade, probabilistic approaches for flood risk assessment have emerged, often as an extension of more consolidated methods used in probabilistic seismic risk assessment. Nonetheless, only a few studies deal with best-practice methodologies for flood vulnerability assessment and existing approaches lack of an appropriate guidance for their selection. These concerns underline the need for a rational, integrated and complete compendium of all the existing flood-related vulnerability and fragility relationships to be used in a comprehensive probabilistic flood risk assessment framework. Following the same approach used in the guidelines recently developed by the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) Project, this paper presents a preliminary review of the state-of-art regarding existing empirical vulnerability and fragility curves in the context of flood risk. In particular, a worldwide overview is intended in terms of data sources, assets features and also statistical techniques employed for data collection and fitting. The research aims at providing a complete and flexible guide for selection of vulnerability and fragility curves for building structures. A discussion on data sources, building classification and considered features, and damage scales is presented, in order to evaluate the reliability, and at the same time the limitations, of different approaches and provide recommendation for future studies.",A compendium of existing vulnerability and fragility relationships for flood: Preliminary results,2015,None,Classification (of information); Risk assessment; Building structure; Earthquake modeling; Flood risk assessments; Flood vulnerabilities; Fragility curves; Probabilistic approaches; Probabilistic seismic risk assessments; Statistical techniques; Floods,1,1
12518,"Compound natural hazards likeEl Ninoevents cause high damage to society, which to manage requires reliable risk assessments. Damage modelling is a prerequisite for quantitative risk estimations, yet many procedures still rely on expert knowledge, and empirical studies investigating damage from compound natural hazards hardly exist. A nationwide building survey in Peru after theEl Ninoevent 2017 - which caused intense rainfall, ponding water, flash floods and landslides - enables us to apply data-mining methods for statistical groundwork, using explanatory features generated from remote sensing products and open data. We separate regions of different dominant characteristics through unsupervised clustering, and investigate feature importance rankings for classifying damage via supervised machine learning. Besides the expected effect of precipitation, the classification algorithms select the topographic wetness index as most important feature, especially in low elevation areas. The slope length and steepness factor ranks high for mountains and canyons. Partial dependence plots further hint at amplified vulnerability in rural areas.

12523,"The current research is targeted to develop the analytical fragility relationships of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings in high-intensity seismic zones by considering the effects of higher structural modes to reduce the computational effort. A new framework is presented in the study to assess the vulnerability in terms of the fragility relationships that can consider the modal response of individual modes in a building structure. The developed methodology considers the uncoupled modes of a structure employing a nonlinear single degree of freedom structures and defines distinct limit states for each mode separately. By using the presented methodology, the response of higher modes can be incorporated in the fragility assessment. For elucidation, a two-story reinforced concrete (RC) school building structure is selected from seismic zone 4 of Pakistan. In the first place, its vulnerability is assessed by developing fragility relationships using dynamic response history analysis of full three Dimensional nonlinear analytical models, subsequently, the fragility relationships are developed using the presented methodology by considering the first two modes of the structure. Afterward, a comparison has been made between the developed fragility curves from both of the methodologies. The results prove the effectiveness, swiftness, and the simplicity of the established methodology for carrying out the vulnerability assessments without compromising any accuracy.

12525,"A fragility curve is a function that expresses the probability of failure of a structure or component as a function of the intensity of external aggression. This paper proposes a general framework for the development of analytical fragility functions from data based on the copula approach. Such a model allows for any kinds of marginal distributions and dependence structures so that it can be applied to various types of fragility data, analytical or empirical. The fragility function is then derived from the joint distribution of intensity and damage measures. The Bayesian information criterion is used to select the most plausible model among the candidate joint distributions, given the data. The practical implementation of the methodology is illustrated by an analytical test case and by the evaluation of seismic fragility curves for a reinforced concrete building. Several candidate marginal distributions, in agreement with the nature and the physical properties of the variables (e.g. common intensity and damage measures take only positive values) are evaluated. In particular, seismic intensity measures are lognormal random variables according to seismological models. This paper is focused on bivariate distributions but the case of vector valued intensity measures can be treated accordingly. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",A general framework for the estimation of analytical fragility functions based on multivariate probability distributions,2017,Conditional probability; Copula; Fragility curve; Performance based earthquake engineering; Time history analysis,Concrete buildings; Damage detection; Earthquake engineering; Highway bridges; Probability; Reinforced concrete; Seismology; Conditional probabilities; Copula; Fragility curves; Performance-based earthquake engineering; Time history analysis; Probability distributions,1,1
12526,"The use of different methods for physical flood vulnerability assessment has evolved over time, from traditional single-parameter stage-damage curves to multi-parameter approaches such as multivariate or indicator-based models. However, despite the extensive implementation of these models in flood risk assessment globally, a considerable gap remains in their applicability to data-scarce regions. Considering that these regions are mostly areas with a limited capacity to cope with disasters, there is an essential need for assessing the physical vulnerability of the built environment and contributing to an improvement of flood risk reduction. To close this gap, we propose linking approaches with reduced data requirements, such as vulnerability indicators (integrating major damage drivers) and damage grades (integrating frequently observed damage patterns). First, we present a review of current studies of physical vulnerability indicators and flood damage models comprised of stage-damage curves and the multivariate methods that have been applied to predict damage grades. Second, we propose a new conceptual framework for assessing the physical vulnerability of buildings exposed to flood hazards that has been specifically tailored for use in data-scarce regions. This framework is operationalized in three steps: (i) developing a vulnerability index, (ii) identifying regional damage grades, and (iii) linking resulting index classes with damage patterns, utilizing a synthetic ""what-if""analysis. The new framework is a first step for enhancing flood damage prediction to support risk reduction in data-scarce regions. It addresses selected gaps in the literature by extending the application of the vulnerability index for damage grade prediction through the use of a synthetic multi-parameter approach. The framework can be adapted to different data-scarce regions and allows for integrating possible modifications to damage drivers and damage grades. © 2020 Author(s).",A generic physical vulnerability model for floods: Review and concept for data-scarce regions,2020,None,conceptual framework; data set; disaster management; flood; flood damage; multivariate analysis; risk assessment; vulnerability,1,1
12528,"“Earthquake’s do kill the people.” It is a clear misconception. Earthquakes never kill, but it is always the constructional failure which makes the situation worse and leads to the loss of life. Earthquake’s root to a huge economic loss apart from the tortuous pain of loss of lives. This calls for the need of seismic strengthening as the circumgyrations are inevitable. Seismic strengthening improves the structural safety but does not reduce the seismic response. Seismic strengthening is a pre-disaster assessment. But the need to study the observance of the existing buildings against the circumgyrations lead to a stew of post-disaster mitigation with pre-disaster planning known as Fragility analysis. Fragility analysis refers to the partial assessment of vulnerability of the buildings subjected to earthquake motions. In this study, the fragility curves are developed with the aid of Incremental dynamic analysis or Nonlinear dynamic analysis conducted on the model. The curves explain the conditional anticipation which outstrip adefinite limit of failure and therefore guesstimate the susceptibility of the structure. Fragility curves are very much useful in seismic loss estimation studies in earth quake prone zones. Two structural models four storey & six storey 3D open frame buildings were considered.The structural models are designed for dead, live and seismic loads according to the Indian Code. A set of 5 Farfield ground motions scaled from 0.1 to 1 with an increment of 0.1 are used in the Incremental dynamic analysis using SAAP2000. Four performance levels, namely Fully Operational (FO), Immediate Occupancy (IO), Life Safety (LS) and Collapse Prevention (CP) were considered and monitored in the analysis using MATLAB. The objective of the study is to develop the fragility curves for a low rise (G+3) and medium rise (G+5) building models using the Graphical User Interface (GUI) in MATLABR2016a considering the four selected performance levels.

12532,"The 2017 Puebla, Mexico, earthquake event led to significant damage in many buildings in Mexico City. In the months following the earthquake, civil engineering students conducted detailed building assessments throughout the city. They collected building damage information and structural characteristics for 340 buildings in the Mexico City urban area, with an emphasis on the Roma and Condesa neighborhoods where they assessed 237 buildings. These neighborhoods are of particular interest due to the availability of seismic records captured by nearby recording stations, and preexisting information from when the neighborhoods were affected by the 1985 Michoacán earthquake. This article presents a case study on developing a damage prediction model using machine learning. It details a framework suitable for working with future post-earthquake observation data. Four algorithms able to perform classification tasks were trialed. Random forest, the best performing algorithm, achieves more than 65% prediction accuracy. The study of the feature importance for the random forest shows that the building location, seismic demand, and building height are the parameters that influence the model output the most. © The Author(s) 2020.","A machine learning damage prediction model for the 2017 Puebla-Morelos, Mexico, earthquake",2020,2017 Puebla Mexico earthquake; damage assessment; damage prediction; machine learning; seismic building damage,Buildings; Damage detection; Decision trees; Earthquakes; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Random forests; Building assessment; Civil engineering students; Classification tasks; Damage prediction models; Earthquake observations; Prediction accuracy; Recording stations; Structural characteristics; Forecasting; algorithm; building; earthquake damage; machine learning; numerical model; prediction; seismic response; Mexico [North America]; Morelos; Puebla [Mexico],1,1
12534,"The study of the seismic vulnerability of Reinforced Concrete (RC) buildings is a topic of large interest for the scientific community and public institutions, who have the task of providing mitigation strategies for the seismic risk for a wide and inhomogeneous portfolio of buildings with very limited economic resources. With this regard, within the research project ReLUIS 2014-2018, typological and structural information about recurrent classes of RC buildings was collected in some municipalities of Puglia, Italy. Based on these data, it has been possible to identify some representative “Index” buildings, characterized by common morphological, mechanical and geometrical features and identified by a set of relevant characteristic parameters having a defined variation within a plausible range. In this paper, based on the available dataset of building information in some municipalities and on the results of seismic vulnerability analyses about residential RC building typologies, the fragility of representative Index buildings has been investigated. In particular, by using the data collected from a previous large-scale investigation performed in the Municipality of Bovino, preliminary regional fragility curves have been derived for of the index buildings previously defined. The significant mechanical parameters have been varied within pre-defined ranges; for each obtained “sample” simulated design has been made deriving the computational model; at last, the assessment has been performed through the development of a pushover-based procedure. The variation of the parameters and their combination have been carried out in order to appraise their influence in the regional seismic fragility. Copyright © 2019 COMPDYN Proceedings.

12536,"The development of accurate seismic fragility curves is a key to effective seismic risk management. This study proposes a new hybrid method to derive the seismic fragility curves of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings. In the first step, nonlinear time-history analyses are conducted to analyze the inter-story drift (ISD) ratios. Based on the analysis results, analytical fragility curves are derived for three damage states of light, moderate, and severe with varying levels of peak ground acceleration (PGA). Subsequently, empirical damage data of RC buildings collected for an actual earthquake is converted to ISD ratios using empirical equations. Lastly, based on the empirical damage data, hybrid fragility curves are derived by updating the median of the ISD ratios for a reference PGA level using Bayesian updating. In addition, to update the median values at other PGA levels including no empirical data, a new scaling factor, which is the ratio of the posterior and prior median values at the reference PGA level, is proposed. To test the proposed method, it is applied to RC buildings in Pohang city, South Korea, which were subjected to a magnitude-5.4 earthquake in 2017. From the comparison of analytical fragility curves with hybrid fragility curves, it is observed that the analytical curves overestimate the seismic vulnerability of the RC buildings, and the proposed method provides hybrid fragility curves successfully. © 2019 European Safety and Reliability Association.

12545,"The intensity and/or frequency of hurricane storms may change due to the impact of potential climate change. This paper presents a probabilistic framework to assess the hurricane damage to residential constructions considering the non-stationarity and correlation in hurricane actions. The framework includes a non-stationary Poisson process of hurricane occurrence, a failure rate function of hurricane damage, and explicit formulas for evaluating the mean and variance of annual hurricane damage. The framework is illustrated using a case study of Miami-Dade County, Florida, where the current probabilistic models of hurricane intensity and occurrence rate were estimated by examining hurricane history in this area. The impacts of time-variant hurricane intensity and time-variant hurricane frequency on building damage are assessed individually using the developed framework.

12549,"Risk-based approaches have been increasingly accepted and operationalized in flood risk management during recent decades. For instance, commercial flood risk models are used by the insurance industry to assess potential losses, establish the pricing of policies and determine reinsurance needs. Despite considerable progress in the development of loss estimation tools since the 1980s, loss estimates still reflect high uncertainties and disparities that often lead to questioning their quality. This requires an assessment of the validity and robustness of loss models as it affects prioritization and investment decision in flood risk management as well as regulatory requirements and business decisions in the insurance industry. Hence, more effort is needed to quantify uncertainties and undertake validations. Due to a lack of detailed and reliable flood loss data, first order validations are difficult to accomplish, so that model comparisons in terms of benchmarking are essential. It is checked if the models are informed by existing data and knowledge and if the assumptions made in the models are aligned with the existing knowledge. When this alignment is confirmed through validation or benchmarking exercises, the user gains confidence in the models. Before these benchmarking exercises are feasible, however, a cohesive survey of existing knowledge needs to be undertaken. With that aim, this work presents a review of flood loss-or flood vulnerability-relationships collected from the public domain and some professional sources. Our survey analyses 61 sources consisting of publications or software packages, of which 47 are reviewed in detail. This exercise results in probably the most complete review of flood loss models to date containing nearly a thousand vulnerability functions. These functions are highly heterogeneous and only about half of the loss models are found to be accompanied by explicit validation at the time of their proposal. This paper exemplarily presents an approach for a quantitative comparison of disparate models via the reduction to the joint input variables of all models. Harmonization of models for benchmarking and comparison requires profound insight into the model structures, mechanisms and underlying assumptions.

12554,"Ground motion records are generally required to develop fragility curves which are utilized in seismic loss estimation studies for earthquake prone zones. These records could be 'real', i.e. recorded acceleration time series or 'simulated' records consistent with the regional seismicity and produced using alternative simulation techniques. This study mainly concentrates on development of fragility curves for masonry buildings located in Erzincan (eastern Turkey) using 'simulated' ground motion records and evaluates the suitability of these fragilities by comparing with the curves developed utilizing 'real' records. To generate a set of scenario earthquakes by using regional seismicity parameters of Erzincan, stochastic finite-fault methodology has been employed as the simulation technique. The 'real' records, on the other hand, are selected from Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center's NGA-West2 ground motion database and chosen to be compatible with the seismological characteristics of the region of interest. The records are imposed on a set of masonry buildings (with 1-, 2-, 3-stories and 3 different quality classes) representing the building stock in Erzincan. To assess the dynamic responses of the structures, nonlinear time history analyses utilizing equivalent single-degree-of-freedom systems are performed on OpenSees platform. Afterwards, fragility curves for three limit states (Immediate Occupancy, Life Safety and Collapse Prevention) are generated.

12572,"The incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) is a powerful methodology that can be easily extended for calculating probabilistic seismic damage curves. These curves are metadata to assess the seismic risk of structures. Although this methodology requires a relevant computational effort, it should be the reference to correctly estimate the seismic risk of structures. Nevertheless, it would be of high practical interest to have a simpler methodology, based for instance on the pushover analysis (PA), to obtain similar results to those based on IDA. In this article, PA is used to obtain probabilistic seismic damage curves from the stiffness degradation and the energy of the nonlinear part of the capacity curve. A fully probabilistic methodology is tackled by means of Monte Carlo simulations with the purpose of establishing that the results based on the simplified proposed approach are compatible with those obtained with the IDA. Comparisons between the results of both approaches are included for a low- to midrise reinforced concrete building.

12574,"The tornado risk assessment methodology currently used by both private and public agencies utilizes empirically derived loss models that rely on historical claims data for predicting future effects of tornadoes. The accuracy of these empirical models is dependent on many factors, including the quality and quantity of available historical data, accuracy of the tornado intensity models, and the universality of applying those empirical models from one region to another. A more rigorous approach may be the development of engineering-based damage assessment models, made applicable to construction in any region and to any tornado that varies in size and strength. This chapter presents a framework for an engineering-based tornado damage assessment (ETDA) for low-rise buildings. The model predicts damage on the most vulnerable sector of the built environment, nonengineered residential buildings. The model components include a translating tornado vortex model, a tornado-induced wind load calculation approach, a probabilistic wind-borne debris impact model, and a time-variant model for internal pressure changes within the structure. The time evolution of structural damage to a building is determined using successive time steps of component level wind loading vs. structural resistance as the tornado translates past the building. The output of this model is a percentage damage index for each component and the overall building damage ratio. The ETDA model is illustrated using four houses damaged in the 2011 Joplin, MO, tornado. Predicted damage using the ETDA model is in good agreement (within 15?%) of post-tornado damage observations reported by the third author. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",An engineering-based approach to predict Tornado-induced damage,2016,None,Buildings; Risk assessment; Structural analysis; Tornadoes; Damage assessment models; Low-rise buildings; Residential building; Risk assessment methodologies; Structural damages; Structural resistance; Tornado intensity; Tornado-induced wind loads; Damage detection,1,1

12591,"Hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones (hereafter referred to as ""hurricanes"") continue to have a significant impact on residential developments around the world. As more populations continue to migrate into the path of these costly natural hazards, it is becoming increasingly important to develop new methods to quantify damage to residential developments in order to increase the resilience of communities. One way to increase community resilience from a structural engineering standpoint is to limit the damage incurred by a residential development subjected to a hurricane wind event. Previous post-hurricane damage assessments have illustrated the integrity of the building envelope plays a key role in reducing or even eliminating the significant losses typically associated with hurricane wind hazards. In order to assess the post-hurricane state of a residential development, three failure modes common to residential building envelopes are implemented using the axioms of probability to implement an analytical damage quantification method. Results illustrating the implementation of the proposed method will be presented using a probabilistic building envelope failure assessment model applied to a residential development subjected to ten synthetic hurricane events each with a maximum mean wind speed equivalent to a 700-year return period wind speed. Benefits are twofold, as this research provides (1) a useful tool for assessing the state of physical residential developments with information readily available after post-hurricane damage assessments, and (2) the ability to determine the temporal status of a residential development during the recovery process, which is crucial to implement community life-cycle resilience assessments.",Analytical damage quantification method for residential developments subjected to hurricane wind hazards,2015,None,Hazards; Housing; Hurricanes; Probability; Safety engineering; Solar buildings; Storms; Wind; Wind effects; Building envelopes; Community resiliences; Damage quantification; Failure assessment; Hurricane damage; Recovery process; Residential building; Residential development; Damage detection,1,1
12592,"M. Djamil Hospital is the largest public medical facility in Padang area with over 800 patient beds. The magnitude 7.6 Western Sumatra earthquake of September 30, 2009 caused the first floor of one housing outpatient services collapsed. Padang city is located in West Sumatra province which is recorded as an earthquake and tsunami prone area in Indonesia. Risk reduction strategy can be implemented by assessing the vulnerability of building through fragility curve. In this study, the fragility curve was carried out to an existing Maternity and Childrens's M. Djamil Hospital building due to earthquake and tsunami in sequence. Building's structural was modelled in ETABS v. 17 and analyzed by using Pushover analysis and Nonlinear Time History analysis. This structural model was subjected through a total of 40 ground motion data from El Centro, Northridge, Kobe and Padang. Each ground motion data was normalized from 0.2g to 2.0g of peak ground acceleration and continued with tsunami load. Analysis results consist of drift at yield point and structure maximum drift, which are then generated into a fragility curve based on Hazus standard. The result of earthquake fragility curve represents that the probability of slight damage level is 100%, moderate 100%, extensive 92% and collapse 5.4%.

12595,"The prediction of damages caused by a tsunami over a large coastal area is a complex problem. One of the issues is the evaluation of the structural damage to buildings and infrastructures. A tsunami is preceded by a ground motion, both are caused by an earthquake. The coastal structures are hit, within a short period of time by both phenomena. In this study, we developed a method to build fragility curves for reinforced concrete structures subject to tsunami.

12599,"Harbours are crucial assets for the sustainment and development of human activities. The recent devastating tsunami events as well as the increasing number of people, structures and economic activities being exposed to tsunami hazards revealed the need for the estimation of the effects of tsunami wave on seaport structures. However, only a limited number of tools to estimate the potential impacts of tsunami are available until now. This study aims at developing analytical tsunami fragility functions for some representative typologies of seaport structures in Greece. In particular, low-code moment resisting frame (MRF) and dual reinforced concrete (RC) buildings of various heights, and a typical warehouse are considered in the analysis. A numerical investigation is performed considering different combinations of tsunami loads based on FEMA P646 (2008) [1] recommendations for gradually increasing tsunami inundation depths and for the various structure typologies. To minimize the uncertainties related to the definition of damage limit states, tsunami nonlinear static analyses are performed and appropriate tsunami capacity curves are derived for the considered structures. Structural limit states are defined on tsunami capacity curves in terms of threshold values of material strain. For the complete damage state, shear failure is also considered, since the collapse of structures may be caused by the occurrence of either a flexural or shear failure in structural components. Fragility curves are numerically calculated for the different damage states using nonlinear regression analysis. They could be used within a probabilistic risk assessment framework to assess the vulnerability of low-code RC buildings and typical warehouses exposed to tsunami hazard along European-Mediterranean and other regions of similar facilities worldwide. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Analytical tsunami fragility curves for seaport RC buildings and steel light frame warehouses,2018,Inundation depth; RC buildings; Shear failure; Steel light frame warehouses; Structural damage states; Tsunami capacity curves; Tsunami fragility curves,Concrete buildings; Economics; Floods; Hazards; Ports and harbors; Regression analysis; Reinforced concrete; Risk assessment; Static analysis; Structural analysis; Structural frames; Uncertainty analysis; Warehouses; Capacity curves; Fragility curves; Inundation depth; Light frames; RC buildings; Shear failure; Structural damages; Tsunamis; building; damage mechanics; failure analysis; reinforced concrete; shear stress; structural analysis,1,1
12600,"A damage data database of 131 reinforced concrete (RC) buildings, collected after 2009 L'Aquila (Italy) earthquake, is employed for the evaluation of observational fragility curves. The specific interpretation of damage data allowed carrying out fragility curves for slight, moderate, and heavy damage, (i.e., DS1, DS2, and DS3), defined according to EMS 98 macroseismic scale. Observational fragility curves are then employed for the calibration of FAST analytical methodology. FAST method is a spectral based approach, meant for the estimate of fragility curves of infilled RC buildings up to DS3, evaluated, again, according to EMS98. Kullback-Leibler divergence is employed to check the matching between analytical and observational fragilities. FAST input variables can vary in quite large ranges and the calibration provides a valuable suggestion for the application of the method in other cases in which field damage data are not available. Results showed that optimizing values, for the input variables calibrated, are in good agreement with typical values assumed in literature. Analytical results showed a very satisfactory agreement with observational data for DS2 and DS3, while systematical underestimation was found for the case of DS1.",Analytical versus observational fragilities: the case of Pettino (L'Aquila) damage data database,2015,L'Aquila earthquake; EMS98; Observational fragilities; FAST method; Infills,REINFORCED-CONCRETE BUILDINGS; PERFORMANCE; VULNERABILITY; EARTHQUAKE; FRAMES,1,1
12601,"The latest earthquake disasters have highlighted, once again, poor functioning of the existing masonry structures, and the need to intervene all these structures which have been designed with old regulatory criteria, inadequate or those that have been built before the emergence of design codes. The significant progress made in new criteria of earthquake resistant design, should be extended to all the existing structures, it is therefore essential to identify the degree of seismic performance. Unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings represent a significant portion of the residential structures in Algeria, accounting for more than 60% of existing buildings. In addition to significant population, the brittle nature of URM buildings further supports a thorough consideration of seismic response given the susceptibility to severe failure modes. Currently, there is a pressing need for analytically based fragility curves for URM buildings. In order to improve the estimation of damage state probabilities through the development of simulation-based masonry fragilities, an extensive literature survey is conducted on pushover analysis of URM structures. Structural response is evaluated using an advanced capacity spectrum method. Capacity, demand, and response are thus derived analytically and response data is used to generate an improved and uniform set of fragility curves for use in risk assessment. Seismic fragility curves are expressed in multiple forms for wide range of use in loss-assessment applications. Results are discussed and compared with other relationships developed in the literature. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.",Analytically Derived Fragility Curves and Damage Assessment of Masonrybuildings,2018,None,Concrete buildings; Earthquakes; Masonry materials; Risk assessment; Seismic design; Capacity spectrum method; Earthquake disaster; Earthquake-resistant design; Residential structures; Seismic fragility curves; Seismic Performance; Structural response; Unreinforced masonry; Damage detection,1,1
12607,"In the past few years, the construction of multi-storey timber buildings has increased significantly in locations where high-intensity ground motions are likely to occur. On the other hand, the fast development of wood engineered products, as glued-laminated timber (GLT) and cross-laminated timber (CLT), has been challenging researchers to provide adequate guidelines for the design and assessment of structures built in seismic regions. Some guidelines and analysis methods considered in seismic design can improve robustness, commonly described as the ability of structures to sustain limited damage without disproportionate effects. This paper proposes a probabilistic methodology for seismic and robustness assessment of timber-framed structures. The seismic performance and the progressive collapse potential of a three-storey building are here exemplified through the proposed methodology, which accounts for uncertainties in mechanical properties of members and connections, as well as for external loads. The Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) was used in each assessment to generate a set of 1000 structural models. Each structural model corresponds to a realization of the random variables used to define the structural model. Incremental dynamic analyses were performed to develop seismic fragility curves for different damage levels. The fragility functions for robustness assessment were developed for distinct damage scenarios, exploiting the results of an alternate load path analysis (ALPA) that involved the performance of nonlinear static analyses (pushdown analyses). The methodology presented is suitable for risk-based assessments that consider the occurrence of different exposures, such as earthquakes, impacts, and explosions, while considering the direct and indirect consequences of failures. However, the methodology involves time-consuming analyses with distinct load scenarios, which can constitute a burdening task within a typical building design phase. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Application of Fragility Analysis to Timber-Framed Structures for Seismic and Robustness Assessments,2021,Robustness assessment; Seismic assessment; Timber structures,Architectural design; Damage detection; Laminating; Office buildings; Product design; Regression analysis; Robustness (control systems); Seismology; Structural analysis; Structural frames; Timber; Wooden buildings; Glued-laminated timber; Incremental dynamic analysis; Latin hypercube sampling; Non-linear static analysis; Probabilistic methodology; Risk-based assessments; Seismic fragility curves; Time consuming analysis; Seismic design,1,1
12612,"This article deals with the application of an analytical methodology for the large-scale vulnerability assessment of reinforced concrete frame buildings in Italy. This methodology is known in the technical literature with the acronym SP-BELA (Simplified Pushover-Based Earthquake Loss Assessment) and has been adopted by the Eucentre research group to contribute to the production of the seismic risk maps in Italy, published in the National Risk Assessment document. The Italian maps were elaborated using the IRMA platform (Italian Risk MAps), which is a web platform developed by Eucentre. The IRMA platform is only addressed to the scientific community who can use it to share data, methods, and models for the evaluation of the seismic risk in Italy (Borzi et al. in Piattaforma IRMA Italian Risk MAps, 2018; Dolce et al. in Mappe di rischio per il territorio Italiano, 2019a; Faravelli et al. in Italian platform for seismic risk and damage scenario evaluation, 2019a, Borzi et al. in Bull Earthq Eng, 2020, Dolce et al. Bull Earthq Eng, 2020). SP-BELA defines the non-linear behaviour of a random population of buildings through a simplified pushover and a displacement-based procedure. Specifically, displacement capacity limits are identified on the pushover curve and then they are compared with the displacement demand from a response spectrum of each building in the random population. In this way, it is possible to define the probability of exceedance of the damage limits and hence generate the fragility curves. Then, the resulting curves have been calibrated by comparing the damage data observed on the reinforced concrete buildings with the damage analytically calculated with SP-BELA for the earthquakes of Molise 2002 and L’Aquila 2009. The final curves have been uploaded into the IRMA platform and used to produce damage maps for the entire national territory. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Application of the SP-BELA methodology to RC residential buildings in Italy to produce seismic risk maps for the national risk assessment,2021,Analytical method; Fragility curves; RC buildings; Seismic risk; Seismic vulnerability,Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Data Sharing; Earthquakes; Maps; Reinforced concrete; Risk perception; Analytical methodology; Displacement capacity; Nonlinear behaviours; Probability of exceedance; Reinforced concrete frame buildings; Residential building; Scientific community; Vulnerability assessments; Risk assessment; building; displacement; earthquake event; methodology; reinforced concrete; risk assessment; vulnerability; Italy; Aquila,1,1
12615,"Flood risk modelling aims to quantify the probability of flooding and the resulting consequences for exposed elements. The assessment of flood damage is a core task that requires the description of complex flood damage processes including the influences of flooding intensity and vulnerability characteristics. Multi-variable modelling approaches are better suited for this purpose than simple stage-damage functions. However, multi-variable flood vulnerability models require detailed input data and often have problems in predicting damage for regions other than those for which they have been developed. A transfer of vulnerability models usually results in a drop of model predictive performance. Here we investigate the questions as to whether data from the open-data source OpenStreetMap is suitable to model flood vulnerability of residential buildings and whether the underlying standardized data model is helpful for transferring models across regions. We develop a new data set by calculating numerical spatial measures for residential-building footprints and combining these variables with an empirical data set of observed flood damage. From this data set random forest regression models are learned using regional subsets and are tested for predicting flood damage in other regions. This regional split-sample validation approach reveals that the predictive performance of models based on OpenStreetMap building geometry data is comparable to alternative multi-variable models, which use comprehensive and detailed information about preparedness, socio-economic status and other aspects of residential-building vulnerability. The transfer of these models for application in other regions should include a test of model performance using independent local flood data. Including numerical spatial measures based on OpenStreetMap building footprints reduces model prediction errors (MAE - mean absolute error - by 20% and MSE - mean squared error - by 25 %) and increases the reliability of model predictions by a factor of 1.4 in terms of the hit rate when compared to a model that uses only water depth as a predictor. This applies also when the models are transferred to other regions which have not been used for model learning. Further, our results show that using numerical spatial measures derived from OpenStreetMap building footprints does not resolve all problems of model transfer. Still, we conclude that these variables are useful proxies for flood vulnerability modelling because these data are consistent (i.e. input variables and underlying data model have the same definition, format, units, etc.) and openly accessible and thus make it easier and more cost-effective to transfer vulnerability models to other regions.",Are OpenStreetMap building data useful for flood vulnerability modelling?,2021,None,JUNE 2013; AFFECTED RESIDENTS; NATURAL HAZARDS; RISK-ASSESSMENT; DAMAGE MODELS; EXTREME FLOOD; EXPOSURE; GERMANY; TRANSFERABILITY; PREPAREDNESS,1,1
12636,"Designer engineers have always the serious challenge regarding the choice of the kind of structures to use in the areas with significant seismic activities. Development of fragility curve provides an opportunity for designers to select a structure that will have the least fragility. This paper presents an investigation into the seismic vulnerability of both steel and reinforced concrete (RC) moment frames using fragility curves obtained by HAZUS and statistical methodologies. Fragility curves are employed for several probability parameters. Fragility curves are used to assess several probability parameters. Furthermore, it examines whether the probability of the exceedence of the damage limit state is reduced as expected. Nonlinear dynamic analyses of five-, eight-, and twelve-story frames are carried out using Perform 3D. The definition of damage states is based on the descriptions provided by HAZUS, which gives the limit states and the associated interstory drift limits for structures. The fragility curves show that the HAZUS procedure reduces probability of damage, and this reduction is higher for RC frames. Generally, the RC frames have higher fragility compared to steel frames. © 2017 Iman Mansouri et al.",Assessment of Seismic Vulnerability of Steel and RC Moment Buildings Using HAZUS and Statistical Methodologies,2017,None,None,1,1
12645,"Empirical tsunami fragility curves are developed based on a Bayesian framework by accounting for uncertainty of input tsunami hazard data in a systematic and comprehensive manner. Three fragility modeling approaches, i.e. lognormal method, binomial logistic method, and multinomial logistic method, are considered, and are applied to extensive tsunami damage data for the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. A unique aspect of this study is that uncertainty of tsunami inundation data (i.e. input hazard data in fragility modeling) is quantified by comparing two tsunami inundation/run-up datasets (one by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transportation of the Japanese Government and the other by the Tohoku Tsunami Joint Survey group) and is then propagated through Bayesian statistical methods to assess the effects on the tsunami fragility models. The systematic implementation of the data and methods facilitates the quantitative comparison of tsunami fragility models under different assumptions. Such comparison shows that the binomial logistic method with un-binned data is preferred among the considered models; nevertheless, further investigations related to multinomial logistic regression with un-binned data are required. Finally, the developed tsunami fragility functions are integrated with building damage-loss models to investigate the influences of different tsunami fragility curves on tsunami loss estimation. Numerical results indicate that the uncertainty of input tsunami data is not negligible (coefficient of variation of 0.25) and that neglecting the input data uncertainty leads to overestimation of the model uncertainty. © 2016, The Author(s).",Bayesian tsunami fragility modeling considering input data uncertainty,2017,2011 Tohoku earthquake; Bayesian regression; Logistic regression; Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation; Multinomial regression; Tsunami fragility,Earthquakes; Floods; Geophysics; Hazards; Input output programs; Intelligent systems; Markov processes; Monte Carlo methods; Regression analysis; Uncertainty analysis; 2011 tohoku earthquakes; Bayesian regression; Logistic regressions; Markov chain monte carlo simulation; Multinomials; Tsunamis; Bayesian analysis; computer simulation; Markov chain; modeling; Monte Carlo analysis; regression analysis; Tohoku earthquake 2011; tsunami; uncertainty analysis,1,1
12666,"A combination of a deterministic approach and fragility analysis is applied to assess tsunami damage caused to buildings. The area selected to validate the model is Imwon Port in Korea. The deterministic approach includes numerical modeling of tsunami propagation in the East Sea following an earthquake on the western coast of Japan. The model is based on the linear shallow-water equations (LSWE) augmented with Boussinesq approximation to account for dispersion effects in wave propagation, and coastal wave run-up is modeled by non-linear shallow-water equations (NLSWE). The output from the deterministic model comprises inundation depth. The numerical output is used to perform fragility analysis for buildings vulnerable to flooding by tsunamis in the port area. Recently developed fragility curves-based on the ordinal regression method-are used for damage probability estimates. The extent of structural damage in the areas under a tsunami hazard is identified by the numerical modeling of tsunami features. Our numerical model offers high bathymetric resolution, which enables us to capture flow features at the individual structure level and results in improved estimation of damage probability. This approach can serve as a measure of assessing structure vulnerability for areas with little or no records of tsunami damage and provide planners with a better understanding of structure behavior when a tsunami strikes. © 2016 by the authors.",Building damage assessment using scenario based tsunami numerical analysis and fragility curves,2016,Floods; Fragility analysis; Inundation depths; Structures; Tsunami hazard; Tsunami modeling,Damage detection; Equations of motion; Floods; Hazards; Regression analysis; Structural analysis; Structure (composition); Tsunamis; Wave propagation; Boussinesq approximations; Deterministic approach; Fragility analysis; Inundation depths; Linear shallow water equations; Non-linear shallow water equations; Tsunami hazards; Tsunami models; Numerical models; Boussinesq equation; building; earthquake event; flood damage; flooding; hazard assessment; numerical model; probability; shallow-water equation; tsunami; vulnerability; wave dispersion; wave propagation; Imwon; Kangwon; Korea; Pacific Ocean; Sea of Japan; South Korea,1,1
12675,"Recently proposed capacity-based damage indices and parametric models for capacity curves are applied to frame steel buildings located in soft soils of the Mexico City. To do that, the seismic performance of 2D models of low-, mid- and high-rise buildings is assessed. Deterministic and probabilistic nonlinear static and incremental dynamic analyses are implemented. Monte Carlo simulations and the Latin Hypercube sampling technique are used. Seismic actions are selected among accelerograms recorded in the study area. Spectral matching techniques are applied, so that the acceleration time histories have a predefined mean response spectrum and controlled error. The design spectrum of the Mexican seismic code for the zone is used as target spectrum. The well-known Park and Ang damage index allows calibrating the capacity-based damage index. Both damage indices take into account the contribution to damage of the stiffness degradation and of the energy dissipation. Damage states and fragility curves are also obtained and discussed in detail. The results reveal the versatility, robustness and reliability of the parametric model for capacity curves, which allow modelling the nonlinear part of the capacity curves by the cumulative integral of a cumulative lognormal function. However, these new capacity-based damage index and capacity models have been tested for and applied to 2D frame buildings only; they have not been applied to 3D building models yet. The Park and Ang and the capacity-based damage indices show that for the analysed buildings, the contribution to damage of the stiffness degradation is in the range 66-77% and that of energy loss is in the range 29-34%. The lowest contribution of energy dissipation (29%) is found for the low-rise, more rigid, building. The energy contribution would raise with the ductility of the building and with the duration of the strong ground motion. High-rise frame buildings in soft soils of Mexico City show the worst performance so that the use of adequate braced frames to control the displacements could be recommended.","Capacity, damage and fragility models for steel buildings: a probabilistic approach",2018,Non-linear structural analysis; Parametric model; Monte Carlo simulation; Steel buildings; Damage assessment,SEISMIC RISK; INDEX; PERFORMANCE; STRENGTH; VULNERABILITY; PUSHOVER; BEHAVIOR; DESIGN,1,1
12681,"Risk management programs and catastrophe models use fragility and vulnerability curves extensively. For the case of coastal flood events, the independent variable for these damage functions is usually the inundation depth, sometimes combined with some expression of water velocity or wave action. Postdisaster surveys often provide the basis for these damage functions, where the investigators classify the observed damage into broad categories based on qualitative descriptions. This paper describes a method to transform these qualitative evaluations into quantitative descriptions of damage states, which are then applied to develop fragility and vulnerability curves. The authors present this process within the context of the development of coastal flood fragility and vulnerability functions for the Florida Public Hurricane Loss Model. The model characterizes and quantifies the damage states specific to a set of fragility curves by using damage distributions and component cost analysis and transforms the fragility curves into a vulnerability curve. The paper analyzes the uncertainties in the model due to the number and quantification of the damage states and an adjustment function included in the discretization process. The analysis shows that the number of damage states governs the overall uncertainty.

12686,"The objective of this study was to determine the collapse risk of fail-safe reinforced concrete (RC) frames due to earthquakes by newly developed fragility curves. The curves were constructed based on the collapse mechanism, instead of measures of lateral drift as customarily adopted. The procedure was applied to RC open frames that were seismic resistant. A fail-safe mechanism was imposed by allowing plastic hinges to be formed mainly in the beams. This automatically satisfied the stronger column-weaker beam requirement; shear failure was neither tolerated anywhere in the columns nor in the beams. Two kinds of fail-safe RC frames were investigated: Special moment resisting frames (SMF) and ordinary moment resisting frames (OMF). Their earthquake collapse risk was computed and compared. Inelastic time history (NLTH) and the non-linear static procedure (NSP) were conducted to assess their structural performance. The results showed among others that the fail-safe OMF had lower collapse risk than the fail-safe SMF. The collapse prevention performance level in NLTH could only be achieved for the fail-safe frames. The non-linear time history analysis should be the only method used for seismic reevaluation/safety checking of building frame structures. © 2019 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.",Collapse risks of fail-safe rc frames due to earthquakes: Fragility assessments,2019,Collapse risk; Earthquake; Fail-safe reinforced concrete frame; Fragility; NSP; Time history,Earthquake engineering; Earthquakes; Steel beams and girders; Structural analysis; Structural frames; Collapse prevention; Collapse risks; Fail-safe mechanism; Fragility; Fragility assessment; Reinforced concrete frames; Special moment-resisting frames; Structural performance; Reinforced concrete,1,1
12691,"The use of different approaches in the development of flood damage models in various countries is expected to affect flood damage modelling at a regional or global scale. Since these models are often used as tools for disaster management and decision making, it is very needful to understand the comparative similarity and differences in countries’ loss models; this can help in the overall integration for developing regional risk models and cross-country risk assessment. In this study, empirically generated generalised loss models in three Asian countries (Sri Lanka, Thailand and Japan) were compared and applied to estimate potential flood damages in two different urban river basins. For each case study, each model was normalised using cost prices and floor areas (as applied to each country) and were integrated within the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to estimate damages for the flood events. Using the mean vulnerability index of corresponding building types for the selected countries, a single model for regional flood risk assessment was created. However, the study showed that there are variations in the vulnerability and the potential flood damage estimates of similar global building types from the three countries, despite being developed by the same approach. These are attributed to the country’s specific conditions such as building regulations and codes, GDP per capita, cost price of building materials. Our results suggest that the average vulnerability index from the countries however reduced potential errors in the estimates. Moreover, it is proposed that the average regional vulnerability model derived with empirical data inputs from all the countries for regional risk assessment and cross-country comparison. Therefore, it can predict near accurate potential flood damages, which can serve as measures for regional flood disaster risk management plans. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Comparative analyses of flood damage models in three Asian countries: towards a regional flood risk modelling,2019,Flood damage; GIS; Risk; Vulnerability,comparative study; decision making; disaster management; environmental risk; flood; flood damage; GIS; Gross Domestic Product; modeling; risk assessment; river basin; vulnerability; Japan; Sri Lanka; Thailand,1,1

Specifically, as regards the seismic risk assessment, six research units belonging to two centres of competence of the DPC collaborated under its guidance to update the risk maps of the Italian residential heritage. This extensive collaboration complied with the recent Italian code for Civil Protection, which requires a broad scientific consensus for risk assessment. During this research activity, six fragility models were developed, according to some common criteria (four for masonry buildings and two for RC buildings). These models were then implemented by the DPC for the definition of the national seismic risk. Within this context, the aim of this paper is to evaluate the risk results provided by these models, compare their features, and assess and validate their prediction capabilities. In particular, this paper shows the comparison of predicted and observed damage scenarios and consequences on building stock and the population of two seismic events, i.e. L’Aquila 2009 and Amatrice 2016. Furthermore, the paper provides some interesting damage and risk predictions at a national level.

12745,"Large reserves of unexploited shale gas in Brazil have recently been reported, some of them located near densely populated cities. Obviously, the possibility for commercial exploitation of these resources has suddenly arisen, although such activities have been found to be correlated with the occurrence of induced earthquakes in other parts of the word. As in many other countries, in Brazil, making provision for the eventual effects of induced seismicity was not a consideration when the seismic standards were developed. Today, we do know about the possibility of induced earthquakes occurring, but the knowledge about the potential extent of the resulting damages remains imperfect, at best. Consequently, studies such as the one presented here, and another recently completed, are a first step to improve the knowledge base of the potential risk of induced earthquakes in Brazil for devising adequate risk-control mechanisms. This study assesses the probabilistic response to induced earthquakes of prevalent low-rise engineered reinforced concrete buildings in Brazil. Fragility functions are developed, considering structural and non-structural damage, and including the structural contribution of masonry infills. It was found that, when infill walls do not work as structural components, structural damage is more likely to occur, and conversely, when they do, non-structural damage is significant. The latter effect is produced by the reduction of the natural period of vibration, which exacerbates damage on interior components sensitive to floor acceleration.

12748,"This paper presents fragility curves for conventional low-rise light-frame wood buildings in southwestern British Columbia, Canada, for long duration subduction earthquakes. Computational models of four representative two-story houses (two engineered and two non-engineered) are developed and validated using full-scale shake table testing data. Damage states are evaluated using the Park and Ang damage index. Incremental dynamic analyses are employed for calibrating and assessing the index. Duration effects are investigated by using 30 long duration subduction motions and 30 “spectrally equivalent” short duration crustal motions. The results indicate that the considered houses are more vulnerable to damage under subduction motions which increase the median damage indices of both individual shearwalls and entire lateral systems for all four houses at the same level of ground shaking. The correlation between system damage indices with ground motion duration was dependent on the level of ground shaking and the seismic resistance of the systems. The results further demonstrate that exterior stucco finish greatly reduces the seismic damage and can be used as an effective seismic retrofit strategy for conventional non-engineered wood construction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Damage index fragility assessment of low-rise light-frame wood buildings under long duration subduction earthquakes,2020,Fragility curve; Ground motion duration; Incremental dynamic analyses; Structural damage; Subduction earthquake,Building materials; Earthquake effects; Earthquake engineering; Houses; Structural analysis; Wooden buildings; Wooden construction; Fragility curves; Ground motions; Incremental dynamic analysis; Structural damages; Subduction earthquakes; Damage detection,1,1
12753,"The Northeast region of India is considered to be the most seismically active zone in India, having witnessed two major earthquakes (Mw &gt; 8) in the past. Recently, the 2017 Ambasa earthquake (with Mw of 5.7) caused significant damage to unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings in Tripura, a Northeast state of India. The typical nature of damage observed in URM buildings during the post-earthquake damage survey highlights poor construction practices that have been used in this region even though the seismic hazard of the Northeast region of India is well established. In this context, the present study is an effort to evaluate through fragility analysis the vulnerability of existing low-rise URM buildings in Agartala, the capital city of Tripura, which in a broader sense represents the buildings of the entire Northeast region of India, through fragility analysis. In this regard, an assessment method based on a nonlinear static approach is used to develop bilinear capacity curve parameters. The capacity curve parameters are then used to estimate fragility functions. Fragility analysis shows that URM buildings would suffer heavy damage even for an earthquake having Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) of 0.18 g, which is used to design buildings in the Northeast region of India according to the Indian seismic code. Fragility curves developed in this study may prove useful for assessing the seismic risk of the same building typology in other urban areas of Northeast India.

12758,"The aim of this work is to open up new opportunities for designers towards a performance-based approach to derive fragilities at design stage. Nonlinear Time-History Analysis (NTHA) represents the current practice for the estimation of damage within the Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering (PBEE) framework. Among the NTHA approaches for fragility assessment, Cloud Analysis (CA) represents a convenient tool which allows evaluating the parameters of the conditional demand distribution based on simple regression of cloud-dispersed data points obtained from recorded ground motions. Notwithstanding the growth in computer processing power and software development, NTHA is generally time-consuming and it requires advanced expertise in nonlinear modelling, preventing its use in the professional field at design stage. Herein, a novel procedure for deriving fragility curves built up through Linear Time-History Analysis (LTHA) and CA is presented. It can be employed within a simplified PBEE approach at design stage for performance comparison of design solutions. Differences between LTHA results and those obtained through NTHA are compared for the assessment of a 12-storey Reinforced-Concrete Moment-Resisting-Frame building designed according to Eurocode 8. Assessment is performed for two limit states: Life Safety- and Damage Limitation- Limit State. Critical aspects for LTHA-based fragility assessment such as (i) influence of ground motion suite size and (ii) identification of “unacceptable cases” are investigated. The final level of approximation of these “design-fragilities” is very satisfactory making the full approach pursuable and useful for professional applications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Derivation of fragility curves at design stage through linear time-history analysis,2020,Cloud analysis; Eurocode 8; Fragility curves; Ground motion selection; Time-history analysis; Unacceptable cases,Damage detection; Earthquake engineering; Reinforced concrete; Computer processing power; Fragility assessment; Moment resisting frames; Non-linear modelling; Nonlinear time history analysis; Performance based approach; Performance comparison; Performance-based earthquake engineering; Software design; concrete structure; earthquake damage; earthquake engineering; ground motion; linearity; multistorey building; performance assessment; regression analysis; reinforced concrete; seismic design,1,1
12761,"The development of fragility curves to perform seismic scenario-based risk assessment requires a fully probabilistic procedure in order to account for uncertainties at each step of the computation. This is especially true when developing fragility curves conditional on an Intensity Measure that is directly available from a ground-motion prediction equation. In this study, we propose a new derivation method that uses realistic spectra instead of design spectral shapes or uniform hazard spectra and allows one to easily account for the features of the site-specific hazard that influences the fragility, without using non-linear dynamic analysis. The proposed method has been applied to typical school building types in the city of Basel (Switzerland) and the results have been compared to the standard practice in Europe. The results confirm that fragility curves are scenario dependent and are particularly sensitive to the magnitude of the earthquake scenario. The same background theory used for the derivation of the fragility curves has allowed an innovative method to be proposed for the conversion of fragility curves to a common IM (i.e. spectral acceleration or PGA). This conversion is the only way direct comparisons of fragility curves can be made and is useful when inter-period correlation cannot be used in scenario loss assessment. Moreover, such conversion is necessary to compare and verify newly developed curves against those from previous studies. Conversion to macroseismic intensity is also relevant for the comparison between mechanical-based and empirical fragility curves, in order to detect possible biases. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Deriving fragility functions from bilinearized capacity curves for earthquake scenario modelling using the conditional spectrum,2018,Conditional spectrum; Fragility curves; Inter-period correlation; Mechanical method; Uncertainties; Vulnerability assessment,Computation theory; Equations of motion; Hazards; Motion estimation; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Conditional spectrums; Fragility curves; Mechanical methods; Uncertainties; Vulnerability assessments; Earthquakes; bearing capacity; correlation; earthquake; modeling; risk assessment; scenario analysis; statistical analysis; uncertainty analysis; vulnerability; Basel; Basel-Stadt; Europe; Switzerland,1,1
12767,"Several evaluation methods of the seismic vulnerability have been developed around the world. Which are very use ful from humanitarian and socioeconomic point of view. Generally these methods use knowledge obtained from previous earthquakes and they are basing on seismic intensity scales and on buildings direct observation. But the macroseismic intensity expresses the consequences of the seism, and not its physical characteristics of the structures. Contrary to this type of methods, an approach based on a nonlinear analysis (Push-Over method) is proposed in this work. It consists in modeling the excitation of the earthquake by a response spectrum and building's behavior by capacity curves. These capacity curves are obtained from numerical modeling performed by Opensees software. The superposition of the two curves, response spectra and capacity curve, makes it possible to determine the performance point and consequently to deduce the state of expected damage. To estimate the probability of damage of a building at a given level of solicitation (defined by Sd), we excites a group of buildings characterized by different parameters related to the geometry of the building and those are related to the materials used (concrete, steel) by seismic solicitation (Response spectrum - RPA 99). The performance point for each building is determined by a procedure defined in FEMA 440. We classifies the buildings according to the position of performance point on their curve which defines a damage state of ds (Mild, Moderate, Important or Ruin) according to the damage levels of Risk-UE. A statistical analysis is then made for each class to build the fragility curves. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.",Developed approach to determine the seismic vulnerability of reinforced concrete structures,2018,None,Buildings; Concretes; Geophysics; Nonlinear analysis; Reinforced concrete; Seismology; Stability; Direct observations; Evaluation methods; Macroseismic intensity; Performance points; Physical characteristics; Probability of damages; Seismic intensity; Seismic vulnerability; Earthquakes,1,1
12775,"Iran is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. In recent earthquakes, the low quality of constructions has caused huge losses, both in human and economic terms. The high level of seismic hazard in combination with a high physical vulnerability of structures leads to a high earthquake risk of Iran, which has to be managed in some ways. Earthquake happening in populated areas causing economic and human losses has shown the vital role of assessing buildings' vulnerabilities as well as loss estimations. Vulnerability curve is one of the essential instruments to evaluate structural losses before the events. Regarding the lack of categorized vulnerability curves for Iranian buildings, this study focuses on filling this critical gap. For this reason, empirical approach involving statistical processing on existing data from the previous studies is used to develop vulnerability curves for Iranian buildings by critiquing the existing fragility/vulnerability curves in Iran and other countries. The logic-tree method is used to combine these curves by weighting in accordance with the condition of construction provisions, seismic code and engineering judgment. Finally, vulnerability curves are developed for the 42 Iranian building types. Results are presented by median (Sa) and lognormal standard deviation (β S a) values for all types of selected buildings and related uncertainties are considered as well. © 2015 Institution of Mechanical Engineers.",Developing seismic vulnerability curves for typical Iranian buildings,2015,earthquake risk; fragility curve; Iran; logic-tree method; Seismic vulnerability curve; structural loss,Buildings; Data handling; Geophysics; Seismology; Earthquake risk; Fragility curves; Iran; Logic tree; Seismic vulnerability curves; Structural loss; Earthquakes,1,1
12777,"The last earthquake that affected the city of Coquimbo took place in September 2015 and had a magnitude of M-w = 8.3, resulting in localized damage in low-lying areas of the city. In addition, another seismic gap north of the 2015 earthquake rupture area has been identified; therefore, a significant earthquake (M-w = 8.2 to 8.5) and tsunami could occur in the near future. The present paper develops a tsunami fragility curve for the city of Coquimbo based on field survey data and tsunami numerical simulations. The inundation depth of the 2015 Chile tsunami in Coquimbo was estimated by means of numerical simulation with the Non-hydrostatic Evolution of Ocean WAVEs (NEOWAVE) model and five nested grids with a maximum grid resolution of 10 m. The fragility curve exhibited behavior similar to that of other curves in flat areas in Japan, where little damage was observed at relatively high inundation depths. In addition, it was observed that Coquimbo experienced less damage than Dichato (Chile); in fact, at an inundation depth of 2 m, Dichato had a similar to 75% probability of damage, while Coquimbo proved to have only a 20% probability. The new fragility curve was used to estimate the damage by possible future tsunamis in the area. The damage assessment showed that similar to 50% of the structures in the low-lying area of Coquimbo have a high probability of damage in the case of a tsunami generated off the coast of the study area if the city is rebuilt with the same types of structures.","Development and application of a tsunami fragility curve of the 2015 tsunami in Coquimbo, Chile",2018,None,W 8.3 ILLAPEL; INDIAN-OCEAN; HAZARD ASSESSMENT; INUNDATION DEPTH; SUBDUCTION ZONE; BUILDING DAMAGE; RUPTURE PROCESS; MOMENTUM FLUX; SOURCE MODELS; EARTHQUAKE,1,1
12781,"A simplified analytical method for the seismic fragility assessment of Reinforced Concrete buildings at large scale is presented. The proposed method is based on a simulated design procedure to define the structural model and on non-linear static analysis of a simplified structural model based on Shear-Type assumption to evaluate seismic capacity. Damage States are defined according to the observational-based Damage States provided by the European Macroseismic Scale (EMS-98). Presence of infills is considered, both taking into account their influence on the structural response and evaluating the damage to such non-structural elements. The method is applied to the Reinforced Concrete building stock data provided by the field survey carried out on a city in a high seismic area in Southern Italy, which are illustrated and compared with data from other sources. Uncertainties in seismic demand, material characteristics, and capacity models are taken into account through a Monte Carlo simulation technique. Fragility curves are obtained for each building, leading to the evaluation of annual failure probability at the assumed Damage States. The influence of key parameters in predicting seismic fragility, such as the number of storeys and the age of construction, is illustrated. The spatial distribution of annual failure probability at the different Damage States provides information on areas most prone to seismic risk within the city, depending both on building stock characteristics and on local amplification of seismic hazard due to soil conditions. A comparison with empirical-based fragility curves from literature is also illustrated. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Development and urban-scale application of a simplified method for seismic fragility assessment of RC buildings,2015,Building stock data; Infills; Large scale; Reinforced Concrete buildings; Simplified seismic fragility assessment,Buildings; Concrete buildings; Concretes; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Probability distributions; Reinforced concrete; Seismic design; Seismology; Annual failure probability; Building stocks; Infills; Large scale; Monte carlo simulation technique; Non-linear static analysis; Seismic fragility; Simplified analytical methods; Structural design; building; earthquake damage; infill; reinforced concrete; seismic hazard; seismic response; urban area; Italy,1,1
12788,"Depth vs. damage curves were developed for a flood risk assessment carried out in Colombo, Sri Lanka. The major elements of the damage assessment comprised building fabrics, building contents, distributed infrastructure and vehicles. Current approaches to damage function development were improved on by separating damage to building fabric and contents; using actual building footprints rather than assigning building functions to city zones; assessing infrastructure damage accurately; and incorporating damage to vehicles. Information sources included infrastructure agencies, bills of quantities for buildings, expert consultations, household surveys and insurance agencies. The building fabric was assigned three categories, namely semi-permanent, single storey and two storey. The building contents were classified into 7 types based on function as warehouse/storage, industrial, shops, offices, residential, educational and health. The proportion of contents asset values to that of the fabric ranged from 1.67 for warehouse/storage to 0.20for educational. Both 'what-if' analyses and historic data were used to generate the curves. Data were obtained as losses per unit area or unit length; or as point losses.For the 140 square km urban area, the generated flood damages ranged from USD 37 to 549 million for return periods from 5 to 100 years, with average inundation depths ranging from 0.48 m to 1.28 m (and outliers up to 5.8 m). The total non-residential to residential building damage increased with return period (and together accounted for 75-85% of damage). The residential contents to fabric damage ratio was generally around 1.5. The percentage damage to infrastructure was not very significant, although that to vehicles was, especially at lower return periods. © 2018 The Authors.

12789,"The Thabeikkyin earthquake (moment magnitude scale of 6.8) occurred on November 11, 2012; its epicenter was located 25 km from Thabeikkyin Township, Mandalay Region, Myanmar. Many buildings were damaged severely during the earthquake. In this study, damage patterns of brick-nogging buildings were firstly developed, and damage grades were characterized to allow for easy classification of the damaged buildings. The damaged data of all building types in the surveyed areas were collected by classifying the four damage levels as no damage, slight damage, moderate damage, and heavy damage. To develop the damage patterns of brick-nogging buildings, damage categories were arranged into three damage grades (slight, moderate, and heavy damage). Secondly, a questionnaire survey was conducted to calculate the seismic intensities of the affected areas. Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik (MSK) seismic intensities for the surveyed areas were estimated by analyzing the questionnaire survey responses. Finally, fragility curves for brick-nogging buildings were constructed using the estimated seismic intensities from the survey responses combined with the damage levels. These fragility curves may be useful to assess damage to brick-nogging buildings and to predict the number of damaged buildings in future earthquakes. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Development of Damage Patterns and Fragility Curves in Brick-nogging Buildings from the Thabeikkyin Earthquake, Myanmar, 2012",2018,2012 Thabeikkyin Earthquake; Brick-Nogging Building; Damage Pattern; Fragility Curve; MSK Seismic Intensity; Questionnaire Survey,Brick; Buildings; Phase shift keying; Surveys; Brick nogging; Damage Pattern; Fragility curves; Questionnaire surveys; Seismic intensity; Earthquakes,1,1
12791,"As a function of fragility curves in earthquake engineering, the assessment of the probability of exceeding a specific damage state according to the magnitude of earthquake can be considered. Considering that the damage states for fragility curves are generally nested to each other, the possibility theory, a special form of the evidence theory for nested intervals, is applied to generate fragility information from seismic damage data. While the lognormal distributions are conventionally used to generate fragility curves due to their simplicity and applicability, the methodology to use the possibility theory does not require the assumption of distributions. Seismic damage data classified by four damage levels were used for a case study. The resulted possibility-based fragility information expressed by two monotone measures, possibility and certainty, are compared with the conventional fragility curves based on probability. The results showed that the conventional fragility curves provide a conservative estimation at the relatively high earthquake magnitude compared with the possibility-based fragility information.",Development of Empirical Fragility Curves in Earthquake Engineering considering Nonspecific Damage Information,2018,None,VULNERABILITY; BUILDINGS; UNCERTAINTIES; ASSESSMENTS,1,1
12795,"This study aims to develop the fragility curve of reinforced concrete buildings with different height based on dynamic analysis. There are 4 models of the moment-resisting concrete frame (MRCF) were used, which are 10, 15, 20, and 25-storey. Each of these frames was designed based on Eurocode 2. The SAP2000 program was used as the main analysis tool to obtain the limit state of MRCF. Then, an incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) was carried out with 7 ground motion records obtained from the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center (PEER). The IDA curves were compared with the limit state of the MRCF, which is maximum allowable drift. The calculation of maximum allowable drift is based on the formula from the International Building Code (IBC, 2003). From the IDA results, 10-storey MRCF has better structural performance under the same ground motion as compared to other MRCF (10, 15, 20, and 25-storey). Fragility curves were developed by considering the results of IDA as parameters. Based on the results of the fragility curve, the MRCF that has the highest probability of exceeding the limit state is 25-storey MRCF. This is because 25-storey MRCF has the lowest PGA at 100% probability. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Development of Fragility Curve of Reinforced Concrete Buildings with Different Height Based on Dynamic Analysis,2021,Drift limit; Fragility curve; Ground motions; Incremental dynamic analysis; Reinforced concrete,None,1,1

A database describing the geometric properties (walls density, building area, height) of this type of structure was developed using data from field surveys. This information was complemented with results from experimental tests to compute a large set of capacity curves using a mechanical procedure. These models were tested against a set of ground motion records using the displacement-based earthquake loss assessment (DBELA) procedure, and the structural responses were used to derive fragility functions for four building classes. The resulting fragility curves were convoluted with seismic hazard curves to evaluate the annualized expected loss ratio and annual collapse probability. © 2018, Earthquake Engineering Research Institute.","Development of fragility curves for confined masonry buildings in Lima, Peru",2018,None,Masonry materials; Collapse probabilities; Displacement-Based; Earthquake scenario; Experimental test; Fragility function; Geometric properties; Seismic fragility; Structural response; Earthquakes; building; database; field survey; ground motion; masonry; seismic hazard; seismic response; structural response; Lima [Peru]; Peru,1,1
12798,"The objective of this study is to develop analytical fragility curves for an ensemble of existing 3-to 6-story residential steel buildings with concentrically braced frames in 2 directions, designed during 2010 to 2015 in Qazvin, Iran. The buildings were modeled three-dimensionally in OpenSees considering braces buckling behavior. Maximum Inter-story Drift Ratio (.MIDR) and spectral acceleration at. fundamental period of the structure with 5% viscous damping (Sa(7\,5%)) were considered as Damage Index (DI) and Intensity Measure (/M), respectively. Limit states were specified as discussed in FEMA 356. Ground motion record selection and uncertainties assessment were carried out based on FEMA P695 methodology. Analysis was performed using truncated Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA). Fragility function was defined as a log-normal Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) and maximum likelihood method was used to estimate fragility parameters. According to the fragility curves obtained, seismic vulnerability of the structures generally increased as the number of stories rose. Concentration of the inelasticity was also found to be mainly at. the first, story level. The results also confirmed the fact that the record t o record variability is the main source of uncertainty in structural probabilistic evaluation. © 2019 Sharif University of Technology.

12802,"Risk models, which describe the relationship between hazard intensity and a damage ratio are Increasingly used in flood risk management. Direct tangible damage resulting from flooding is typically computed based on the internationally accepted method of depth-damage curves. Depth-damage curves relate absolute damage (in terms of currency) or relative loss (percentage of the estimated total replacement value of property) to a given flood depth. Many depth-damage functions in use today are computed from synthetic data, where data are collected from a representative sample of buildings with similar properties in a floodplain during field surveys. A primary problem when assessing risk at an object-based spatial resolution using depth-damage curves is that these damage functions represent an average structure in the study location. There Is great variability across any given structural class as well as variation within individual structures in a structural category (and across communities), for example, not all one-storey residences with basements are the same size, nor constructed of the same quality of materials and workmanship. The variability within a given class of buildings and the resulting depth-damage curve are often not transparent to the end user, thus damage estimates for individual buildings may be over/under estimated. In this paper, synthetic depth-damage curve data from communities in southern Ontario are used to develop probabilistic cost functions such that monetary damage estimates, as spent in Canadian dollars, and their likelihood of being exceeded at any given flood depth are more clearly expressed and communicated to end users. © 6th International Disaster Mitigation Specialty Conference 2018, Held as Part of the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering Annual Conference 2018.

12803,The present work is to study the effect of Brick Masonry Infill (BMI) in reinforced concrete (RC) building on seismic fragility curves using Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA). Multiple IDA curves which capture the ground motion uncertainties and which govern the shape of fragility curves are developed for twenty real ground motions. Spectral acceleration-based fragility curves and damage probability matrix under various damage states are developed for midrise RC frames with and without BMI. The comparative fragility curves for buildings with and without BMI are presented. It is concluded that the BMI frame have shown superior performance during earthquake in all modes of different damage states and the dispersion of Damage Measures (DM) and Intensity Measures (IM) in IDA analysis are less in the case of BMI thus improve robustness of the building response results in predictability in design.,Development of seismic fragility curves for mid-rise Masonry infilled reinforced concrete building by Incremental Dynamic Analysis,2017,Brick Masonry Infill; Equivalent strut; Fragility analysis; Incremental Dynamic Analysis; Lognormal distribution function; Nonlinear modeling,Brick; Concrete buildings; Concretes; Damage detection; Distribution functions; Dynamic analysis; Earthquake effects; Masonry materials; Seismology; Brick masonry; Equivalent struts; Fragility analysis; Incremental dynamic analysis; Log-normal distribution; Non-linear model; Reinforced concrete,1,1
12804,"Seismic vulnerability assessment of the old buildings assumes great importance, not only because of the obvious physical consequences in the eventual occurrence of a seismic event, but also because it is the aspect in which engineering research can intervene. Unfortunately, due to the lack of knowledge and uncertainties, which appear in case of old existing building in general, or in mixed masonry-reinforced concrete buildings in particular, the assessment of the seismic vulnerability is undoubtedly a challenging task. The object of this paper is to assess the seismic behaviour of mixed masonry-reinforced concrete building class through the nonlinear static sensitivity analyses by considering the uncertainty that reflects the inherent variability of the outcome of a repeatable experiment (aleatory uncertainty) and the seismic demand as provided by EC8. To the latter goal, results from these analyses are used to define the Intensity Measure (IM LS ) and dispersion (β LS ) to the final aim to obtain the fragility curves by quantitatively assessing the effect due to the variability of seismic demand and structural capacity. © 2018 The International Masonry Society (IMS).",Development of seismic fragility curves for mixed masonry-RC buildings in Lisbon,2018,Fragility curves; Mixed masonry-reinforced concrete buildings; Nonlinear static analysis; Seismic assessment; Sensitivity analysis,Concrete buildings; Reinforced concrete; Seismic response; Sensitivity analysis; Aleatory uncertainty; Fragility curves; Inherent variability; Non-linear static analysis; Seismic assessment; Seismic fragility curves; Seismic vulnerability; Structural capacities; Uncertainty analysis,1,1
12806,"Understanding the seismic vulnerability of building structures is important for seismic engineers, building owners, risk insurers and governments. Seismic vulnerability defines a buildings predisposition to be damaged as a result of an earthquake of a given severity. There are two components to seismic risk; the seismic hazard and the exposure of the structural inventory to any given earthquake event. This paper demonstrates the development of fragility curves at different damage states using a detailed mechanical model of a moment resisting reinforced concrete structure typical of Southern Europe. The mechanical model consists of a complex three-dimensional finite element model of the reinforced concrete moment resisting frame structure and is used to define the damage states through pushover analysis. Fragility curves are also defined using the HAZUS macro-seismic methodology and the Risk-UE macro-seismic methodology. Comparison of the mechanically modelled and HAZUS fragility curve shows good agreement while the Risk-UE methodology shows reasonably poor agreement. © McCrum et al.; License Bentham Open.",Development of seismic fragility functions for a moment resisting reinforced concrete framed structure,2016,Abaqus; FEM; Fragility functions; Reinforced concrete; Vulnerability,ABAQUS; Concretes; Finite element method; Geophysics; Reinforced concrete; Seismic design; Seismology; Structural frames; Building structure; Earthquake events; Fragility function; Moment resisting frames; Push-over analysis; Seismic vulnerability; Three dimensional finite element model; Vulnerability; Earthquakes,1,1
12867,"The estimation of flood losses is crucial for the quantitative estimation of risk and the cost–benefit analysis of risk mitigation and prevention measures. Flood losses are usually estimated by means of vulnerability functions, which are often developed in a synthetic way by experts, since loss datasets collected after events are sparse or lacking and mostly refer to slow riverine inundations. Simple univariable empirical vulnerability functions are recognized as a more valuable tool with respect to synthetic curves developed for different contexts. The aim of this work is to derive empirical vulnerability functions for a flash flood event which occurred in Livorno (Italy) in September 2017, based on the hydrologic–hydraulic reconstruction of the flood and observed losses to residential properties. The hydrologic processes are reproduced with a distributed hydrologic model, and the flood propagation is simulated with a full 2D model. Many open GIS data are used and combined with virtual on-site inspection in the study area to analyze building exposure. Different regression curves are tested to fit the data and obtain damage curves. The results show (i) a poor correlation between relative or absolute losses and flow velocity, (ii) a low correlation between relative losses and water depth, thus confirming the existing literature. More significant correlation is found between absolute losses and water depths. The curves here derived provide a first attempt to develop damage functions for flash flood in Italy, which could be applied in similar urban and morphologic contexts. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Empirical flash flood vulnerability functions for residential buildings,2020,Flash flood; Flood damage; Flood risk; Flood vulnerability; Stage–damage function,Cost benefit analysis; Flood damage; Flow velocity; Housing; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Distributed hydrologic model; Flood propagation; Hydraulic reconstruction; Hydrologic process; On-site inspection; Prevention measures; Quantitative estimation; Residential building; Risk perception,1,1
12870,"This paper illustrates the derivation of an empirical fragility model for residential unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings, calibrated on Italian post-earthquake damage data and compatible with the key features of the Italian national seismic risk platform.

To this aim, a clustering strategy is implemented to merge predefined building typologies into vulnerability classes, based on the similarity of the observed seismic fragility. On the other side, a specific procedure is built up to determine the vulnerability composition of the exposed URM building stock, starting from national census data. The empirically-derived model was implemented into the national seismic risk platform and used, together with other vulnerability models, for assessing seismic risk in Italy.

12873,"In this study, empirical fragility curves expressed in terms of relationship between damage ratio indices of buildings and ground motion indices were developed in northern Miyagi prefecture located in nearfield areas during the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake. The ground motion indices were evaluated from observed ground motions at strongmotion stations and estimated at sites at which no strong-motion accelerometers were deployed during the mainshock. The ground motions at the noninstrumental sites were estimated using the empirical Green’s function method based on bedrock motions inverted from observed records on surfaces from small events that occurred inside the source fault, transfer functions due to underground velocity structures identified from microtremor H/V spectral ratios, and a short-period source model of the mainshock. The findings indicated that the empirical fragility curves as functions of Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) instrumental seismic intensity during the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake almost corresponded to those during the 1995Kobe Earthquake and the seven disastrous earthquakes that occurred between 2003 and 2008. However, the empirical fragility curves as functions of peak ground velocity were the lowest. A possible reason for this is that the response spectra of the ground motions in the period ranging from 1.0 s to 1.5 s were small during the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake. Another reason could be the seismic resistant capacities of buildings in the studied districts involved during the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake exceeded those in the cities affected during the 1995 Kobe Earthquake. © 2016 Fuji Technology Press Ltd.

12874,"This study investigates the damage data after November 12, 2017, Iran earthquake (Mw 7.3), collected on 440 steel and reinforced concrete residential buildings. Structures have low-to-medium height and are located in Sarpol-e-zahab city, as well as in the west and northwest parts of Kermanshah province, Iran. The peak ground acceleration demands are determined according to data of the micro-shakemap of Sarpol-e-zahab city and the shakemap of Kermanshah province, while the mean values of intensities are determined from the existing empirical relationship between PGA and intensity. The investigated buildings are engineered steel and RC structures nominally erected according to the second and third editions of the Iranian code for earthquake-resistant buildings, but mostly under careless supervision and with low-quality materials. Damage probability matrix, vulnerability index and empirical fragility curves are presented for three subgroups of steel and RC structures on the basis of (i) structural materials and seismic resistant systems (i.e. braced, moment and combination of braced and moment steel frames, as well as moment and combination of moment and shear wall RC frames), without considering the height of structures; (ii) structural materials and height of structures, without considering the seismic resistant systems (i.e. low and medium-height steel and RC structures); (iii) structural materials, without considering the seismic resistant systems and height of structures (i.e. total data for steel and RC frames). The proposed fragility curves are compared with other fragility curves for steel and RC buildings from previous studies. Finally, since this earthquake was the first seismic event in Iran affecting a considerable number of steel and RC engineered buildings, the proposed empirical fragility curves are definitely unique and crucial for realistic damage and vulnerability assessment of similar buildings in future earthquake scenarios, as well as for developing rapid seismic loss assessment after damaging earthquakes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Empirical fragility curves of engineered steel and RC residential buildings after Mw 7.3 2017 Sarpol-e-zahab earthquake,2021,Fragility curves; Iranian building typology; Sarpol-e-zahab earthquake; Seismic vulnerability assessment; Steel and RC buildings,Damage detection; Earthquakes; Housing; Reinforced concrete; Damage probability matrices; Earthquake scenario; Earthquake-resistant buildings; Empirical relationships; Peak ground acceleration; Residential building; Vulnerability assessments; Vulnerability index; Earthquake engineering; earthquake; empirical analysis; reinforced concrete; residential location; steel; vulnerability; Iran; Kermanshah,1,1
12876,"The paper analyses the seismic fragility of precast reinforced concrete buildings using observational damage data gathered after the 2012 Emilia earthquakes that struck Northern Italy. The damage level in 1890 buildings was collected, classified and examined. Damage matrices were then evaluated, and finally, empirical fragility curves were fitted using Bayesian regression. Building damage was classified using a six-level scale derived from EMS-98.

12877,"Empirical seismic fragility curves have been developed based on post-seismic survey data on official building damage, collected in the epicentral area of Mw 6.1, 2014 Mae Lao earthquake. In total, about 26,551 survey building data have been investigated by authorities and engineers. The typical pattern of observed damage for different structures and the reasons for damage are presented. In addition, damage statistics in the field are correlated with ground motion in order to derive empirical seismic fragility curves. Using a maximum likelihood method, different sets of fragility curves are developed to demonstrate the influence of structural material on building damage level. The good correlation between observed damage and peak ground acceleration (PGA) are observed. In addition, the results show a better seismic performance of the engineered reinforced concrete building over non-engineered buildings. These findings are essential to support a better future building damage assessments, land use management, and seismic risk mitigation planning. © 2019 The Authors",Empirical seismic fragility functions based on field survey data after the 5 May 2014 Mae Lao (Northern Thailand) earthquake,2020,2014 Mae Lao earthquake; Non-engineered building; Seismic fragility curve; Thailand,None,1,1
12878,"School facilities in Iran, in particular masonry schools, have shown poor performance during past earthquakes and can be identified as one of the parts of the country’s infrastructure that is most vulnerable to earthquakes. Hence, in this paper a method to perform index-based damage assessment for brick masonry schools located in the province of Yazd, the central region of Iran, using a comprehensive database of school buildings, is proposed. The database was obtained from the field survey forms applied for each observed school to collect the features of and damage to the structure. The results of a vulnerability index method developed in Iran are employed as input data to obtain empirical fragility curves for the school inventory. The Macroseismic model and GNDT II level method are two empirical methods combined in this procedure. Finally, the procedure is verified using damage survey data obtained after recent earthquakes (1990 Manjil–Rudbar earthquake and 2003 Bam earthquake) that occurred in Iran. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Empirical seismic vulnerability analysis for masonry buildings based on school buildings survey in Iran,2016,Damage factor; Fragility curves; Iran; Masonry schools; Vulnerability assessment; Vulnerability index,Developing countries; Earthquakes; Geophysics; Masonry materials; School buildings; Societies and institutions; Surveys; Damage factor; Fragility curves; Iran; Masonry schools; Vulnerability assessments; Vulnerability index; Damage detection; Bam earthquake 2003; damage; empirical analysis; field survey; hazard assessment; index method; masonry; numerical model; seismic method; vulnerability; Iran; Yazd,1,1
12882,"Following a series of deadly tornadoes between 2011 and 2013, this paper develops a numerical tool to help communities better predict and quantify the potential tornado damage to single-family residential structures from a tornado strike. The objective is to determine the predictive capability of an engineering-based tornado damage-assessment (ETDA) Tool using published building damage observations captured by the authors in a recent tornado. The research is motivated by the need for the public to visualize the extent of tornado vulnerabilities of residential buildings in our communities. The research developed a numerical estimation model to aggregate damage that a specified tornado would cause to the residential wood-framed structures in a community. The ETDA Tool was developed around a Monte Carlo simulation engine, using theoretical models for tornado wind velocity and pressure drop in the tornado vortex, as well as experimentally-determined probability distribution functions for the structural resistances of eight building component systems selected to describe the structure. The output of the EDTA Tool is presented as series of mean damage ratios, and other statistics quantifying tornado-damage caused, plotted against distance away from the tornado vortex centerline. The paper explains the methodology of the approach and presents results comparing hindcast damage ratios against observed values of field-observations collected after a tornado strike on residential communities in Garland/Rowlett, TX. It was found the ETDA Tool provides reasonable agreement with the field damage observations to houses. The Tool could be used by a community to model any tornado path and/or size and estimate future damage. More research to further our understanding of tornado-induced wind loads and wind-borne debris effects is needed to increase confidence in its application to any tornado and any city. © Copyright © 2020 Jain, Bhusar, Roueche and Prevatt.",Engineering-Based Tornado Damage Assessment: Numerical Tool for Assessing Tornado Vulnerability of Residential Structures,2020,damage; Monte - Carlo simulation; residential; structural load paths; tornado; wind engineering; wind load,None,1,1
12905,"The Tehran metropolitan area is extremely vulnerable to earthquakes due to the location of its active faults and its dense population. Assessing the probable damage of a high magnitude earthquake on buildings and facilities relies on a precise structural survey, which has an empirical basis depending on historic ground motions. The probability of damage and failure in discrete limits based on different ground motions is estimated by fragility curves. Using the most matching fragility curves for buildings in Tehran, the vulnerability of the hospitals in the capital, as one of the most critical structures in crisis management of disasters, was investigated in this study. Subsequently, the existing fragility curves, developed for Tehran and the other seismic prone countries such as Japan and the United States, were compared considering the typology of Tehran’s hospitals. Finally, the possible damages for each hospital were calculated based on the most conservative fragility curve and the most pessimistic scenario, which were used to evaluate the seismic vulnerability of hospitals and health care systems for different damage states. After zoning the damage of therapeutic areas of Tehran, it was observed that at least 2% to 10% damage occurred in all hospitals of Tehran, and none of the healthcare centers would remain structurally undamaged after a strong earthquake with the moment magnitude of 7 or more. In addition, the healthcare buildings could be prone to significant structural damage, especially in southern parts, which necessitates proactive management plans for Tehran metropolitan area. © 2021 by the authors.

12925,"The knowledge about potential flood damage is a key issue for disaster risk reduction. However, the scarcity of empirical data has limited flood damage modeling in several regions. As a result, studies in data-scarce regions have mostly been restricted to either building exposure assessment or identification of vulnerability indicators without a further linkage to probable damage. As expert-based approaches do not require empirical damage data, they have a high potential for flood damage modeling in data-scarce regions. In this study, we carried out a comparative assessment between an expert-based and a data-driven approach. The expert-based approach systematically combines the vulnerability indicator method and synthetic what-if analysis based on the knowledge of regional experts. The data-driven approach integrates empirical flood damage data in the analysis applying a multivariate random forest model. Flood damage data, collected through interviews after two flood events in 2017 and 2019 at separate locations in Nigeria, were used to evaluate the performance of both methods based on developed damage grades. Results from both methods showed i) a predictive accuracy of 30% and 38% for the expert-based and data-driven approaches respectively, ii) that distance to channel, wall material, building condition, and building quality are significant regional damage drivers, and iii) comparable model performance can be achieved even with a reduced number of variables. Furthermore, the study demonstrated how experts are likely to underestimate damage at low water depths and how a difference in conformity to building standards can add to challenges in flood damage prediction. © 2021 The Author(s)",Expert-based versus data-driven flood damage models: A comparative evaluation for data-scarce regions,2021,Damage grades; Damage prediction; Data-driven; Data-scarce; Expert-based; Flood,None,1,1
12936,"This paper proposes a novel methodology for developing fire fragility functions for an entire steel building - meaning that the function is not specific to a location within the building. The aim is to characterize the probabilistic vulnerability of steel buildings to fire in the context of community resilience assessment. In developing the fragility functions, uncertainties in the fire model, the heat transfer model and the thermo-mechanical response are considered. In addition several fire scenarios at different locations in the building are studied. Monte Carlo Simulations and Latin Hypercube Sampling are used to generate the probability distributions of demand placed on the members and structural capacity relative to selected damage thresholds. By assessing demand and capacity in the temperature domain, the thermal and the structural problems can be treated separately to improve the efficiency of the probabilistic analysis. After the probability distributions are obtained for demand and capacity, the fragility functions can be obtained by convolution of the distributions. Finally, event tree analysis is used to combine the functions associated with fire scenarios in different building locations. The developed fire fragility functions yield the probability of exceedance of predefined damage states as a function of the fire load in the building. The methodology is illustrated on an example consisting in a prototype nine-story steel building based on the SAC project. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Fire fragility curves for steel buildings in a community context: A methodology,2016,Community risk assessment; Fire; Fragility analysis; Steel building; Structural reliability; Urban resilience,Buildings; Fires; Heat transfer; Intelligent systems; Location; Monte Carlo methods; Probability; Reliability analysis; Risk assessment; Structural analysis; Community risk assessments; Fragility analysis; Steel buildings; Structural reliability; Urban resilience; Probability distributions; fire; Monte Carlo analysis; multistorey building; numerical model; reliability analysis; resilience; risk assessment; steel; structural analysis,0,1
12942,"Flood damage modelling is becoming an essential component in flood risk management. However damage assessments are affected by large uncertainty, mainly related to the use of depth–damage functions. In some countries, where no site-specific curves are available, a transfer of damage models developed from other areas is required, adding extra uncertainty in the modelling process. This paper discusses the transferability in space of damage curves from literature, with a focus on ‘function uncertainty’, pointing out, especially for mesoscale ones, the lack of detailed information in terms of flood and/or building characteristics that can allow to identify the conditions of applicability of the models. New site-specific depth–damage functions are then developed for the residential sector, at meso- and microscale, based on damage data from the 2010 flood in Veneto, Italy. The application of the new curves reveals a better performance of the mesoscale model compared with the more detailed microscale one, probably due to the small extent of the inundated area. © 2015 The Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management (CIWEM) and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Flood damage curves: new insights from the 2010 flood in Veneto, Italy",2017,depth–damage curves; flood damage assessment; Italy; mesoscale analysis; microscale analysis; uncertainty; validation; vulnerability,flood control; flood damage; literature review; mesoscale eddy; performance assessment; residential location; risk assessment; uncertainty analysis; vulnerability; Italy; Veneto,1,1
12946,"This paper presents a probabilistic approach for flood risk assessment in a reach of the Richelieu River, south of Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu, Quebec, Canada. The approach is based on a combination of three simple modules: 1) flood frequency analysis (frequency and peak discharge), 2) estimation of inundation depth, and 3) damage and loss estimation. To assess the flood negative impacts, a simple hydraulic model is developed designed to replace and complement the existing 2D model coupled to an existing damage model. By simplifying the spatial coverage of flood calculations, this approach accelerates the computational efficiency enabling a broader set of elements to be combined in a large sample of Monte Carlo simulations applied in the flood risk assessment. The final result is a local scale risk map indicating the expected annual damage to each individual building in the study area useful for flood risk decision making. The analyses show that the approach is particularly powerful for flood risk assessments in areas adjacent to the river for which sufficient data is available. © 2018","Flood risk mapping for direct damage to residential buildings in Quebec, Canada",2019,2D model; Decision making; Expected annual damage; Flood risk; Monte Carlo,None,1,1
12949,"In seismic reliability analysis the total failure probability is determined by combining the fragility curve – representing the response of the structure to seismic excitation – with the seismic hazard curve. The determination of fragility curves has a long tradition in the nuclear industry and reaches back to the 1970s. Since the late 1990s also for ordinary buildings seismic reliability analysis became more important and formed the bases for the development of new seismic standards. Several methods are available to build fragility curves. They are relying on different assumptions and restrictions, as well as levels of detail. In this paper, different fragility analysis methods are described and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed: (i) the safety factor method, in which the fragility curve is estimated based on safety margins with respect on an existing deterministic design; the numerical simulation method, in which the parameters of the fragility curve are obtained by (ii) regression analysis or (iii) maximum likelihood estimation from a set of nonlinear time history analysis at different seismic levels; (iv) the incremental dynamic analysis method where a set of accelerograms is scaled until failure. These four fragility analysis methods are applied to determine fragility curves for the 3-storey reinforced concrete shear wall building of the SMART2013 benchmark project. Advantages and disadvantages of the methods are illustrated and the impact of the simplifying assumptions (e.g. lognormal curves, scaling) are assessed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Fragility analysis methods: Review of existing approaches and application,2017,None,Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; Nuclear industry; Numerical methods; Regression analysis; Reinforced concrete; Safety factor; Seismic design; Seismology; Shear walls; Deterministic design; Incremental dynamic analysis; Nonlinear time history analysis; Numerical simulation method; Reinforced concrete shear walls; Safety factor methods; Seismic excitations; Simplifying assumptions; Reliability analysis,1,1
12951,"The purpose of this study is to develop the fragility curve associated with a real building. An approach to estimate seismic fragility without the need to perform the nonlinear dynamic analysis for determining the damage state of the structure as well as without the need to perform the Monte Carlo simulation for calculating the damage probability with respect to ground motion of different intensities is developed here. The capacity spectrum method is modified to determine the damage state of the target building. Consequently, nonlinear push over analysis is performed to obtain the capacity curve of the building and the damage states of the structure can then be determined by using the performance curve derived from capacity curve and code spectrum associated with ground motion within certain range of peak ground acceleration (PGA) values. Fragility curves in this study are assumed to be lognormal distribution described by two parameters and are developed as a function of PGA. The estimation of these two parameters is done by the maximum likelihood method treating each event of damage as a realization from a Bernoulli experiment. In fact, genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to obtain the parameters. The uncertainty associated with the ground motion is simulated by analyzing the statistical characteristics of the records of ground motion collected near the site. In addition, the uncertainties associated with the capacity spectrum and the thresholds of different damage states are also analyzed. Finally, fragility curves considering different level of uncertainties are constructed and compared for target building.

12959,"Current guidelines for design and assessment of buildings under tsunami actions do not explicitly state how to apply tsunami loads to buildings and which analysis methods to use in order to assess the structural response to the tsunami loads. In this paper, a reinforced concrete (RC) moment-resisting frame, which is designed as a tsunami evacuation building, is selected as a case study and subjected to simulated 2011 Tohoku tsunami waves. To assess tsunami impact on the model building, different nonlinear static analyses, i.e. constant-height pushover (CHPO) and variable-height pushover (VHPO), are compared with nonlinear dynamic analysis. The results of VHPO provide a good prediction of engineering demand parameters and collapse fragility curves obtained from the dynamic analysis under a wide range of tsunami loading. On the other hand, CHPO tends to overestimate interstorey drift ratio (IDR) and underestimate column shear by about 5–20%. It provides a larger fragility, i.e. about 10% in median value, for global failure and a smaller fragility for local shear failure. On the basis of these results, it is recommended that VHPO be used in future fragility analysis of buildings subjected to tsunami. However, pushover methods might not be adequate in cases where the tsunami inundation force time-histories are characterised by a “double-peak”, which subjects the structure to a two-cycle load. Finally, it is found that tsunami peak force is better correlated to IDR than flow velocity and inundation depth for the considered structure. This suggests that the peak force would be a more efficient intensity measure than the other two in the development of tsunami fragility curves. © 2017 The Authors",Fragility assessment of a RC structure under tsunami actions via nonlinear static and dynamic analyses,2017,Analysis methodology; Fragility curve; Pushover analysis; Time-history analysis; Tsunami engineering; Tsunami force; Tsunami simulation,Buildings; Dynamic analysis; Floods; Flow velocity; Nonlinear analysis; Reinforced concrete; Tsunamis; Analysis methodology; Fragility curves; Push-over analysis; Time history analysis; Tsunami forces; Tsunami simulation; Structural design; computer simulation; concrete structure; dynamic analysis; reinforced concrete; tsunami,1,1
12963,"The 2003 earthquake in the Greek island of Lefkas, has revived the interest for the local anti-seismic technique based on the use of timber-framed masonry, whose adequate performance during the earthquake revealed the merits of this rather sophisticated, albeit traditional, construction. A key feature of the Lefkas structures is their dual structural system. The secondary system is activated once the ground storey stone masonry piers of the primary system (which includes timber-framed masonry in all storeys) fail. In this regard, two different structural models are presented herein to simulate the response of each system. A macro-model based on nonlinear (NL) strut elements and point plastic hinges is intended to model the timber-framed masonry. NL analyses are carried out for one, two and three storey buildings, which represent the most common cases in Lefkas. Furthermore, an investigation is carried out regarding the foundation of the buildings resting on soft alluvial deposits. Pushover curves are derived from the NL analyses of the buildings and are then converted to capacity curves using the characteristics of the predominant mode. On these curves four damage states (slight damage, moderate damage, heavy damage, and collapse) are defined on the basis of criteria related to the actual response of the building. Then, fragility curves in terms of spectral displacement are generated, adopting a log-normal statistical distribution. These curves are converted into PGA values using a selected response spectrum. Utilising these fragility curves a seismic loss scenario for the 2003 Lefkas earthquake is developed for the timber-framed masonry stock of Lefkas city. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Fragility curves and loss estimation for traditional timber-framed masonry buildings in Lefkas, Greece",2015,Capacity curves; Fragility curves in terms of PGA; Fragility curves in terms of Sd; Lefkas traditional buildings; Loss assessment; Timber-framed masonry buildings,None,1,1
12966,"The 63,605 damaged buildings from the 2011 Tohoku-oki tsunami in Ishinomaki were used to develop 52 fragility curves using linear regression. The data comprise the damage level and the measured inundation depth for each building. In agreement with previous studies, the present results indicate that reinforced concrete and steel buildings with three stories or more perform better under tsunami loading. Performance with respect to their intended function was found to depend mainly on structural material. Moreover, based on Japan's design code for earthquake-resistant buildings, buildings constructed after 1981 do not display a better performance compared to more recent constructions. Finally, the results show that for the same inundation depth, a higher damage probability exists along a ria coast due to higher flow velocities, confirmed by numerical simulation and survivor videos. These new findings are useful for building damage assessment, town reconstruction, and comparison of vulnerability functions in future studies. © 2015, Earthquake Engineering Research Institute.","Fragility curves based on data from the 2011 Tohoku-oki Tsunami in Ishinomaki City, with discussion of parameters influencing building damage",2015,None,Damage detection; Earthquake engineering; Floods; Reinforced concrete; Tsunamis; Building damage; Damage level; Damage probability; Design codes; Earthquake-resistant buildings; Fragility curves; Steel buildings; Tohoku-oki tsunamis; Buildings; architectural design; dynamic response; earthquake damage; linearity; performance assessment; reinforced concrete; seismic design; seismic response; structural response; Tohoku earthquake 2011; vulnerability; Honshu; Ishinomaki; Japan; Miyagi; Tohoku,1,1
12967,"A series of earthquakes hit Kumamoto Prefecture in Kyushu Island, Japan, on April 14 and 16, 2016. A large number of buildings, mostly wooden houses, were damaged. This study developed fragility curves of buildings using the damage survey data provided by the Uki City government. The damage ratios of buildings were investigated from the viewpoints of the structural material and the construction period. As the result, the damage ratio of wooden buildings was found to be larger than those of other structural materials, and the damage ratios of major, moderate+, and moderate- got smaller as the construction period became newer. Empirical fragility curves of buildings for Uki City were constructed based on the damage survey data and the estimated peak ground velocity (PGV). Compared with the result of the previous study for Mashiki Town due the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, the major damage ratios of wooden buildings for Uki City was shown in a lower level than those for Mashiki Town in the same PGV. The fragility curves for Uki City were obtained using the damage survey data in the smaller PGV range than that for Mashiki Town, thus the regression results reflected the damage trend in the small PGVs. The fragility curves for Uki City and Mashiki Town due the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake were compared with those for Nishinomiya City and Nada Ward due the 1995 Kobe earthquake.

12968,"A hybrid seismic fragility model for territorial-scale seismic vulnerability assessment of masonry buildings is developed and presented in this paper. The method combines expert-judgment and mechanical approaches to derive typological fragility curves for Italian residential masonry building stock. The first classifies Italian masonry buildings in five different typological classes as function of age of construction, structural typology, and seismic behaviour and damaging of buildings observed following the most severe earthquakes occurred in Italy. The second, based on numerical analyses results conducted on building prototypes, provides all the parameters necessary for developing fragility functions. Peak-Ground Acceleration (PGA) at Ultimate Limit State attainable by each building’s class has been chosen as an Intensity Measure to represent fragility curves: three types of curve have been developed, each referred to mean, maximum and minimum value of PGAs defined for each building class. To represent the expected damage scenario for increasing earthquake intensities, a correlation between PGAs and Mercalli-Cancani-Sieber macroseismic intensity scale has been used and the corresponding fragility curves developed. Results show that the proposed building’s classes are representative of the Italian masonry building stock and that fragility curves are effective for predicting both seismic vulnerability and expected damage scenarios for seismic-prone areas. Finally, the fragility curves have been compared with empirical curves obtained through a macroseismic approach on Italian masonry buildings available in literature, underlining the differences between the methods. © 2021, The Author(s).",Fragility curves for Italian URM buildings based on a hybrid method,2021,Fragility curves; Hybrid method; Territorial-scale; Typological classification; URM buildings,Earthquakes; Masonry construction; Masonry materials; Seismic response; Building prototypes; Earthquake intensity; Fragility function; Macroseismic intensity; Peak ground acceleration; Seismic vulnerability; Structural typologies; Ultimate limit state; Buildings; damage mechanics; detection method; earthquake damage; earthquake event; masonry; vulnerability; Italy,1,1

12972,"Malawi is located within the southern branch of the active East African Rift System, where earthquakes of moment magnitude (Mw) 7.0 or greater can occur along major faults. The majority of dwellings in the country are non-engineered unreinforced masonry constructions, built by local artisans with little input from engineers. These constructions are highly vulnerable to seismic events due to poor-quality materials and lack of construction detailing. This study presents a new methodology to assess the seismic fragility curves of typical dwellings located in the Central and Southern Malawi. On-site inspections of buildings are carried out to assess geometrical and structural features of 646 façades, and an experimental campaign is performed to characterise the mechanical properties of local construction materials. The collected data allow the identification of different building typologies in terms of quality of materials and construction techniques. The critical failure modes for each of the inspected façade at their ultimate limit state are evaluated analytically. Damage limit states are defined and adopted to derive simplified Static Push-Over (SPO) curves, transformed into incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) curves by using SPO2IDA. The IDA curves are then used to obtain fragility curves for the specific damage limit states. The fragility curves presented herein are the first to be calculated for these building typologies, based on local data, and unfortunately, they show that buildings in Malawi are far more vulnerable to earthquakes than estimated from previously available international reference data. The fragility curves developed in this study may prove useful for assessing the seismic risk of these building typologies in Malawi and other East African countries. © 2021, The Author(s).",Fragility curves for non-engineered masonry buildings in developing countries derived from real data based on structural surveys and laboratory tests,2021,Fragility curves; Laboratory testing; Mechanical approach; Non-engineered unreinforced masonry buildings; SPO2IDA; Structural survey,Developing countries; Housing; Masonry construction; Masonry materials; Risk assessment; Building typologies; Construction technique; Experimental campaign; Incremental dynamic analysis; Quality of materials; Seismic fragility curves; Structural surveys; Ultimate limit state; Earthquakes,1,1
12975,"Earthquake-induced landslides are strongly dangerous secondary events of earthquakes, which every year cause huge losses around the world. In this paper, the structures at the toe of slopes subjected to the impact of landslides were considered. A probabilistic procedure developed in another paper is applied to two-story reinforced concrete building without infill walls. A method to evaluate cumulative damage to structures due to earthquake shaking and landslide impact was implemented through MATLAB. The variability in landslide-related loading, in terms of extension in plan and impact angle, was considered. A 2D frame was taken out from a 3D model and sequential response analysis was carried out on both models through OpenSees. Uncertainties were modelled through probability distributions of primary variables that mostly influence structural response, allowing the derivation of fragility curves via simulation. The probability of collapse was investigated under varying peak ground acceleration and impact velocity, which were considered as intensity measures for earthquake shaking and landslide impact, respectively. © 2020 European Association for Structural Dynamics.

12980,"Susceptibility to structural damage can be characterized by a fragility curve, which is expressed as a normal or lognormal cumulative distribution of the conditional probabilities of reaching or exceeding a particular damage state, for given values of the demand parameter. Such curves have been produced for a variety of damage states in different categories of buildings exposed to tsunami loading in different parts of the world, with the demand parameter taken as inundation depth. Harmonization was sought across these studies with respect to the median inundation depth. Three categories of single-storey buildings were identified based on construction material, namely reinforced concrete, masonry and timber. The median inundation depths for the complete damage state decreased from reinforced concrete (5.4–7.3 m) through masonry (2.3–2.5 m) to timber (~1.6 m) structures. The fairly narrow ranges above represent a number of different studies and indicate that a common family of curves or “bands” can be arrived at. Such ranges were identified for other partial damage states too. Our genuinely original contribution is a probabilistic model that was developed using a Monte Carlo simulation to produce synthetic fragility functions for masonry and reinforced concrete structures under tsunami loading. The probabilistic model consisted of a geometric model that captured the geometrical and wall-type variations of the building lot, a loading function and a set of failure criteria, all of which required appropriate simplifying assumptions. The resulting synthetic fragility curves matched the fragility curves based on observed tsunami damage for the complete collapse damage state reasonably well. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Fragility curves for structures under tsunami loading,2016,Construction material; Damage state; Failure criterion; Fragility curves; Inundation depth; Monte Carlo simulation,failure analysis; loading; Monte Carlo analysis; numerical model; probability; reinforced concrete; structural analysis; tsunami,1,1

A revised set of fragility curves has also been prepared in which the bias in the curve resulting from the uncertainty in the ground motion parameter has been removed. The uncertainty in the fragility curves is evaluated and discussed and the curves are compared with those from other studies.

12994,"Despite realizing the importance of risk-based frameworks in fire engineering, current fire safety guidelines are largely prescriptive and over-conservative in nature, which do not consider the effect of uncertainties influencing the fire resistance of the structural systems. In this context, a probabilistic framework is presented to investigate vulnerability of a reinforced concrete (RC) portal frame subjected to fire. Here, a three-dimensional (3-D) nonlinear finite element (FE) model for the RC portal frame exposed to elevated temperature is developed, and transient thermo-mechanical analysis is carried out by duly incorporating temperature variation of thermal and mechanical properties of concrete and steel rebar. Probabilistic study is conducted by developing fragility curves based on limit state of deflection to quantify the vulnerability of the structural members exposed to fire loading. Parametric studies are conducted by varying the material properties of the RC portal frame to investigate the influence of uncertainties in the fire loading on its structural performance and fragility. The failure probability starts at a higher fire load density (450 MJ/m(2)) for the structure with higher concrete grade as compared to the relatively lower fire load density (200 MJ/m(2)) for lower grade. Therefore, the fire resistance of the RC structures has been recommended to be based on the strength of the member, rather than merely sizes of the members. The proposed stochastic analysis framework, thereby, provides a rational approach to improve the performance based fire design of RC structures at member and structure levels by identifying the parameters affecting the structural fire resistance.",Framework for fragility assessment of reinforced concrete portal frame subjected to elevated temperature,2020,Concrete; Fire; Fragility; Stochastic; Thermal; Vulnerability,HIGH-STRENGTH CONCRETE; FIRE SAFETY; RELIABILITY-ANALYSIS; NUMERICAL-ANALYSIS; STEEL COLUMNS; BEAMS; PERFORMANCE; BUILDINGS; BEHAVIOR; DESIGN,0,1
13007,"Physical vulnerability of buildings is one of the key parameters needed to assess earthquake risk and to address appropriate disaster management interventions in earthquake prone countries. In order to evaluate this parameter, appropriate fragility functions prepared based on local construction should be applied. However, in Iran reliable fragility curves for different types of buildings have not been developed yet. To address this issue, 19 sets of fragility curves for different types of buildings of Iran were generated in this study, based on empirical approach, incorporated with statistical analysis. Accordingly, at first, different types of common buildings in Iran such as steel frame, reinforced concrete, and masonry buildings were classified into 19 categories. Then, appropriate fragility curves were generated for each class, using existing empirical fragility curves in Iran as well as those proposed for similar types of buildings in other countries. For this purpose, a statistical approach was adopted to weight different curves based on the construction provisions and expert’s judgment. Finally, fragility curves obtained from this study were validated with the observed damages of the previous earthquakes in Iran that shows acceptable compatibility. The proposed approach provides more reliable results for vulnerability assessments in Iran and can be employed in other regions having similar conditions. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Generation of new fragility curves for common types of buildings in Iran,2020,Fragility curve; Iranian buildings; Seismic risk; Vulnerability,Disaster prevention; Disasters; Earthquakes; Reinforced concrete; Risk assessment; Disaster management; Empirical approach; Fragility curves; Iranian buildings; Seismic risk; Statistical approach; Vulnerability; Vulnerability assessments; Buildings; building; disaster management; earthquake engineering; earthquake event; empirical analysis; failure mechanism; masonry; reinforced concrete; vulnerability; Iran,1,1
13093,"Conventional seismic performance evaluation methods for building structures with soil– structure interaction effects are inefficient for regional seismic damage assessment as a predisaster management system. Therefore, this study presented the framework to develop an artificial neural network-based model, which can rapidly predict seismic responses with soil–structure interaction effects and determine the seismic performance levels. To train, validate and test the model, 11 input parameters were selected as main parameters, and the seismic responses with the soil–structure interaction were generated using a multistep analysis process proposed in this study. The artificial neural network model generated reliable seismic responses with the soil–structure interaction effects, and it rapidly extended the seismic response database using a simple structure and soil information. This data generation method with high accuracy and speed can be utilized as a regional seismic assessment tool for safe and sustainable structures against natural disasters. © 2021 by the authors.

13094,"Steel frames equipped with buckling restrained braces (BRBs) have been increasingly applied in earthquake-prone areas given their excellent capacity for resisting lateral forces. Therefore, special attention has been paid to the seismic risk assessment (SRA) of such structures, e.g., seismic fragility analysis. Conventional approaches, e.g., nonlinear finite element simulation (NFES), are computationally inefficient for SRA analysis particularly for large-scale steel BRB frame structures. In this study, amachine learning (ML)-based seismic fragility analysis framework is established to effectively assess the risk to structures under seismic loading conditions. An optimal artificial neural network model can be trained using calculated damage and intensity measures, a technique which will be used to compute the fragility curves of a steel BRB frame instead of employing NFES. Numerical results show that a highly efficient instantaneous failure probability assessment can be made with the proposed framework for realistic large-scale building structures.",Machine Learning-Based Seismic Fragility Analysis of Large-Scale Steel Buckling Restrained Brace Frames,2020,Machine learning; Monte Carlo simulation; regression method; fragility analysis; buckling restrained braces,STRUCTURAL RELIABILITY-ANALYSIS; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; RESPONSE-SURFACE METHOD; BUILDINGS; DESIGN,1,1
13104,"Seismic risk assessment at the territorial level is now widely recognised as essential for countries with intense seismic activity, such as Italy. Academia is called to give its contribution in order to synergically deepen the knowledge about the various components of this risk, starting from the complex evaluation of vulnerability of the built heritage. In line with this, a mechanics-based seismic fragility model for Italian residential masonry buildings was developed and presented in this paper. This model is based on the classification of the building stock in macro-typologies, defined by age of construction and number of storeys, which being information available at national level, allow simulating damage scenarios and carrying out risk analyses on a territorial scale. The model is developed on the fragility of over 500 buildings, sampled according to national representativeness criteria and analysed through the Vulnus_4.0 software. The calculated fragility functions were extended on the basis of a reference model available in the literature, which provides generic fragilities for the EMS98 vulnerability classes, thus obtaining a fragility model defined on the five EMS98 damage states. Lastly, to assess the reliability of the proposed model, this was used to simulate damage scenarios due to the 2009 L’Aquila earthquake. Overall, the comparison between model results and observed damage showed a good fit, proving the model effectiveness. © 2020, The Author(s).",Mechanics-based fragility curves for Italian residential URM buildings,2021,Fragility model; Macro-typologies; Residential masonry buildings; Seismic damage scenarios; Seismic risk management; Territorial-scale seismic vulnerability,Classification (of information); Earthquakes; Housing; Risk analysis; Risk perception; Complex evaluations; Fragility function; Masonry building; Number of storeys; Reference modeling; Seismic activity; Seismic fragility; Seismic risk assessment; Risk assessment; building; classification; complexity; damage mechanics; residential location; risk assessment; software; typology; vulnerability; Italy; Aquila,1,1
13105,"Purpose Despite recognizing the significance of risk-based frameworks in fire safety engineering, the usual approach in structural fire design is largely member/component level, wherein effect of uncertainties influencing the fire resistance of structures are not explicitly considered. In this context, a probabilistic framework is presented to investigate the vulnerability of a reinforced concrete (RC) members and structure under fire loading scenario. Design/methodology/approach The RC structures exposed to fire are modeled in a finite element (FE) platform incorporating material and geometric nonlinearity, in which the transient thermo-mechanical analysis is carried out by suitably incorporating the temperature variation of thermal and mechanical properties of both concrete and steel rebar. The stochasticity in the system is considered in structural resistance, thermal and fire model parameters, and the subsequent fragility curves are developed considering threshold limit state of deflection. Findings The fire resistance of RC structure is reported to be significantly lower in comparison to the RC members, thereby illustrating the current prescriptive design approaches based on studies of structural member behavior to be crucial from a safety and reliability point of view. Practical implications The framework developed for the vulnerability assessment of RC structures under fire hazard through FE analysis can be effectively used to estimate the structural fire resistance for other similar structure to enhance safety and reliability of structures under such extreme threats. Originality/value The paper proposes a novel methodology for vulnerability assessment of three-dimensional RC structures under fire hazard through FE analysis and provides comparison of the structural fragility with fragility developed for structural members. Moreover, the research emphasizes to assume 3D behavior of the structure rather than the approximate 2D behavior.",Member and structural fragility of reinforced concrete structure under fire,2020,Vulnerability; Concrete; Fire; Fragility; Thermal; Stochastic,HIGH-STRENGTH CONCRETE; RELIABILITY-ANALYSIS; SEISMIC FRAGILITY; STORAGE TANKS; BEAMS; DESIGN; UNCERTAINTY; RESISTANCE; BUILDINGS; SAFETY,0,1
13111,"Current flood vulnerability analyses rely on deterministic methods (e.g., stage-damage functions) to quantify resulting damage and losses to the built environment. While such approaches have been used extensively by communities, they do not enable the propagation of uncertainty into a risk- or resilience-informed decision process. In this paper, a method that allows the development of building fragility and building loss functions is articulated and applied to develop an archetype portfolio that can be used to model buildings in a typical community. The typical single-variable flood vulnerability function, normally based on flood depth, is extended to a multi-variate flood vulnerability function, which is a function of both flood depth and flood duration, thereby creating fragility surfaces. The portfolio presented herein consists of 15 building archetypes that can serve to populate a community-level model to predict damage and resulting functionality from a scenario flood event. The prediction of damage and functionality of buildings within a community is the first step in developing risk-informed mitigation decisions to improve community resilience.",Minimal Building Flood Fragility and Loss Function Portfolio for Resilience Analysis at the Community Level,2020,flood risk; flood damage; flood fragility; flood loss; community resilience; multi-variate analysis,RISK-ASSESSMENT; RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS; DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; UNCERTAINTY; MODEL; METHODOLOGY,1,1
13112,"Tornadoes are considered a low-probability high-consequence event that can cause significant damage to community infrastructure, resulting in injuries and fatalities and ultimately creating long-term socioeconomic losses. Community resilience requires not only that the performance level of individual facilities be modeled and understood, but also their synthesis in space and time. Fragilities are conditional statistical distributions that provide the probability of exceeding analyst-defined performance levels as a function of hazard (or loading) intensity. Fragilities are becoming a core component in community resilience studies and enable the analyst to model performance of individual components or a cluster of the infrastructure, thereby supporting risk-informed decision making at the community level. In this paper, tornado fragilities for a portfolio of nonresidential buildings are developed. These fragilities, combined with several existing tornado building fragilities from the literature, are proposed to represent a first comprehensive minimum size portfolio of tornado building fragilities needed to model a community. For illustration, they are then used in the Centerville virtual community to perform community-level building damage assessment. This minimal-level portfolio of building fragilities lays the foundation for post-tornado recovery and resilience studies of a community, which eventually requires inclusion of all physical and nonphysical infrastructure. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Minimal Building Fragility Portfolio for Damage Assessment of Communities Subjected to Tornadoes,2018,Building portfolio; Centerville virtual community; Community resilience; Spatial building damage; Tornado; Tornado fragility,Buildings; Decision making; Probability distributions; Social networking (online); Tornadoes; Virtual reality; Building damage; Community resiliences; Damage assessments; Individual components; Nonresidential buildings; Risk-informed decision making; Statistical distribution; Virtual community; Damage detection,1,1
13122,"Performing probabilistic damage assessment for a community under a tropical cyclone event needs to consider the collective damage of individual structures within the community, which involves modeling the spatial correlations of hazard demands and structural capacities between individual structures. However, how to model these two kinds of spatial correlations and how they influence the damage assessment remain unclear. In this paper, focus is given to the roof sheathing damage of a residential building portfolio consisting of multiple wooden residential buildings under the wind loads of a tropical cyclone event. Two methods are used to predict the damage of individual buildings based on their hazard demands: one is using a direct Monte Carlo Simulation in which structural (capacity) parameters of different buildings are treated as correlated. This method provides accurate results but needs a lot of information. Another approach is to probabilistically predict the damage state of each building based on its hazard demand using its fragility functions. The relative importance of the correlations of hazard demands and structural capacities is investigated. It is demonstrated that the correlations of damage states are strongly dependent on hazard demands. Finally, a method is developed to simulate correlated damage states of a building portfolio given hazard demands, through incorporating the hazard-dependent correlations with fragility functions using Gaussian Copula. © 13th International Conference on Applications of Statistics and Probability in Civil Engineering, ICASP 2019.

First, ground motion sequences together with building attribute data are adopted as inputs of the proposed MI-CNN model. Second, the prediction accuracy of MI-CNN model is discussed comprehensively for different scenarios. The overall prediction accuracy is 79.7%, and the prediction accuracies for all scenarios are above 77%, indicating a good prediction performance of the proposed method. The computation efficiency of the proposed method is 340 times faster than that of the nonlinear multi-degree-of-freedom shear model using time history analysis. Third, a case study is conducted for reinforced concrete (RC) frame buildings in Shenzhen city, and two seismic scenarios (i.e., M6.5 and M7.5) are studied for the area.

13142,"Propagating uncertainties in flood damage models is a critical step towards a risk-informed decision methodology that is based on quantitative assessment. Flood-related data scarcity and the use of deterministic models present challenges when seeking to include uncertainties in flood damage modeling. In this paper, a single-variable and multi-variate component-based flood fragility method is proposed. The method uses expert-based data derived from online sources that are applied within a Monte Carlo framework to divide the building into independent components and then assigns these components to five predefined damage states that describe the building damage as a whole. Using a series of Monte Carlo simulations, uncertainties in flood depth and flood duration that result in each damage level for each component were propagated. Their damage is then characterized using component fragility functions to be used to develop total building fragility and loss functions. The resulting fragilities can be used as a probabilistic vulnerability function to be assigned to a real community based on building archetype and occupancy.

Summary of field observation is presented first and empirical fragility curves are developed from the detailed damage assessment data from 603 villages in central, eastern and western Nepal. Fragility curves are developed on the basis of 665,515 building damage cases collected during the post-earthquake detailed damage assessment campaign conducted by Government of Nepal. Two sets of fragility functions are derived using peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration at 0.3 s as the intensity measures. The sum of the results highlights that stone masonry buildings in Nepal are highly vulnerable even in the case of low to moderate ground shaking.

13208,"Scientific community showed particular interest in tsunami risk assessment in the last years due to several worldwide tsunami events where high damages and human casualties were recorded during post-event surveys. This paper investigates the behaviour of Italian coastal residential masonry buildings under tsunami loads. Main fragility curves available in literature are based on empirical databases and consequentially, the structural behaviour is strictly related to local building typologies of other countries. For masonry buildings, it is complex to predict global response due to high material inhomogeneity, especially in the case of regional scale analysis; a critical review on local mechanisms activation of masonry walls under tsunami loads is briefly performed. Therefore, local mechanisms activation for masonry walls are investigated depending on out-of-plane and in-plane mechanisms assuming flexural and shear failure. Structures designed for gravity or seismic loads are generated based on several building classes depending on number of storeys and age of construction. Monte Carlo analyses generated building models for each identified building class to simulate the behaviour of Italian masonry buildings. Preliminary analytical tsunami fragility curves are developed in order to assess the vulnerability of Italian coastal residential masonry buildings under tsunami loads.

13212,"Fragility curves are very useful in quantifying the physical and economic damage of buildings that have undergone an earthquake. This paper presents the development of analytical fragility curves representative of mid-rise residential structures built with reinforced concrete, taking into account the specific structural characteristics of Algerian buildings. The derivation of the analytical fragility curves is based on the capacity spectrum method (CSM), which combines a non-linear static analysis (pushover) with a response spectrum analysis. Observation of the consequences of earthquakes of a given intensity shows that the damage to buildings is not identical, even though their construction is similar. This variability of damage can be explained by the variability of a large number of factors such as the local intensity of the hazard, the heterogeneity of the terrain, and the mechanical and geometrical characteristics of the constructions. The materials and patterns of demand spectra were considered as random variables using the Latin Hypercube Sampling Technique. Most of the existing methods that model the damage to structures accept a log-normal distribution hypothesis, where the log-normal law is a model controlled by two parameters: its mean value and its standard deviation. To set these parameters, Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) are performed to generate 1000 samples. The resulting fragility curves following these analyses were applied to two real-life cases of buildings affected by the earthquake of Beni-Ilmane 2010 (Msila, Algeria), so as to assess the damage. © 2017 Materials and Energy Research Center.

13213,"The article presents a probabilistic criteria for the damage and loss assessment of buildings exposed to strong wind hazard. The criteria include the development of fragility curves, within the Federal Emergency Management Agency style, for appropriate damage states on a hotel building and contents due to the loss of nonstructural elements, like facades and the partial or total loss of contents because of water infiltration. The loss estimation includes loss components like the business interruption due to repairs/reconstruction work and, throughout a new estimation that considers mitigation measures to upgrade the building, it is shown that these measures reduce the loss in a significant level. The probabilistic description of wind-induced pressure on facades and windows resorts on the wind velocity distribution, and their resistances consider data and statistics from manufacturers. The calculation of failure probabilities makes use of Monte Carlo simulations for the considered modes: windows/façade anchorage failure, glass braking due to wind pressure and impact of airborne debris. The probabilistic distribution of rainfall, given the occurrence of a hurricane and the subsequent water infiltration, serves to assess damages on structures under strong wind hazard. A hotel building recently damaged by the hurricane Odile in Baja California Sur, México is used to illustrate the formulation.

13218,"The most common and internationally accepted method of assessing building damage due to flooding is through the application of a depth-damage curve (DDC). A DDC relates the percent damage or estimated economic loss to a buildings' structural integrity and/or contents directly to a given water level (depth). The DDC generally represents an average structure within a given building category, e.g. one-storey single-family residence. Given the great variability across any given structural category, the variation in building materials, construction quality across communities and the singular focus on depth for estimation of losses, it is important to communicate the uncertainty and potential variability of the expected losses in any assessment. In this paper, probabilistic depth-damage curves (PDDCs) are developed based on synthetically derived DDCs from communities in southern Ontario. The generated PDDCs are based on assumed loss thresholds for minor and major loss levels, as spent in Canadian dollars. The economic loss estimates obtained in this way and their likelihood of being exceeded at any given flood depth express more transparently the potential building losses.

13259,"National Flood Interoperability Experiment (NFIE) derived technologies and workflows will offer the ability to rapidly forecast flood damages. Address Points used by emergency management personnel approximate the locations of buildings, and they are a common operating picture for emergency responders.

To varying degrees, these parcel data describe building characteristics of structures within the parcel. Address Point data with cadastral data offers the ability to rapidly develop building inventories for flood damage estimation. Flood damage forecasts can expedite recovery and improve short-term flood resilience. In this work the authors evaluate Flood Damage Wizard, a proposed open source platform independent methodology. Flood Damage Wizard uses point shapefile building information to estimate flood damage to buildings by finding the appropriate depth-damage function using fuzzy-text matching. The authors apply Flood Damage Wizard using Address Point and parcel datasets to demonstrate a method of estimating flood damage to buildings nearly anywhere within the CONUS.

Under given resilience parameters values, a resilient system is able to recover and be strengthened within a defined recovery period; otherwise, it is a non-resilient system.

13285,"Analytical seismic scenario-based probabilistic fragility relations form the spine of earthquake risk assessment and mitigation of RC high-rise wall buildings. In this study, a framework is proposed to develop both rigorous (refined) and less-demanding (cheaper) fragility relations for such structures. Multi-record incremental dynamic analysis is employed using a new scalar intensity measure and net inter-storey drift as a consistent global damage measure for varying heights of buildings. To illustrate the framework, a 30-storey wall building located in a multiple-scenario earthquake-prone region is analysed. The refined fragility sets are derived using 40 real earthquake records representing two seismic scenarios, while the proposed methodology to develop less-demanding seismic scenario-based fragility relations employs a considerably lower number of earthquake records. In this methodology, a new record selection criterion and a fragility curve tolerance factor are introduced. Finally, the two fragility relation sets for the reference structure are developed, assessed, and compared to provide insights into their features and accuracy. Using the proposed methodology, the study revealed that fairly reliable seismic scenario-based fragility sets can be developed for RC high-rise buildings with a significant reduction in computational time and efforts.

The average damage level suffered by each church was computed considering the global and local behaviors of the structures through a damage index computed as a weighted mean of the levels of damage observed for each mechanism.

13316,"This paper investigated multi-objective seismic damage assessment procedure. Primarily, it estimates damage index (DI) of reinforcement concrete (RC) framed low-rise residential buildings under the seismic ground motions. Three-dimensional DI has been estimated for a four-storey building by Park-Ang method considering irregularities. With increasing storey level, calculation of Park-Ang DI becomes tedious and more time consuming; therefore, this method is difficult to implement in large-scale damage evaluation. In this study, a simplified method has been proposed to estimate global DI (GDI) for regular and irregular buildings. It has been observed that ground floor experiences maximum damage where roof is experiencing least damage. Alternatively, an artificial neural network based prediction model has also been adopted in this paper to minimize the error. Factors affecting GDI of RC framed building has been narrated.

13346,"In Eastern Canada, most of moment resisting reinforced concrete frames with unreinforced masonry infill (MI-MRF) buildings were constructed between 1915 and 1960. These pre-code structures, in terms of seismic requirements, are considered vulnerable to earthquake loading. The goal of this study is to provide a simplified seismic demand and fragility analysis for reliable quantification of their seismic performance under potential future seismic events. Fragility functions represent the probability of damage that corresponds to a specific seismic intensity measure (e.g. peak ground acceleration). A case study three story-three bay MI-MRF was selected to illustrate the procedure. The selected frame was proportioned with compatible characteristics of existing mid-rise frames in Quebec region. A simplified probabilistic nonlinear static procedure was applied to obtain the seismic demand model at increasing levels of seismic intensity. Pushover analysis was conducted on a nonlinear model of the frame to obtain the corresponding lateral load-deformation capacity curve. Masonry infills were modelled as an equivalent diagonal struts and the nonlinear behaviour of the reinforced concrete beams and columns were modelled with concentrated plastic hinges at members' ends. Fragility functions were then developed using an experimental based damage model that correlate the extent of damage to the displacement demand. Damage assessment using the developed functions was conducted for an earthquake scenario compatible with the design level seismic hazard in Quebec City with a 2% probability of exceedance in 50% years. The developed functions are particularly useful in probabilistic based seismic loss assessment and in planning mitigation solutions. © (2015) by the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering All rights reserved.",Seismic fragility analysis of masonry infilled reinforced concrete frame buildings in Eastern Canada,2015,None,Beams and girders; Columns (structural); Concrete beams and girders; Concretes; Damage detection; Earthquakes; Geophysics; Masonry materials; Nonlinear analysis; Reinforced concrete; Seismology; Structural design; Structural frames; Equivalent diagonal struts; Nonlinear static procedure; Probability of exceedance; Reinforced concrete beams; Reinforced concrete frame buildings; Reinforced concrete frames; Seismic fragility analysis; Seismic intensity measures; Seismic design,1,1
13357,"This research study was carried out to analyse the seismic behaviour of ten types of six-storey moment-resisting concrete frames, which were one regular frame and nine setback frames with different building configurations. In this analysis, the setback buildings were mainly studied because they have become increasingly popular in modern multi-storey building construction due to their functional and aesthetic architecture. Incremental dynamics analysis (IDA) was performed on these frames under three sets of repeated ground motion records. Based on the IDA curve, life safety (LS) performance level was considered as the main guideline to develop the fragility curves. The maximum inter-storey drift percentages at each storey level, for all frames and location of plastic hinges for each frame, were clearly determined through IDA. From the fragility curve results, the probability of reaching or exceeding the life safety performance state was determined. The regular frame showed the lowest probability as compared to other frames. Therefore, it is known that the building configuration of frames affects the building’s seismic performance, and thus it should be considered in the building’s seismic design. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Seismic fragility assessment for moment-resisting concrete frame with setback under repeated earthquakes,2019,Fragility curves; Incremental dynamic analysis; Irregular buildings; Regular buildings; Repeated earthquakes,None,1,1

The in-plane response of the corner unit is assessed through a 3D equivalent frame model of the entire aggregate, while the evaluation of its out-of-plane response makes use of the rigid-block assumption. Although evaluated in a separate way, the NDAs performed on the latter are based on the time histories derived from the global 3D model. The results are then processed in order to derive fragility curves, firstly, of the single failure mechanisms and, then, of the overall combined behavior. To this aim, various performance conditions are examined. For the reference building, the damage limit state is mainly governed by the in-plane behavior, while the collapse limit state by out-of-plane mechanisms. Moreover, the higher the connection level between adjacent structural units, the higher the interaction between in-plane and out-of-plane mechanisms at the collapse limit state.",Seismic fragility assessment of existing masonry buildings in aggregate,2021,Buildings in aggregate; Unreinforced masonry; Seismic assessment; Fragility curves; Non-linear dynamic analysis; Unit interactions; In-plane response; Out-of-plane mechanisms,PERFORMANCE-BASED ASSESSMENT; VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; FLOOR SPECTRA; CENTERS; UNCERTAINTY; CAPACITY; STRENGTH; ABRUZZI; AREAS; MODEL,1,1
13366,"In this study, a simplified approach for the analytical development of fragility curves of high-rise RC buildings is presented. It is based on an approximate modal decomposition procedure known as the Uncoupled Modal Response History Analysis (UMRHA). Using an example of a 55-story case study building, the fragility relationships are developed using the presented approach. Fifteen earthquake ground motions (categorized into 3 groups corresponding to combinations of small or large magnitude and source-to-site distances) are considered for this example. These ground motion histories are scaled for 3 intensity measures (peak ground acceleration, spectral acceleration at 0.2 s and spectral acceleration at 1 s) varying from 0.25 to 2 g. The presented approach resulted in a significant reduction of computational time compared to the detailed Nonlinear Response History Analysis (NLRHA) procedure, and can be applied to assess the seismic vulnerability of complex-natured, higher mode-dominating tall reinforced concrete buildings. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.",Seismic fragility assessment of reinforced concrete high-rise buildings using the uncoupled modal response history analysis (UMRHA),2019,Fragility relationships; High-rise RC buildings; NLRHA; Seismic risk assessment; UMRHA,None,1,1
13373,"This study presents the steel fragility curves and performance curves of industrial buildings of different geometries. The fragility curves were obtained for different building geometries, and the performance curves were developed based on lateral load, which is affected by the geometry of the building. Three records of far-field ground motion were used for incremental dynamic analysis (IDA), and the design lateral loads for pushover analysis (POA). All designs were based on British Standard (BS 5950); however, Eurocode 8 was preferred for seismic consideration in the analysis because BS 5950 does not specify any seismic provision. The five levels of performance stated by FEMA-273, namely, operational phase, immediate occupancy, damage control, life safety, and collapse prevention (CP) were used as main guidelines for evaluating structural performance. For POA, Model 2 had highest base shear, followed by Model 1 and Model 3, even though Model 2 has a smaller structure compared with Model 3. Meanwhile, the fragility curves showed that the probability of reaching or exceeding the CP level of Model 2 is the highest, followed by that of Models 1 and 3. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.",Seismic Fragility Curves of Industrial Buildings by Using Nonlinear Analysis,2017,None,Buildings; Environmental engineering; Geometry; Nonlinear analysis; Office buildings; Seismology; Structural analysis; Collapse prevention; Different geometry; Far-field ground motion; Incremental dynamic analysis; Industrial buildings; Push-over analysis; Seismic fragility curves; Structural performance; Structural design,1,1
13375,"Recent natural disaster events have caused damage to structures and led to loss of lives. Steel structure industrial building is one of the important structures that needs to be examined as these structures can have huge impact on the surrounding areas. Therefore, this study presents the fragility curves and performance curves of steel structure industrial building under earthquake loading. The structure consisted of beam, column, and bracing were modelled using three dimensional finite element modelling. The fragility curves were obtained for the structure, and the performance curves were developed based on lateral load, which was affected by the geometry of the building. Three records of far-field ground motion and three records of local ground motion were used for incremental dynamic analysis (IDA). The five levels of performance stated by FEMA-273, namely, operational phase (OP), immediate occupancy (IO), damage control (DC), life safety (LS), and collapse prevention (CP) were used as main guidelines to evaluate the structural performance. Results showed that, probability damage for operational phase, OP started at 0.19g and 5% of the structure analysed are expected to have immediate occupancy IO, indicating minor cracks to the structure at 0.4g PGA. Moreover, the performance response of the structure to the earthquake was obtained from the study. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Seismic fragility curves of steel structure industrial building using IDA method,2020,None,Earthquakes; Office buildings; Steel structures; Structural analysis; Collapse prevention; Earthquake loadings; Far-field ground motion; Incremental dynamic analysis; Industrial buildings; Seismic fragility curves; Structural performance; Three dimensional finite elements; Disasters,1,1
13376,"Fragility curves are useful tools for the probabilistic assessment of the seismic performance of buildings. Nonlinear structural analyses with uncertainties in load and resistance are required to develop fragility curves. A statistically sufficient number of earthquake ground motion records should ideally be obtained from past records of the region of interest to have a satisfying fragility curve. However, the number of available earthquake records in many seismically active zones is limited. In such a situation, use of the synthetic ground motions is an accepted alternative for fragility analyses of buildings. This paper compares the seismic fragility curves obtained from synthetic and natural ground motion records. It is found that synthetic ground motions result in conservative fragility curves with lesser dispersion in drift demand when compared with natural recorded ground motions. © 2018 Ingenta.",Seismic fragility curves using natural and synthetic ground motions,2017,Dispersion; Fragility curve; Performance level; Synthetic ground motion; Uncertainty,Dispersion (waves); Dispersions; Image segmentation; Seismic waves; Structural analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Earthquake ground motions; Fragility curves; Nonlinear structural analysis; Performance level; Probabilistic assessments; Seismically active zones; Synthetic ground motions; Uncertainty; Earthquakes,1,1

Therefore, assessing its effects on structural performance has become a fundamental issue in seismic engineering.

In order to reproduce the nonlinear cyclic behavior (dilation tendency and the increase in cyclic shear strength) due to liquefaction, nonlinear hysteretic materials and advanced plasticity models were applied.

13383,"Malawi is an earthquake-prone country that lies within the East African Rift. A large proportion of its population lives in non-engineered single-storey constructions made of clay bricks and low-strength mortar. Walls are typically single-skin and often lack adequate wall-to-wall connections, leaving them vulnerable to seismic actions. This work reports a comprehensive study on the seismic fragility of unreinforced masonry buildings of the Malawi housing stock. The probability of exceeding different levels of in-plane/out-of-plane damage is estimated by considering the aleatory and epistemic uncertainties of the problem. Inter-building and intra-building variability are accounted for by adopting material test results and building survey data collected in Malawi. The in-plane capacity of building walls is calculated through a finite element model that considers the orthotropic properties of masonry. The out-of-plane capacity is computed using an analytical solution, developed for walls in one way bending. In addition, record-to-record variability is considered. The new country-specific fragility models result more conservative that global estimates, which reflects the high vulnerability of Malawian masonry buildings. These fragilities can be integrated into catastrophe modelling platforms for earthquake risk assessment in Malawi and in the wider East African region. © 2021 The Author(s)",Seismic fragility models for typical non-engineered URM residential buildings in Malawi,2021,Earthquake vulnerability; Fragility curves; In-plane damage; Malawi; Masonry panel test data; Orthotropic model; Out-of-plane damage; Residential buildings; Unreinforced masonry,None,1,1
13388,"Seismic fragility of lightly reinforced concrete frames with masonry infills is assessed through numerical simulations considering uncertainty in ground motion and building materials. To achieve this aim, a numerical model of the components is developed, a rational approach to proportion and locate individual struts in the equivalent three-strut model is proposed, and an explicit nonlinear column shear response model accounting for the infill-column interaction and soft-story mechanism is employed. The proposed numerical model is used to (1) generate probabilistic seismic demand models accounting for a wide range of ground motion intensities with different frequency content and (2) determine limit state models obtained from nonlinear pushover analysis and incremental dynamic analysis. Using the demand and limit state model, fragility curves for the masonry-infilled frames are developed to investigate the impact of various infill properties on the frame vulnerability. It is observed that the beneficial effect of the masonry infill diminishes at more severe limit states because of the interaction with the boundary frame. In some cases, this effect almost vanishes or switches to an adverse effect beyond a threshold of ground motion intensities. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Seismic fragility of lightly reinforced concrete frames with masonry infills,2015,Equivalent strut model; Infill-column interaction; Limit state model; Masonry-infilled reinforced concrete frame; Probabilistic seismic demand model; Seismic fragility,Concretes; Motion analysis; Numerical models; Offshore pipelines; Reinforced concrete; Seismology; Structural analysis; Struts; Uncertainty analysis; Equivalent struts; Infill-column interaction; Limit state model; Probabilistic seismic demand models; Reinforced concrete frames; Seismic fragility; Masonry materials; column; construction material; dynamic analysis; ground motion; infill; numerical model; probability; reinforced concrete; seismic response,1,1
13389,"Seismic vulnerability of low-ductile reinforced concrete (RC) frames which have not been designed for earthquake loads has been a concern for countries with low-to-medium seismicity like Malaysia. These types of structures represent the majority of existing buildings in Malaysia and their safety level is of interest for authorities to plan for their retrofit. This study is conducted to assess the vulnerability of low-ductile reinforced concrete frame in Malaysia when subjected earthquake records through the development of seismic fragility curves. Three types of structural models were designed for gravity and lateral loads based on the common practices in Malaysia which included RC frames with three, six, and nine stories. The structures were analyzed using incremental dynamic analysis (IDA). In addition, pushover analysis was used to determine inter-story drift demands. The earthquake records were divided into three groups based on their peak ground acceleration (PGA) to peak ground velocity (PGV) ratios. Three structural performance levels namely immediate occupancy (IO), life safety (LS), and collapse prevention (CP) were considered for the selected frames. The results showed that records with the low PGA/PGV ratios that represented far-field earthquakes imposed the highest level of damage to the low-ductile RC frames. It was observed that the probability of seismic induced damage increased as the height of structures increased. The three story RC frame showed brittle failure mechanism when subjected to employed earthquake records. The probability of exceeding CP level under far-field records and the PGA of 0.2g was more than 50% for three and nine story RC frames. It was concluded that three and nine stories RC frames constructed in the East Malaysia did not satisfy the no-collapse requirements and needed to be retrofitted. © IAEME Publication.",Seismic fragility of low ductile reinforced concrete frame in malaysia,2018,Incremental dynamic analysis; Non-ductile reinforced concrete frame; Seismic fragility curves; Seismic performance level; Vulnerability assessment,None,1,1
13391,"Typical steel moment-resisting frames (MRF) of six-storey buildings in Vancouver and Montreal were designed for three different provisions of the National Building Code of Canada (1960s, 1980s, and 2010). Numerical models were developed in OpenSees to understand the seismic performance of the structures. These models accounted for strength and stiffness degradation through appropriate representations of the beam-column connection behaviours, which were calibrated against experimental results available in the literature. The behaviour of the buildings was evaluated through pushover and nonlinear time history analyses. The pushover analysis results showed that the 1960s and 2010 steel MRFs of both cities exhibited strong-column-weak-beam failure mode. The 1980s steel MRFs of both cities showed soft-storey mechanism. Fragility curves were developed for the steel MRFs based on the seismic demands evaluated using nonlinear time history analyses, which can be used for regional seismic impact assessment studies in the future. © 2015, National Research Council of Canada, All Rights Reserved.","Seismic fragility of steel moment-resisting frames in vancouver and montreal designed in the 1960s, 1980s, and 2010",2015,Seismic fragility analysis; Steel moment-resisting frames,Building codes; Earthquake resistance; Seismology; Steel beams and girders; Structural analysis; Beam - column connection; National Building Code of Canada; Nonlinear time history analysis; Seismic fragility analysis; Seismic Performance; Steel moment resisting frame; Strength and stiffness; Strong column weak beam; Structural frames; building code; column; failure analysis; hazard assessment; historical record; numerical model; seismic response; steel structure; British Columbia; Canada; Montreal; Quebec [Canada]; Vancouver [British Columbia],1,1
13449,"Unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings are the most common building typology in the rural and urban areas of Northeast India. These URM buildings suffered substantial damage during earthquakes. In this context, the paper makes an effort to assess the vulnerability of URM buildings of this region through fragility analysis. Four representative URM buildings, consisting of single- and double-storey, have been selected from a group of buildings in the Northeastern part of India based on a suitable statistical parameter to reflect the commonly constructed building typology. Following the equivalent frame modelling approach, each building has been modelled with varying material properties, and thus, a total of 60 building models have been developed. Non-linear static analysis is performed for all the buildings to obtain the probability distribution function (pdf) of the damage states based on the capacity curve parameters. Inelastic displacement demands have been calculated for all the buildings based on the expressions given in FEMA 440 along with the response spectrum of Indian seismic code, IS 1893 Part I. Fragility curves are then derived from the complementary cumulative distribution function (cdf) of displacement demand and pdf of damage states. It is seen that there is a very high probability of suffering major to complete damage for URM buildings subjected to a peak ground acceleration of 0.18 g. Furthermore, derived fragility curves give reasonable predictions of observed post-earthquake building damage and can be used for the earthquake risk assessment of the same building typology of this Northeastern region of India. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.",Seismic vulnerability assessment of low-rise unreinforced masonry buildings in Northeast India considering variability of material properties,2021,Capacity curve; Damage states; Fragility curves; Seismic demand; URM building; Vulnerability assessment,None,1,1

13478,"Wave action during storm surge is a common cause of building damage and therefore a critical consideration when estimating structural vulnerability and mapping flood risk. Traditional depth-damage curves, however, relate building vulnerability solely to inundation depth and therefore neglect an important damage mechanism. Similarly, flood mapping studies typically emphasize expected inundation rather than wave conditions. In this study, we consider the impact of wave effects on vulnerability estimation and flood mapping using a pair of hydrodynamic models (ADCIRC + SWAN and BOUSS1D) to simulate inland storm surge flooding. The models are used to simulate flooding in a heavily impacted coastal community (Ortley Beach, New Jersey) during Hurricane Sandy (2012) and to estimate inland hazard parameters characterizing inundation, wave and velocity effects. To quantify structural vulnerability, fragility curves are developed by statistically relating the simulated hazard parameters to surveyed building damage. The results indicate that dynamic hazard characteristics such as significant wave height are the dominant predictors of severe structural damage. The flood simulation is also used to map the variation of surge and wave effects in the community. Comparing this analysis to flood zones delineated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map reveals severe wave action and building damage in a significant portion of the community deemed least exposed to flood impact. It is suspected that this misrepresentation of risk resulted from overconfidence in the performance of the community’s frontal dune under severe surge and wave actions. © 2017, The Author(s).",Simulating storm surge waves for structural vulnerability estimation and flood hazard mapping,2017,FEMA; FIRM; Flood mapping; Storm surge; Structural vulnerability; Waves,flood damage; flooding; hazard assessment; hydrodynamics; mapping method; modeling; significant wave height; storm surge; vulnerability; wave action; New Jersey; Ortley Beach; United States,1,1
13482,"Seismic fragility of a 5-storey regular shear wall building was derived through nonlinear dynamic analysis and the effect of site specific record selection and direction of applied load were investigated. Two sets of twenty synthetic earthquake records compatible with western and eastern Canadian seismicity are applied to the structural model. Fragility curves of the building were developed having spectral acceleration at the fundamental period of the structure and peak ground acceleration as seismic intensity measures. The results indicated that fragility curves are less sensitive to record selection when spectral acceleration is chosen as the seismic intensity measure, as this parameter provides a normalized format of hazard intensity. On the other hand, when peak ground acceleration is chosen as seismic intensity indicator, significant change is observed in fragility curves derived for sites with different seismicity characteristics. Numerical simulation of the building was further analyzed under western seismic records applied at an angle of 45 degree and the results of dynamic analysis and fragility curves are compared to the case that records are applied parallel to one of the principle directions. Based on the result, applying bidirectional load would cause a delay in entering nonlinear range of behaviour for the structure and therefore is not a conservative approach at lower levels of seismic intensity. © 6th International Conference on Engineering Mechanics and Materials 2017.

13524,"Flood risk management generally relies on economic assessments performed by using flood loss models of different complexity, ranging from simple univariable models to more complex multivariable models. The latter account for a large number of hazard, exposure and vulnerability factors, being potentially more robust when extensive input information is available. We collected a comprehensive data set related to three recent major flood events in northern Italy (Adda 2002, Bacchiglione 2010 and Secchia 2014), including flood hazard features (depth, velocity and duration), building characteristics (size, type, quality, economic value) and reported losses. The objective of this study is to compare the performances of expert-based and empirical (both uni- and multivariable) damage models for estimating the potential economic costs of flood events to residential buildings. The performances of four literature flood damage models of different natures and complexities are compared with those of univariable, bivariable and multivariable models trained and tested by using empirical records from Italy. The uni- and bivariable models are developed by using linear, logarithmic and square root regression, whereas multivariable models are based on two machine-learning techniques: random forest and artificial neural networks. Results provide important insights about the choice of the damage modelling approach for operational disaster risk management. Our findings suggest that multivariable models have better potential for producing reliable damage estimates when extensive ancillary data for flood event characterisation are available, while univariable models can be adequate if data are scarce. The analysis also highlights that expert-based synthetic models are likely better suited for transferability to other areas compared to empirically based flood damage models. © Author(s) 2019.

13529,"In this study, the effect of local site conditions (site class and site amplifications) and structural variability are investigated on fragility functions of typical building structures. The study area is chosen as Eastern Turkey. The fragility functions are developed using site-specific uniform hazard spectrum (UHS). The site-specific UHS is obtained based on simulated ground motions. The implementation of ground motion simulation into seismic hazard assessment has the advantage of investigating detailed local site effects. The typical residential buildings in Erzincan are represented by equivalent single degree of freedom systems (ESDOFs). Predictive equations are accomplished for structural seismic demands of ESDOFs to derive fragility functions in a straightforward manner. To study the sensitivity of fragility curves to site class, two sites on soft and stiff soil are taken into account. Two alternative site amplification functions known as generic and theoretical site amplifications are examined for these two sites. The reinforced concrete frames located on soft soil display larger fragilities than those on stiff soil. Theoretical site amplification mostly leads to larger fragilities than generic site amplification more evidently for reinforced concrete buildings. Additionally, structural variability of ESDOFs is generally observed to increase the fragility especially for rigid structural models. © 2018 Techno-Press, Ltd.",The effect of structural variability and local site conditions on building fragility functions,2018,Fragility functions; Ground motion simulation; Site effects,Concrete buildings; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Hazards; Reinforced concrete; Soils; Fragility function; Ground-motion simulation; Reinforced concrete frames; Seismic hazard assessment; Single degree of freedom systems; Site amplification functions; Site effects; Uniform hazard spectrums; Earthquake effects,1,1
13533,"The present paper presents an integrated model for the ex-ante evaluation of flood damages based on “stage damages curve” as a decision support tool for public and private authorities in the sustainable management of risk areas. The proposed model aims to estimate the damage both at a micro-scale and on an extended area. In particular, the dynamics of flooding in flood areas and their effects on the degree of vulnerability of the different types of buildings are considered. The proposed model, already experimented in different territorial contexts, has been applied to the case of the Senigallia flood, which took place in 2014. The first results show that the approach based on damage curves applied to different types of exposed goods at a micro-scale can reliably estimate the damages to buildings. In contrast, the ex-ante estimation of indirect damages is still uncertain due to the difficulty of evaluating, according to reliable criteria, unique assets such as intangibles and cultural and environmental assets. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.",The ex-ante evaluation of flood damages for a sustainable risk management,2019,Ex-ante evaluation; Flood damages; Integrated model; Stage damages curves,Decision support systems; Dynamics; Flood damage; Risk management; Damage curves; Decision support tools; Ex ante evaluation; Flood areas; Integrated modeling; Micro-scale; Risk areas; Sustainable management; Sustainable development,1,1
13544,"The increased availability of post-tsunami damage data over the past decade has led to a growing inventory of empirical vulnerability functions that model the damage response of buildings to tsunamis. At present, these functions are highly varied with respect to the building typologies and damage states that they represent, making it difficult to apply them effectively in tsunami vulnerability and loss assessments. This paper provides a detailed review of the methods that have been used to develop empirical vulnerability functions and identifies the key factors that are contributing to the variation seen in existing functions. Categorisation and direct comparison of existing functions show that the variation in previous work is due to significant differences in the accuracy of the hazard assessment techniques that are used, inconsistent and poorly defined damage state and building typology classification systems, the use of error-prone and incorrectly applied statistical methods and the use of post-event data that is not representative of the building damage occurring in study areas. As a result of these findings, recommendations for future work include: (1) using more accurate hazard assessment methods; (2) applying more consistent damage state classification methodologies; (3) implementing more precise building typology classification systems; and (4) ensuring that the tsunami-impacted buildings used to generate vulnerability functions are representative of the full damage and hazard range occurring in impacted areas. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",The use of empirical vulnerability functions to assess the response of buildings to tsunami impact: Comparative review and summary of best practice,2015,Building vulnerability; Catastrophe modelling; Fragility curve; Probabilistic; Tsunami damage; Vulnerability function,building; catastrophic event; comparative study; damage; empirical analysis; hazard assessment; probability; tsunami; vulnerability,1,1
13552,"Earthquakes, despite being a mostly natural phenomenon, may also be induced by a wide range of anthropogenic activities such as mining, fluid injection and extraction, hydraulic fracturing and geothermal reservoir processes. In recent years, the occurrence of induced and triggered seismicity and its potential impact on the built environment have heightened both public concern and regulatory scrutiny, motivating the need for an integrated risk management framework. Non-standard monitoring approaches provide valuable tools for mitigating the risk associated with earthquakes. These solutions include the use of advanced sensors and the implementation of performance-based rapid response systems for infrastructure, as well as monitoring the structural response of buildings and infrastructure in real time. Such technical solutions can be further used for validating damage forecasts determined by probabilistic approaches. The goal of this study is to establish a performance-driven monitoring system for induced seismicity. For this purpose, it is necessary to integrate analytical fragility curves in real time. These fragility curves can be derived by simplified vulnerability models that require input obtained from advanced exposure-monitoring techniques. Considering the case of induced seismicity, this also requires the expected damage to refer to non-structural components. Hence, the derived fragility curves are based on the non-structural damage criteria of typical residences. Therefore, a new approach is presented for defining analytical fragility curves of traditional or historic masonry structures, which can be found in large numbers near the geothermal platforms considered in this work. © 2018, The Author(s).",Toward performance-driven seismic risk monitoring for geothermal platforms: development of ad hoc fragility curves,2018,Fragility curve; Induced seismicity; Non-standard monitoring; Non-structural components; On-site monitoring system,Earthquakes; Geothermal fields; Induced Seismicity; Real time systems; Risk management; Structural analysis; Anthropogenic activity; Fragility curves; Integrated risk management; Non-structural components; Non-structural damage; On-site monitoring system; Probabilistic approaches; Vulnerability models; Monitoring; geothermal system; induced seismicity; monitoring system; vulnerability,1,1
13557,"The presence of capillary pressure in unsaturated soils may, under certain circumstances, significantly affect the stability of a slope and the safety of a structure standing in the vicinity of its crest. More specifically, the change in saturation induced by a rainfall event may directly influence the value of apparent soil cohesion potentially resulting in excessive permanent slope displacements and subsequent structural damages for the structure standing on it. Under these considerations, this study aims at the vulnerability assessment of typical reinforced concrete (RC) buildings on precarious slopes subjected to rainfall induced landslide hazard. The proposed methodology is based on a two-step numerical analysis procedure. First, the permanent absolute and differential ground displacement time histories at the assumed building location within the landslide zone are evaluated performing coupled mechanical-flow analysis of a generic initially unsaturated natural slope configuration considering the employment of different rainfall events of increased intensity at the surface of the slope model. Different soil properties of the surface layer are considered to represent silty and soft clayey soil material. Appropriate analytical relationships between the rainfall intensity and its duration and the computed permanent displacements are extracted. Then, a series of nonlinear static time history analyses are performed for reference low and mid-rise, low-code RC bare and infilled frame buildings located next to the slope's crest to assess their fragility. The buildings’ response assessed using appropriate engineering demand parameters (EDPs) to account for both the global flexural and local shear demand are statistically correlated with predefined damage limit states to construct the fragility functions. To facilitate the applicability of the proposed methodology within a quantitative landslide risk assessment framework, vulnerability curves are finally developed to quantify the expected direct losses in normalised cost terms. © 2021",Towards the vulnerability assessment of low-code RC frame buildings at precarious slopes subjected to rainfall induced landslide hazard,2021,Coupled slope mechanical-flow analysis; Fragility curves; Rainfall induced landslide hazard; Reinforced concrete buildings; Slope displacement; Structural damage,None,0,1
13562,"From the last large seismic movements generated in the Pacific Ocean, it has been demonstrated that tsunamis have a high potential of destruction of buildings on the coasts. In that sense, although along the Pacific Colombian coast several earthquakes that have generated tsunami were reported during the last century, there are no local data to quantify the physical damage that future events could produce on nearby cities. For the purpose of establishing tools to increase the risk management capabilities along the Colombian-Ecuadorian Pacific Coast, this paper summarizes a research aimed to describe a new integrated methodology to obtain fragility curves for local buildings at risk of a tsunami. This task was accomplished using computational nonlinear structural analysis, combined with a Monte Carlo statistical algorithm to obtain numerical probabilistic fragility curves. The structural capacity of buildings was obtained from nonlinear structural simulations using the finite element method, to calculate later the damage of each building. Two different damage models to estimate the probability of damage were tested in order to evaluate the one that better represents the structural behavior of buildings, in which the tsunami was considered in the structural model as forces scattered to different heights, thus representing different flow depths. As a result, a methodology was developed to calculate theoretical probabilistic fragility curves for the typical structures found in the Colombian Pacific coast, although this methodology could be expanded to any structural system located in any region around the world. As an illustrative example, the methodology proposed in this research was applied to a typical reinforced concrete building, obtained from a previous work in which all the Tumaco city buildings were characterized according to their structural features. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Tsunami analytical fragility curves for the Colombian Pacific coast: A reinforced concrete building example,2019,Colombian Pacific coast; Damage models; Fragility curves; Risk; Structural capacity; Tsunamis,Concrete buildings; Reinforced concrete; Risk management; Risks; Damage model; Fragility curves; Integrated methodology; Management capabilities; Nonlinear structural analysis; Pacific coasts; Structural capacities; Structural simulations; Tsunamis; analytical framework; building; concrete structure; damage; reinforced concrete; risk assessment; structural analysis; structural response; tsunami; Colombia; Pacific Coast [Colombia]; Pacific Coast [South America],1,1
13564,"The extensive loss of human lives and building damage sustained during past tsunamis drove development of the first tsunami risk assessment in Israel. Although past tsunamis have occurred along the eastern Mediterranean coasts, no data is available for empirical hazard and risk analysis. Thus, our assessment focused on a simulated tsunami generated by an Mw 8.2 earthquake along the eastern Cypriot Arc (about 200 km NW of Haifa) in Bat Galim, the most vulnerable neighborhood in the city of Haifa, situated along the Mediterranean coast in northern Israel. This tsunami event represents the worst-case scenario threatening Bat Galim. Exposure data were taken from the National Archives of the Survey of Israel and was verified with a field survey. Two approaches were taken to derive the most appropriate vulnerability models for the study: first, already published Damage Criteria (DC) were developed based on information from past tsunami events around the world; second, damage functions were applied using the Hazus Tsunami Model (HTM), a multi-parameter loss estimation tool built using detailed engineering knowledge. Risk was considered the product of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. Following several parametric studies and sensitivity tests, we produced loss assessment results from the two most realistic model outcomes and arrived at conclusions meaningful for tsunami preparedness in northern Israel. Most importantly, we note that the loss of life far surpasses building damage. Increasing community preparedness is the simplest and most cost-effective way to significantly reduce the risk of casualties during a tsunami. We also note that upgrading the seismic design of existing structures according to required standards in Israel will decrease vulnerability to tsunamis and expand possibilities for vertical evacuation. We discuss the accuracy and reliability of our analysis and demonstrate that a simple DC approach is useful for preliminary investigation in cases of limited data. The HTM however, requires detailed preparation and data inputs but produces more realistic loss estimates. These insights may aid others during future implementation of tsunami loss modeling in threatened coastal communities.","Tsunami loss assessment based on Hazus approach - The Bat Galim, Israel, case study",2021,Building vulnerability; Fragility curves; HAZUS; Mediterranean coast; Risk; Tsunami loss,VULNERABILITY; HAZARD; BUILDINGS; RISK; SEISMOTECTONICS; DEFORMATION; DEBRIS; IMPACT; FAULT; FIELD,1,1
13599,"The use of fragility curves for the assessment of seismic losses is in increasing demand, both for pre-earthquake disaster planning as well as post-earthquake recovery and retrofitting programs. Fragility curves; important components of accurate risk assessment are functions that describe the probability of failure, conditioned on the full range of loads to which a system might be exposed. In general fragility curves provide estimates for the probabilities of a structure reaching/ exceeding limiting deformation at given levels of ground shaking or it is a plot of the computed probability (deflection) Vs. Ground motion parameter. The scope of the proposed research is to develop fragility curves as a tool to develop suitable measures that can help in estimating the losses for the structures, similar to the case study building and thus to develop the same as an important tool in earthquake engineering mainly for urban risk reduction. The objective of the proposed study is the reliability assessment of the case study building to earthquake loadings through the development of fragility curves. The vulnerability of the structure is expressed with the development of fragility curves, which provides the probability of exceeding a prescribed level of damage for a wide range of ground motion intensities. Primary task is to identify a case study structure for which fragility curves are not developed yet and which could effectively represent the structural viability of present and future buildings. It is based on a concept that similar type of structures (structural typology) will have same probability of a given damage state for given earthquake intensity. Hence effective methods to develop fragility curves for representative buildings are very vital in earthquake engineering. We propose to develop fragility curves for a building with flat-slabs and shear wall system which effectively represents recent high rise buildings particularly in GCC countries. © Research India Publications.",Vulnerability assessment using fragility curves,2017,Earthquake engineering; Earthquake engineering; Flat slab structures; Fragility curves; Reliability analysis; Shear wall system,None,1,1

12505,"In this paper, a novel predictive model for the seismic vulnerability assessment of old Italian minor historical centres is presented. The proposed methodology is based on the use of eight seismic parameters, which can be easily extracted from the CARTIS form, a new tool for collecting building inventories at the regional scale, promoted by the Italian Civil Protection. The proposed method takes inspiration from a 14 parameters-based empirical method calibrated by the authors after the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake and validated also on the base of the damage scenarios of the 2016 Central Italy earthquake. However, with respect to the original method, the applied procedure is properly modified in order to provide the same results even if the type amd the number of input information is different. In the first part of the paper, the CARTIS form is presented. Then the proposed methodology is shown and the eight seismic parameters used for its application are discussed. Finally, in order to show the feasibility of the method, it is applied to the case study of Grottazzolina, a small town located in the administrative region of Marche, in Italy, for which fragility curves are provided as a useful tool for predicting the damage scenarios that could potentially occur under different earthquake intensities.

12506,"The study focuses on the probabilistic seismic risk assessment of earthquake prone old urban centers. This issue becomes even more complex if the considered area is a highly populated, cultural or commercial center. Hence it is an important task to estimate regional earthquake losses and to develop strategies for earthquake mitigation through seismic risk prioritization among such vulnerable populated old urban areas. For this purpose, a sub-district with six neighborhoods in Beyoglu, Istanbul has been selected as the study area, which is located in a high-seismicity region. This is one of the most attractive cultural places in the city as well as a commercial center with a high population. Building stock is dense and composed of many old and deficient buildings located within close vicinity of active faults. For risk assessment, site-specific hazard curves are obtained first. Then reinforced concrete and masonry buildings in the region are classified by using the results of a recent walk down survey data and fragility curve sets that reflect local structural characteristics of the buildings in the area are attained to each class. In the last step, probabilistic seismic risk assessment approach is utilized to obtain the estimated damage state distributions at the considered neighborhoods for a 50-year time interval. The results reveal the urgency in order to take precautions to mitigate earthquake losses in vulnerable old urban centers. This study is deemed to propose a potential approach by carrying out site-specific hazard, vulnerability and risk assessments as an assistance to risk mitigation efforts. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",A case study for probabilistic seismic risk assessment of earthquake-prone old urban centers,2021,Fragility curves; Istanbul; Old urban center; Probabilistic approach; Risk assessment; Seismic hazard,None,0,1
12509,"A recently introduced structural steel braced frame known as the strongback system (SBS) is a hybrid of a conventional bracing system and an essentially elastic vertical truss. This elastic backbone is designed to distribute seismic demands uniformly over the height of the building and consequently prevent damage concentration. Recent studies on developing design procedures for SBSs revealed that prescriptive code-based methods are inadequate to estimate their seismic demands, and they cannot ensure to fulfill the performance objectives properly. Here, to properly evaluate the seismic behavior of a wide variety of the practical configurations of SBS, a comprehensive parametric study is carried out on elastic backbone configuration, rigidity, and height. To this end, a series of different SBS archetypes are designed using a direct performance-based method, and the fulfillment of the performance targets is probabilistically assessed. Their over-strength factors, ductility ratios, and collapse fragility curves are compared together and with the performance of structures using conventional system and design method. Results indicate that the archetypes with the brace intersection point of two-third of the length of the beam, namely X-2/3 configuration, have shown the largest ductility ratio and lowest collapse probability, while the archetypes with chevron configuration have shown the smallest ductility ratio and highest collapse probability. Further, by increasing the rigidity of the vertical backbone, ductility ratio and the median spectral acceleration at collapse level are improved, and SBS archetypes tended to have uniform story drift distribution patterns. Applying the direct performance-based method in six-story structures reduces the story drift ratios of SBS up to 30%. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",A comparative performance-based seismic assessment of strongback steel braced frames,2021,Collapse fragility curves; Elastic truss; Performance-based seismic design; Strongback system; Yield frequency spectra,Building materials; Ductility; Rigid structures; Rigidity; Seismic design; Seismology; Steel construction; Structural frames; Collapse fragility curve; Collapse probabilities; Ductility ratio; Elastic truss; Performance based method; Performance based seismic design; Seismic demands; Steel braced frames; Strongback system; Yield frequency spectrum; Trusses,0,1
12513,"Different sources of uncertainties contribute to the collapse and safety assessment of structures. In this paper, impact of construction quality (CQ) is considered in developing analytical collapse fragility curves for moment resisting steel frames. Furthermore, the interaction of this source of uncertainty with epistemic uncertainty inherent in modeling parameters, due to lack of knowledge and inaccuracy of predictor equations, is investigated. Beam strength, column strength, beam ductility, and column ductility meta-variables are defined as modeling parameters which are being suffered by informal uncertainty. Quadratic equations for the mean and the standard deviation of collapse fragility curves are derived by utilizing response surfaces, which are interpolated to analytically-derived values considering realizations for modeling variables and for various levels of construction quality. To the best of the authors' knowledge, interaction of modeling and CQ uncertainty in analytical collapse fragility curve has not been considered in previous investigations. A fuzzy rule-based method is applied to employ the effects of uncertainty due to CQ. Using Monte Carlo simulation for the modeling variables and the construction quality index, and subsequently computing response surface coefficients via a fuzzy inference system, and finally deriving collapse fragility curve parameters through response surfaces, result in collapse fragility curves of structures. In developing these curves, different sources of uncertainties are involved, ranging from lexical to informal and stochastic types. It is concluded that neglecting the effects of these sources leads to the underestimation of collapse fragility probability. This shows the importance of considering modeling and construction quality uncertainty effects on collapse fragility curves. It is shown that for a sample moment resisting steel frame collapse probability is increased 53% and 60% for 10% and 2% probability of exceedance in 50 years seismic hazard levels, respectively, while interaction of CQ and modeling uncertainties are considered in comparison with neglecting them. Otherwise, if only modeling uncertainty is involved, this increment is evaluated at 42% and 16%, respectively for the aforementioned probabilities of exceedance.",A comprehensive collapse fragility assessment of moment resisting steel frames considering various sources of uncertainties,2016,collapse fragility curves; uncertainty sources; fuzzy inference system; moment resisting steel structures; incremental dynamic analysis; response surface method,REINFORCED-CONCRETE BUILDINGS; FUZZY; PERFORMANCE; CURVES; RISK,0,1
12519,"In certain coastal areas across the globe, tsunamis pose a great threat to buildings, infrastructure and people's lives. The prevailing approaches for assessing building damage are based on probabilistic analysis. This paper introduces a new deterministic approach to assess large-scale building damage through quantifying lateral loading on structures induced by tsunami waves. A depth-averaged hydrodynamic model is adopted to simulate tsunami propagation and inundation and calculate the induced pressures and forces on structures. The model solves the 2D nonlinear shallow water equations (SWEs) using a finite volume shock-capturing numerical scheme and is implemented on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to achieve high-performance computing for large-scale applications. A new model component is included to calculate pressures and forces using the predicted flow variables, i.e. water depth and velocities. The resulting maximum tsunami forces are combined with a lateral force resisting system on each building to estimate damage states. This new approach is developed by taking advantages of a similar damage assessment method and the corresponding coefficients for quantifying earthquake impact on buildings, due to the similarity between the horizontal force systems induced by tsunami waves and earthquake motions. After being successfully validated against three experimental cases related to flow hydrodynamics, pressures and forces, the model is used to simulate a hypothetical 1000-year tsunami event in the City of Seaside, Oregon, USA. The resulting damage states are then classified for each of the urban buildings in the area, taking into account different building types. The predicted results are consistent with those obtained using alternative approaches, confirming the potential of the proposed approach for practical engineering applications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",A deterministic approach for assessing tsunami-induced building damage through quantification of hydrodynamic forces,2019,Building damage assessment; Deterministic methods; Hydrodynamic force; Lateral force resisting system; Tsunami modelling,Buildings; Computer graphics; Earthquakes; Equations of motion; Graphics processing unit; Hydrodynamics; Nonlinear equations; Program processors; Tsunamis; Building damage; Deterministic methods; High performance computing; Hydrodynamic forces; Large-scale applications; Lateral force resisting system; Non-linear shallow water equations; Practical engineering applications; Damage detection; building; damage; finite volume method; hydrodynamic force; loading; numerical model; quantitative analysis; shallow-water equation; tsunami; Oregon; United States,0,1
12529,"The effectiveness of various vibration control strategies has always been a debate among structural engineers. Seismic base isolation systems and passive dampers are recognized as two of the most economical devices which have passive mechanisms in reducing the structural vibration and responses. To this end, comprehensive biaxial shake table testings have been carried out on a building frame with and without a proposed base isolation system. The proposed device has a novel combined isolation mechanism at the structure's base. By different methods of testing, natural frequencies and viscous damping for the frame model with and without the proposed system were identified. Both structures were intensively tested under various earthquake motions, and various structural responses were recorded. The experimental results indicated that the newly proposed system is very effective in controlling the vibration of building structures and can be used to increase the seismic resilience metrics. As a complementary investigation, the incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) was conducted to develop the seismic fragility curves under both near-field and far-field strong ground motions (SGMs). The fragility estimations indicated that the proposed system has a higher collapse margin ratio (CMR) compared to conventional fixed-base frames. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",A hybrid seismic isolation system toward more resilient structures: Shaking table experiment and fragility analysis,2021,Base isolation; Collapse margin; Fragility curve; Hybrid control; Low-damage; Passive damper; Seismic resilience; Shaking table; Steel structure,Structural dynamics; Vibration control; Base isolation systems; Incremental dynamic analysis; Seismic base isolation; Seismic fragility curves; Seismic isolation systems; Shaking table experiment; Strong ground motion; Structural vibrations; Earthquakes,0,1
12530,"The current paper presents the development and seismic assessment of the Smart Hybrid Resilient building (SHR). This novel building is comprised of self-centering dampers in parallel with Pall friction dampers. The design methodology and equations are first introduced with aim of creating the seismic resilience feature in structures. The designed SHR systems have the capability to adjust and control the residual drift of each story (covers the disadvantage of Pall system) in addition to high energy-dissipating capacity (covers the downside of expensive shape memory alloy-based system). Based on FEMA P-58 recommendation, 0.2% and 0.5% drift ratios are considered as the economical residual drift limitations of specimens. Limiting the story residual drift to these thresholds makes the decision of repairing structure after earthquake occurrence more rational rather than rebuilding the new one. In order to the comprehensive assessment of SHR system performance and precision of design equations, some specimens with diverse heights and various consumed shape memory alloy materials are modeled in OpenSees. Afterwards, all the SHR specimens in comparison with purely Self-Center systems are subjected to quasi-static cyclic loading analysis and incremental dynamic analysis.

12537,"Since the current process to achieve the collapse fragility curve in practical applications seems too complicated, also time-consuming to dominant by structure designers, the focus of this study is on introducing of a new approach for establishing collapse fragility curves which requires less analytical effort. To achieve this goal, state-based philosophy (SBP) has been taken into consideration. This theory benefits from some similarities in the nature of every failure process in solid mechanics regardless of its source. In this study these similarities are used intelligently in procedure of formulating new fragility function which has couple of unknown parameters. Next, it will be shown that these parameters can be attained from two different sources: the pushover curves of the structure, some selective damage data from incremental dynamic analysis analyses. Finally a complete form of new collapse fragility function which is called SBP fragility function proposed as a substitute for conventional collapse fragility function.

12544,"Predicting the seismic loss of a building is critical for its resilience. A prediction method for building seismic loss based on the building information model (BIM) and FEMA P-58 is proposed in this study. First, a component-level damage prediction algorithm is designed to establish the mapping from BIM components to the performance groups (PGs) in FEMA P-58, and to predict the component damage using the BIM-based time-history analysis (THA) and the fragility curves of PGs. Subsequently, an ontology-based model considering the deduction rules in the local unit-repair-cost database is created for obtaining exact measurement data of components in a BIM. Meanwhile, a component-level loss prediction algorithm is developed using the measurement data and the unit repair costs corresponding to damage states, by which the predicted seismic losses can agree with the actual situation of the specific region. Finally, a component-level visualization algorithm is designed to display the seismic damage and loss in a virtual reality (VR) environment. A six-story office building in Beijing is used as a pilot test to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.

12552,"In this study, a simplified procedure to predict the maximum inter-story drift demands of mid-rise framed buildings in terms of a spectral-shape-based ground motion intensity measure is proposed. For this aim, the maximum inter-story drift of steel and reinforced concrete (R/C) frames with 4, 6, 8 and 10 stories subjected to several narrow-band ground motions is estimated as a function of the spectral acceleration at first mode of vibration of the structure Sa(T1), which is commonly used in earthquake engineering and seismology, and with the recently developed parameter related to the structural response known as INp. It is observed that the spectral-shape-based intensity measure INp is the parameter best related with the structural response of the selected frames under narrow-band motions. Therefore, a new approach is used to propose equations to compute maximum inter-story drift demands and seismic uncertainty of mid-rise frames as a function of INp. The equations can be used for the rapid seismic assessment and to obtain structural fragility curves of the steel and R/C frame models. The fragility curves obtained with the simplified approach are compared to those obtained with traditional procedure to compute structural fragility.

12563,"The abundance of training data is not guaranteed in various supervised learning applications. One of these situations is the post-earthquake regional damage assessment of buildings. Querying the damage label of each building requires a thorough inspection by experts, and thus, is an expensive task. A practical approach is to sample the most informative buildings in a sequential learning scheme. Active learning methods recommend the most informative cases that are able to maximally reduce the generalization error. The information-theoretic measure of mutual information (MI), which maximizes the expected information gain over the input domain, can be used for informative sampling of a dataset in a pool-based scenario. However, the computational complexity of the standard MI algorithm prevents the utilization of this method on large datasets. A local kernels strategy was proposed to reduce the computational costs, but the adaptability of the kernels to the observed labels was not considered in the original formulation of this strategy. In this article, an adaptive local kernels methodology is developed that enables the conformability of the kernels to the observed output data while enhancing the computational complexity of the standard MI algorithm. The proposed algorithm is developed to work with a Gaussian process regression (GPR) method, where the kernel hyperparameters are updated after each label query using maximum likelihood estimation. In the sequential learning procedure, the updated hyperparameters can be used in the MI kernel matrices to improve the sample suggestion performance. The advantages of the proposed method are demonstrated in a simulation of the 2018 Anchorage, AK, earthquake. It is shown that while the proposed algorithm enables GPR to reach acceptable performance using fewer training data, the computational demand remains lower than the standard local kernels strategy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Adaptive local kernels formulation of mutual information with application to active post-seismic building damage inference,2021,Active learning; Earthquake damage estimation; Gaussian process regression; Mutual information; Regional damage assessment,Artificial intelligence; Computational complexity; Damage detection; Earthquakes; Gaussian distribution; Maximum likelihood estimation; Active Learning; Earthquake damage estimation; Gaussian process regression; Hyper-parameter; Information algorithms; Local kernel; Mutual informations; Regional damage assessment; Sequential learning; Training data; Gaussian noise (electronic),0,1
12566,"Bringing together state-of-the-art high-performance computing, remote sensing and spatial information sciences, we established a real-time tsunami inundation forecasting, damage estimation and mapping system to enhance disaster response.

12568,"A novel approach for structural system optimal design considering life cycle cost is developed. Specifically, a performance-based multi-objective design optimization framework for nonlinear/hysteretic multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) structural systems subject to evolutionary stochastic excitation is formulated. In the core of the stochastic structural analysis component of the proposed framework lies an efficient approximate dimension reduction technique based on the concepts of statistical linearization and of stochastic averaging for determining the non-stationary system response amplitude probability density functions (PDFs); thus, computationally intensive Monte Carlo simulations are circumvented. Note that the approach can readily handle stochastic excitations of arbitrary non-separable evolutionary power spectral density (EPSD) forms that exhibit strong variability in both the intensity and the frequency content. Further, approximate closed-form expressions are derived for the non-stationary inter-story drift ratio amplitude PDFs corresponding to each and every DOF. In this regard, considering appropriately defined damage measures structural system related fragility curves are determined at a low computational cost as well. Finally, the structural system design optimization problem is formulated as a multi-objective one to be solved by a genetic algorithm based approach.

12571,"Deterioration parameters that are commonly used to simulate nonlinear behavior of steel components were mainly calibrated based on the results from experiments on steel beams. Recently, the state of knowledge for deterioration behavior of steel columns has been improved by experimental and analytical studies on the wide-flange steel columns. These deteriorating characteristics are introduced as regression relationships in which the associated uncertainties are represented by the coefficient of variation (COV). Accounting for these uncertainties in estimating collapse fragility curves through the incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) and simulation-based reliability methods is impractical due to the large amount of required computational effort. In this study, two main goals are pursued. The first goal is comprehensive evaluation of the main, interaction, and quadratic effects of the modeling random variables on the collapse capacity of steel structures. The second goal is to propose an efficient approach to create response surface (RS), which in combination with the Monte Carlo (MC) sampling method will be used to incorporate modeling uncertainties into the collapse fragility. This efficiency will be achieved by employing screening design techniques to reduce the amount of analysis required to create a quadratic RS and also endurance time (ET) analysis as an efficient alternative nonlinear dynamic analysis method with less computational time to estimate the structural responses. In order to develop a reliable probabilistic model, the Bayesian model inference approach is applied to account for the uncertainties in the created model. The proposed procedure is performed with both IDA and ET methods on a prototype 5-story steel frame. Results indicate that collapse capacity is highly influenced by the strength modeling variables of beam as well as the ultimate rotation capacity of column components. In addition, ET method by a considerable reduction in the computational costs provides comparable responses with IDA in a probabilistic framework.",An efficient method for incorporating modeling uncertainties into collapse fragility of steel structures,2021,Collapse fragility; Response surface; Monte Carlo sampling; Design of experiments; Endurance time method; Bayesian inferential approach,INCREMENTAL DYNAMIC-ANALYSIS; SEISMIC PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT; ENDURANCE TIME METHOD; DESIGN; RISK; SENSITIVITY; PROBABILITY; BUILDINGS; STRENGTH; IMPACTS,0,1
12577,"The efficiency of post-quake emergency management depends heavily on the speed of seismic damage assessment software, which depends on the evaluation algorithm essentially. Traditional seismic damage assessment models based on sequence algorithms usually need tens of minutes to get visualized results. More efficient computing models for seismic damage assessment are demanded urgently. General parallel evaluation algorithm based on GPU computing framework was investigated by the authors, and an improved seismic damage assessment model for buildings was proposed in this paper. We designed a three-level parallel scheme to accelerate the computing and visualization. At the top level, the earthquake area is divided into smaller regions, such as cities or counties. At the middle level, fundamental geographic data for each region is split into layers by features. At the bottom level, buildings are grouped into several types, which can be processed by GPU cores simultaneously. The developed model can estimate and analyze the seismic damage of buildings and the spatial distribution of victims in earthquake region more rapidly than traditional models. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",An Improved Seismic Damage Assessment Model for Buildings Based on Parallel Algorithms,2019,assessment model; buildings; GPU; parallel algorithm; seismic damage,Bridge components; Buildings; Earthquakes; Environmental engineering; Graphics processing unit; Parallel algorithms; Risk management; Structural analysis; Assessment models; Emergency management; Evaluation algorithm; Parallel evaluation; Seismic damage; Seismic damage assessment; Sequence algorithms; Traditional models; Damage detection,0,1
12578,"Seismic damage assessment is an extraordinary opportunity to evaluate the reliability of vulnerability and risk methodologies applied to historic masonry buildings, giving the possibility of enhancing and optimising mitigation and retrofit strategies. Vulnerability index methodologies are flexible and powerful tools for assessing seismic vulnerability on the urban scale, providing a first screening of the critical issues present in masonry buildings and a possible priority list for the following retrofit operations. Such approaches account for the buildings' different structural characteristics, directly or indirectly influencing their seismic behaviour and measured through different weights and classes finally providing a vulnerability index. In this paper, we show the application of three well-known methodologies to Campi Alto di Norcia's medieval city in Valnerina (Italy) stroke by the earthquakes of 24 August and 30 October 2016. The methodologies' reliability is assessed, based on the observation of real seismic consequences and damages on the masonry buildings, and an optimised methodology is then proposed for the considered case study.","An Improved Seismic Vulnerability Assessment Approach for Historical Urban Centres: The Case Study of Campi Alto di Norcia, Italy",2021,vulnerability index method; damage scenarios; masonry buildings; seismic assessment; structural aggregates,None,0,1
12580,"In recent years, several locations in the United States have been experiencing a significant increase in seismicity that has been attributed to oil and gas production. As oil and natural gas production in the United States continues to increase, it is expected that the seismic hazard in these locations will continue to experience a corresponding upsurge. However, many urban structures in these locations are not designed to withstand these increasing levels of seismicity. Accordingly, it is crucial to develop methodologies that can help us quantify the seismic performance of these structures, establish their risk levels, and identify optimal retrofit strategies that will enhance the seismic resilience of these structures. In this context, structural health monitoring (SHM) plays an important role in understanding the seismic performance of structures. SHM can be used, in conjunction with finite element modelling, to provide a realistic representation of the structural performance during a seismic event. In this paper, a framework for seismic risk assessment of reinforced concrete buildings based on SHM is presented. The framework combines nonlinear finite element modeling and SHM data to establish the seismic fragility profile of the structure. The approach is illustrated on a multistory reinforced concrete structure located on the Oklahoma State University Campus. © 20th Congress of IABSE, New York City 2019: The Evolving Metropolis - Report.

12587,"This study investigates the building damage ratio based on damage survey data of the 2016 Kumamoto, Japan, earthquake. Most of building fragility curves in Japan were developed based on the actual damage data in the 1995 Kobe earthquake. However, already 24 years have passed after this event, and hence it is better to use recent earthquake data in Japan. In this study, the building damage in Uki City, Kumamoto prefecture, was analyzed based on the damage survey data by the local government. The damage ratios of buildings were investigated from the viewpoints of structural material and construction period. As the result, the damage ratio of wooden buildings was found to be larger than those of other structural materials (Reinforced Concrete (RC), Steel (S) and Light-gauge Steel (LS)), and it got higher as the construction period becomes older. The spatial distribution of damaged buildings was further investigated with their locations. The results were compared with the distribution of peak ground velocity values and the fragility curves of wooden buildings for four construction periods were developed.

12590,"Fragility curves have proved to be an efficient tool for the seismic vulnerability assessment of buildings made of stone masonry such as those located in historic districts of Eastern Canadian cities. However, most studies do not take into consideration the case of collapse in the out-of-plane direction. This failure mode may be critical for elements such as chimneys, firewalls, and front walls. This study focuses on the assessment of seismic vulnerability of stone masonry buildings sensitive to out-of-plane failure. A model of out-of-plane capacity showing the degree of damage in terms of displacements was developed as well as a calculation method for displacements in the out-of-plane direction taking into account the filter effect of the building in plane direction.

This is implemented on a medium height reinforced concrete building designed prior to the seismic ductility provisions being added to the ACI code. Focusing on medium height concrete buildings allows the research to be adjusted and applied to a wide range of occupancy types. Pushover analysis was carried out to verify the response of the building is as expected and the modeling is accurate for the shear wall and moment frame systems. This was followed by a non-linear time history analysis to collect column rotation information. Fragility curves are developed to obtain statistical damage ratios under different retrofit methods.

12602,"The Small Island Developing States are characterized by an unstable economy and low-lying, densely populated cities, resulting in a high vulnerability to natural hazards. Flooding affects more people than any other hazard. To limit the consequences of these hazards, adequate risk assessments are indispensable. Satisfactory input data for these assessments are hard to acquire, especially in developing countries. Therefore, in this study, a methodology was developed and evaluated to test the sensitivity of a flood model towards its input data in order to determine a minimum set of indispensable data. In a first step, a flood damage assessment model was created for the case study of Annotto Bay, Jamaica. This model generates a damage map for the region based on the flood extent map of the 2001 inundations caused by Tropical Storm Michelle. Three damages were taken into account: building, road and crop damage. Twelve scenarios were generated, each with a different combination of input data, testing one of the three damage calculations for its sensitivity. One main conclusion was that population density, in combination with an average number of people per household, is a good parameter in determining the building damage when exact building locations are unknown. Furthermore, the importance of roads for an accurate visual result was demonstrated. © 2016 Author(s).",Analyzing the sensitivity of a flood risk assessment model towards its input data,2016,None,developing world; flood damage; hazard assessment; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; tropical cyclone event; Jamaica,0,1
12606,"Detection and characterization of territorial elements exposed to flood is a key component for flood risk analysis. Land-use description works well for small scales of representation but it becomes too coarse while increasing the scale. ""Single-element"" characterization is usually achieved through surveys, which become prohibitive as the amount of elements to be characterized increases. Mapping schemes represent a compromise between level of description and efforts for data collection. The basic idea is to determine the statistical distribution of building characteristics inside a homogeneous class starting from a sample area and to apply this distribution to the whole area, realizing a statistical extrapolation. An innovative approach was developed, merging the mapping scheme methodologies developed by the Global Earthquake Model [1] and Blanco-Vogt and Schanze [2], in which homogeneous classes are not development areas but building clusters. The approach was applied to the buildings in the Bisagno River floodplain, Genoa (Italy). Buildings were classified according to a building taxonomy. Once the percentage of basement presence was assigned to each class by surveying a limited subset of the exposed assets, a series of possible basement distributions was simulated to calculate the corresponding damage distributions for a real flood event. The total average damage obtained is very close to the refund claims, with a percentage error lower than 2%. © 2016 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",Application of an Earth-Observation-based building exposure mapping tool for flood damage assessment,2016,None,None,0,1
12611,"This paper presents a system reliability-based framework for collapse fragility assessment of steel braced moment-resisting frames (BMRFs). The conditional failure of intermediate events is calculated, considering two important features in the design of BMRFs: (i) different failure scenarios (FSs) with multiple sequences of components failure formation and (ii) structural reliability analysis based on the failure propagation from components to system. The system collapse reliability-based assessment of BMRFs is developed with an efficient algorithm using the Monte Carlo simulation procedure incorporated into a nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis program. An appropriate nonlinear FE model of such systems is demonstrated, and the probability of various predefined components' failure over the most likely FSs in the presence of both epistemic and inherent uncertainties is calculated. Then, a system-simulated reliability index (SSRI) is computed by lower and upper bounds in the probability of BMRF system collapse. Finally, fragility curves based on the SSRI is compared with the ones from incremental dynamic analysis, and later, the outcomes from multiple FSs are compared with the codified main collapse criterion. For the BMRFs analyzed herein, it is shown that the existing allowable story drift for the collapse limit state is conservative, and a new criterion is appraised.

12617,"Explosive population and economic development in the city has forced engineer to design and build more vertical buildings. In order to be resilient in earthquake prone region, these tall buildings have to achieve a specific level of performance under earthquake loading. A comprehensive methodology for assessing the seismic performance is required which can be attained by developing structural fragility function of the structure. Fragility curves is a probabilistic function relating damage level (engineering demand parameter) with intensity measure, i.e. spectral acceleration. This paper investigates the seismic performance of moment resisting frame as compared to frame-wall system of structures. The structural response of fully deterministic structural models was, then, analyzed employing nonlinear pushover analysis yielding capacity spectrums. For each capacity spectrum in every building system, the damage states were defined, whereas average inter-story drift values for each damage state were converted into corresponding amount of spectral acceleration leading to the development of fragility curves.

12618,"The seismic assessment of existing school buildings is of paramount importance to protect the lives of occupants and manage post-earthquake response and recovery. The collapse of a primary school during the 2002 Molise earthquake in Southern Italy increased the awareness of the need to better understand the potential vulnerability of the existing Italian school building stock. To this end, a recent research project entitled Progetto Scuole, whose main objective was to assess the seismic risk of a number of representative school buildings, was carried out at the Eucentre Foundation, in collaboration with the University School for Advanced Studies IUSS, in Pavia, Italy. The results of this project and of the subsequent research conducted by the authors are discussed in this paper, starting with the compilation of a school building database, focusing on the structural typology, the geometrical configuration and the time of construction. Three schools, representative of the Italian school building stock, were then analysed in detail through advanced numerical models developed using information collected during in-situ inspections and calibrated with the results of ambient vibration measurements. Two site locations were chosen to perform probabilistic seismic hazard analysis and select hazard-consistent ground motion record sets adopting the seismicity model used for the calculation of the Italian national seismic hazard map currently in place. Expected annual loss was used as a performance parameter to quantify the seismic vulnerability of the school buildings. Furthermore, the results of the detailed loss estimation were compared with the outcome of the seismic risk classification guidelines, recently introduced in Italy, applied to these same buildings. Finally, this paper presents a preliminary extension of the results to estimate the seismic risk of school buildings of the same typologies if located throughout the Italian territory.",Assessing seismic risk in typical Italian school buildings: From in-situ survey to loss estimation,2020,School buildings; Loss estimation; Seismic assessment; Vulnerability; Retrofit,DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; FRAGILITY CURVES; MODEL,0,1
12621,"With 6.5 million households in the United States located in areas prone to storm surge, assessing the vulnerability of structures and residential communities to coastal flooding is an important concern. Of particular interest is understanding how the performance of structures during surge events is influenced by flood conditions, coastal defenses, and building design at both the house and community level. This study presents such a vulnerability analysis by investigating the impact of coastal flooding from Hurricane Sandy (2012) on 95 km of developed coastline across New Jersey and New York. Exterior structural damage observed from a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) aerial survey of the study area is related to (1) a hindcast simulation of flood inundation and wave action, (2) a classification of coastal defenses and storm-induced erosion, and (3) minimum building design elevations specified in FEMA’s flood hazard mapping. Findings indicate that the hardest hit communities experienced significant dune erosion, which coincided with severe flood and wave exposure. Furthermore, structures were considerably more susceptible to flood impact if Sandy’s flood level exceeded FEMA’s 100-year Base Flood Elevation dictating building design. These results are quantified by developing fragility curves relating both house and community-level performance to the considered vulnerability parameters. Findings from this study can be used to inform decision making for improving coastal resilience. © 2018 Hatzikyriakou and Lin.",Assessing the vulnerability of structures and residential communities to storm surge: An analysis of flood impact during hurricane sandy,2018,Base Flood Elevation; Community; Dune; Federal Emergency Management Agency; Flood; Hurricane Sandy; Storm surge; Structural vulnerability,None,0,1
12625,"Slow-moving landslides are a natural hazard which affects wide areas in the world and often are cause of significant damage to structures and infrastructures. Analysis of landslide evolution and of their interaction with existing man-made structures plays a key role in risk prevention and mitigation activities. To this purpose, a considerable interest towards innovative approaches has grown among the scientific community and land management institutions. In this work, Synthetic Aperture Radar data acquired by C-band and X-band sensors, combined with numerical analyses, have been successfully applied as a tool to detect spatial and temporal landslide-induced effects, in terms of deformations and structural behavior of a building affected by ground instability. Such approach has been applied to Moio della Civitella urban settlement (Salerno province, Italy), whose whole territory is interested by several slow-moving landslides. In detail, performance of a masonry building aggregate and the efficacy of restoration works have been investigated through an integrated assessment of displacement time-series pre- and post-repair intervention, and structural analysis performed with numerical code. Historical DInSAR data have permitted firstly the interpretation of building displacement time-series corresponding to pre- and post-works configurations; subsequently, the analysis of interpolated interferometric products has allowed to define gradient maps of vertical and horizontal displacements and to identify part of aggregate which can suffer a greater susceptibility to damage as a consequence of deformation gradients. Finally, the comparison of satellite and numerical data showed a substantial agreement with local failures and damage surveyed, thus confirming the capability of DInSAR technique to investigate building performance where no in situ displacement measurements were available.",Assessment of building behavior in slow-moving landslide-affected areas through DInSAR data and structural analysis,2019,Slow-moving landslides; Building damage; Displacement monitoring; DInSAR,VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; DEFORMATION; INTERFEROMETRY; MAPS,0,1
12629,"A methodology is developed for first-order assessment of the seismic risk involving seismic hazard, local building inventory, and evaluation of respective vulnerability. Central to the vulnerability analysis is the concept of fragility functions used to determine the probability of exceedance of a specified damage state, where the nonlinear structural behaviour is defined by capacity curves. A new set of continuous hazard-compatible fragility functions is proposed for rapid risk assessment on urban and regional scales in interactive spreadsheet application. To demonstrate the method, it was applied in a dense urban environment of downtown Quebec City, Canada, for damage assessment of low-rise wood light frame and unreinforced brick masonry buildings. Earthquake scenario with M6.2 and distance 10 km from the centroid of the study area was developed from deaggregation of the seismic hazard defined by the current National Building Code of Canada-NBCC 2010. The ground shaking was represented with a simplified site-specific response spectrum, fully defined with spectral accelerations at 0.3 and 1.0 s. The results show that as much as 61% of the considered buildings would sustain certain degree of damage. The influence of epistemic uncertainties in the ground motion prediction and the site-class on damage estimation is evaluated. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

12631,"Seismic vulnerability evaluations of buildings and critical infrastructure in densely populated cities strongly rely on fragility curves to estimate the probability of reaching or exceeding a given state of damage. Currently, however, the predicting capabilities of these models is limited. This paper presents a critical study of the accuracy of fragility curves for buildings, urban bridges, tunnels, overpasses, main roads, avenues and metro stations, aiming at establishing its advantages and shortcomings, when using them in seismic vulnerability and resilience assessments. Data gathered from one of the most damage areas during the 7.1 Mw September Mexico-Puebla 2017 earthquake was used in this study. Measured peak ground accelerations, PGA, and permanent ground deformations, PGD, along with appropriate fragility curves were used to establish the probability of having minor, moderate, large damage or collapse of buildings and critical infrastructure components. The damage on the study area documented during field reconnaissance was compared to that which would have been predicted using the fragility curves. Although in some cases, there was a good agreement between predicted and observed damage, overall it was clearly identified the need for developing fragility models that account for soil-structure interaction, and specific structural and ground conditions, to ensure a more reliable risk characterization of the City building stock and infrastructure during an earthquake. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Assessment of fragility models based on the Sept 19th, 2017 earthquake observed damage",2019,Mexico city; Seismic fragility curves; Seismic vulnerability,Critical infrastructures; Curves (road); Earthquakes; Soil structure interactions; Subway stations; Fragility curves; Ground conditions; Mexico City; Peak ground acceleration; Permanent ground deformation; Risk characterization; Seismic fragility curves; Seismic vulnerability; Damage detection; critical analysis; earthquake damage; earthquake event; ground conditions; peak acceleration; risk assessment; soil-structure interaction; structural response; vulnerability; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico City; Mexico [North America],0,1
12651,"Unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings that are characterized by brittle, heterogeneous, and anisotropic responses have complex nonlinear dynamic behavior and high vulnerability under seismic loading. While masonry confined by tie-columns and lintel beams can achieve better ductility and stability, the wall openings induce stress concentration around the corners and diminish the strength. Furthermore, the interacting in-plane and out-of-plane responses of masonry walls could significantly affect the post-cracking behavior and increase the collapse risk. To attain reliable seismic design of confined masonry buildings with openings, the collapse fragility under bi-directional seismic loading shall be addressed and thoroughly investigated in this study. Advanced discrete finite element models (DFEM) with coupled damage-plasticity traction-separation law, which can simulate complex nonlinear dynamic behavior such as disintegration and progressive collapse, were developed for the masonry structures and validated against experimental results. Four one-storey residential masonry buildings: (1) unconfined (UCM), (2) confined by tie-columns at four building corners (CM-I), (3) confined by toothed tie-columns (CM-II), and (4) confined by toothed tie-columns and lintel beams (CM-III) were considered. A series of incremental dynamic analyses (IDA) with 15 bi-directional ground motions and fragility analyses were performed to investigate the dynamic characteristics, base shear, hysteresis behavior, failure mechanism, collapse probability, and exceedance probability for different drift limits were studied in-depth. CM-II with toothed tie-columns had the lowest collapse probability and fragility at different drift limit states. The introduction of lintel beams to CM-III lead to an increase of the storey-drift-based fragility compared to CM-II, as a result of the increased maximum base shear of CM-III with higher post-damage stiffness. The lintel beams also inflicted short-column effects on the tie-columns. Nevertheless, the lintel beams could delay the out-of-plane collapse of the masonry walls by shortening the effective wall arching length. In some cases, the CM-III could achieve better performances than CM-II even in terms of storey drifts. The response variations of CM-III to the changing of the non-intensity related ground motion parameters are also lower than CM-II. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Bi-directional collapse fragility assessment by DFEM of unreinforced masonry buildings with openings and different confinement configurations,2021,bi-directional response; confined masonry; discrete finite element modelling; fragility curves; incremental dynamic analysis; openings; toothed-tie column,Disintegration; Failure (mechanical); Masonry construction; Masonry materials; Probability; Retaining walls; Seismic design; Seismology; Structural dynamics; Bi-directional ground motions; Complex nonlinear dynamics; Dynamic characteristics; Exceedance probability; Ground motion parameters; Incremental dynamic analysis; Traction-separation law; Unreinforced masonry building; Walls (structural partitions),0,1
12654,"Passive control systems, such as buckling restrained braces (BRBs), have emerged as an efficient tool for the seismic response control of new and existing structures by providing strength and stiffness to buildings, in addition to high and stable energy dissipation capacity. Systems equipped with BRBs have been widely investigated in literature, however, only deterministic description of the BRBs' properties is usually considered. These properties are provided by the manufacturer and are successively validated by qualification control tests. The acceptance criteria specified by codal standards allows for some variation in the response of a single BRB by introducing a tolerance limit. Therefore, the 'real' properties of these devices could differ from the design values. This difference can affect the seismic response and potentially lead to an undesired seismic performance at the global level. This paper provides some preliminary insights on the influence of the BRBs' uncertainty on the seismic response of a retrofitted RC frame. For the case-study, a benchmark two-dimensional RC frame is considered. A single retrofit condition is analyzed and the BRBs' uncertainty is defined according to the tolerance limits of devices' quality control tests. Cloud analysis and probabilistic seismic demand models are used to develop fragility functions for four different damage states. Fragility curves are defined for the bare and retrofitted frame while considering both the design and the 'real' values of the BRBs properties. The preliminary results show that the BRBs' uncertainty could lead to an increase of the vulnerability up to 26.80% for the considered case-study. © 13th International Conference on Applications of Statistics and Probability in Civil Engineering, ICASP 2019.

12658,"Objectives: The building collapse is the main cause of casualties and economic losses in all kinds of disasters. Accurate assessment of the collapse of buildings is an important basis for disaster rescue and government decision-making, and plays an important role in the proper placement of the victims, the protection of the lives and property of the victims. Therefore, the rapid assessment of building collapse after disaster is a research hotspot in the field of remote sensing and civil engineering. The main objectives of this study was to apply the deep learning technology to automatically identify and assess building collapse and structural damage with on-site images. Methods: The building collapse assessment method used in this paper is ResNet (residual network). A ResNet-50 architecture was implemented in TensorFlow, which consists of 5 stages each with a convolution and identity block, 3 convolution layers in each convolution block and 3 convolution layers in each identity block. According to the building damage assessment standard developed by the China Earthquake Administration, the evaluation output of this model is adjusted to three types: Completely collapsed, semi-collapsed, and non-collapse. In the data augmentation process, geometry transformation and blur processing were used to simulate different shooting environments, to reduce the overfitting of the classifier model by enhancing the training image. Through data expansion, the number of training data has been increased by at least 10 times on the basis of PEER Hub ImageNet Challenge open dataset. In the process of transfer learning, the gradient descent algorithm was used to adjust and optimize the parameters of the neural network. The results of this method were evaluated by using accuracy and Kappa coefficient.Results: Finally, in the building collapse assessment experiment, the classification accuracy of the assessment model reached 77.23% and the Kappa coefficient was 0.65; in the structural damage assessment experiment, the classification accuracy of the assessment model reached 77% and the Kappa coefficient was 0.693.The proposed collapse classification successfully attains a relatively high rate for true-positives.Overall, this method performed well.

12661,"Sudden-onset natural and man-made disasters represent a threat to the safety of human life and property. Rapid and accurate building damage assessment using bitemporal high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images can quickly and safely provide us with spatial distribution information and statistics of the damage degree to assist with humanitarian assistance and disaster response. For building damage assessment, strong feature representation and semantic consistency are the keys to obtaining a high accuracy. However, the conventional object-based image analysis (OBIA) framework using a patch-based convolutional neural network (CNN) can guarantee semantic consistency, but with weak feature representation, while the Siamese fully convolutional network approach has strong feature representation capabilities but is semantically inconsistent. In this paper, we propose a deep object-based semantic change detection framework, called ChangeOS, for building damage assessment. To seamlessly integrate OBIA and deep learning, we adopt a deep object localization network to generate accurate building objects, in place of the superpixel segmentation commonly used in the conventional OBIA framework. Furthermore, the deep object localization network and deep damage classification network are integrated into a unified semantic change detection network for end-to-end building damage assessment. This also provides deep object features that can supply an object prior to the deep damage classification network for more consistent semantic feature representation. Object-based post-processing is adopted to further guarantee the semantic consistency of each object. The experimental results obtained on a global scale dataset including 19 natural disaster events and two local scale datasets including the Beirut port explosion event and the Bata military barracks explosion event show that ChangeOS is superior to the currently published methods in speed and accuracy, and has a superior generalization ability for man-made disasters.",Building damage assessment for rapid disaster response with a deep object-based semantic change detection framework: From natural disasters to man-made disasters,2021,Building damage assessment; Change detection; Disaster response; Deep learning; Remote sensing; OBIA,None,0,1

12678,"A new methodology, Robust Simulation, has been developed for seismic risk assessment of geographically-distributed groups of buildings or other assets (portfolios) based on simulations that follow coherent epistemic tracks through the logic trees that are used to manage epistemic uncertainty. The ensembles of outputs preserve and display the uncertainty that results from the use of multiple models of seismicity, ground motion attenuation and building damage, presenting a more transparent and comprehensive view of risk. In this paper, a residential portfolio in California is modeled with ground motion simulations that conform to the USGS National Seismic Hazard Mapping Project [Petersen et al., 2014], with three different damage models-HAZUS [Kircher et al., 1997], Code-Oriented Damage Assessment, or CODA [Graf & Lee, 2009] and Wood Frame Single Family Dwelling [Wesson et al., 2004]. We compare the ensemble of solutions obtained through Robust Simulation with those found using conventional portfolio seismic risk methods (e.g., a single ""mean"" solution from a conventional catastrophe model) to reveal the importance of considering epistemic uncertainty. © Copyright (2018 by Earthquake Engineering Research Institute All rights reserved.",Catastrophe loss modeling through robust simulation,2018,None,Disasters; Earthquake effects; Earthquake engineering; Engineering geology; Historic preservation; Housing; Risk assessment; Uncertainty analysis; Catastrophe model; Damage assessments; Distributed groups; Epistemic uncertainties; Ground-motion attenuations; Ground-motion simulation; Robust simulations; Seismic risk assessment; Damage detection,0,1
12680,"Coastal settlements worldwide have suffered significant damage and loss to tsunami hazards in the last few decades. This period coincides with socio-economic changes that have heightened spatio-temporal risk through increased coastal development and infrastructure. In this study, we apply a spatio-temporal loss model to quantify the changes in direct economic losses to residential buildings from tsunami hazards over a 20-year period in Omaha Beach, New Zealand. The approach reconstructed temporal urban settlement patterns (1992, 1996, 2006 and 2012) for an area potentially exposed to regional source tsunami inundation hazard. Synthetic depth-damage functions for specific building classes were applied to estimate temporal damage and loss from tsunami inundation exposure at each building location. Temporal loss estimates were reported for a range of risk metrics, including probable maximum loss, loss exceedance and average annual loss. The results showed that an increase in the number of buildings and changes to building design (i.e., storeys, floor area, foundations) influenced the increasing risk to direct economic loss over the study period. These increases were driven by conversion from rural to urban land use since 1996. The spatio-temporal method presented in this study can be adapted to analyse changing risk patterns and trends for coastal settlements to inform future tsunami mitigation measures and manage direct economic losses.","Changes in Tsunami Risk to Residential Buildings at Omaha Beach, New Zealand",2019,tsunami hazard; coastal development; building attributes; synthetic vulnerability functions; direct economic losses; spatio-temporal risk changes,FLOOD DAMAGE ESTIMATION; FRAGILITY CURVES; VULNERABILITY; CHALLENGES; MODEL,0,1
12682,"Floods are the most devastating natural hazards in the United States, and these events lead to significant economic consequences. Estimation of damages and losses at different parts of the floodplain can be used to identify the vulnerable areas susceptible to flood. Floodplain maps combined with damage assessment could identify high-flood-risk areas and present a platform to develop guidelines and zoning resolutions for proper land use, building new infrastructures, and placing and retracting residential areas. In this study, a risk-based methodology is proposed to quantitatively assess damages. For this purpose, a geographic information system 04016016-based approach is used as an alternative to more complex software packages. The system is called a flood-damage estimator (FDE) and utilizes empirical synthetic depth-damage functions, land-use data, digital elevation model (DEM), raster maps (for featuring the characteristics of the properties at flood risk areas), and floodplain extent for the region in order to estimate flood damage. The results from this model are compared with the results of flood hazard analysis module in the FEMA HAZard United States (HAZUS) software. This model uses different characteristics, such as ground elevation and storm surge elevations to estimate flood damages and losses. In both models, a 100-year floodplain proposed by the FEMA flood insurance studies (FISs) of 2007 and 2013, as well as floodplain developed by the gridded surface subsurface hydrologic analysis (GSSHA)-distributed hydrologic model, are used to determine the flood water depth at different locations. This hydrologic model provides input from simultaneous consideration of inland and coastal flooding to the damage estimation model. The proposed methodology is applied to Manhattan. The results show the significant value of combining GIS-based models with damage-risk analysis to provide a flexible and simple platform for damage estimation as an alternative to the HAZUS model. Flood-risk maps created based on the damage estimation are of great use and importance in proper planning for land use and setting priorities for allocation of financial resources in recovery and reconstruction plans. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Coastal flood damage estimator: An alternative to FEMA's HAZUS platform,2016,Coastal flood; FEMA flood insurance study (FIS); Flood damage; Flood-risk maps; Geographic information system (GIS); Gridded surface subsurface hydrologic analysis (GSSHA); HAZard United States (HAZUS),Banks (bodies of water); Flood damage; Flood insurance; Geographic information systems; Hazards; Information systems; Information use; Land use; Maps; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Surveying; Coastal floods; Digital elevation model; Distributed hydrologic model; Economic consequences; FEMA flood insurance study (FIS); Flood risk maps; Hydrologic analysis; Hydrologic modeling; Damage detection; digital elevation model; flood damage; GIS; hazard assessment; hydrological modeling; land use; raster; risk assessment; United States,0,1
12687,"Study of collapse-resisting properties of structures has attracted widespread attention because of frequently occurring earthquakes and extreme events (e.g. blast) around the world. The developments in computational methods have enabled researchers to numerically simulate the collapse of structures under different kinds of loadings and provide reliable assessments of the collapse performance of structures. The dynamic nature of structural collapse requires a direct integration algorithm to solve the equations of motion of the numerical simulation model. A major concern in such simulations is the computational efficiency, which stems from the need to use a small time step size in both implicit algorithm and explicit algorithm. In this paper, modeling techniques to simulate typical failure mechanisms in reinforced concrete frame structures combined with the application of the recently developed explicit, unconditionally stable, parametrically dissipative KR-alpha integration method to investigate collapse simulation are presented. A fiber beam-column element is used to model the frame members, where the material nonlinearities, especially material softening, are simulated by a plastic damage model combined with a failure criterion. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the proposed collapse simulation technique. The results indicate that the proposed technique provides an accurate result and has exceptional computational efficiency.

12695,"Recent seismic events produced considerable socio-economic losses. An important step for the reduction and mitigation of seismic risk in urban areas with a high population density is the assessment of global vulnerability of clustered buildings. The proposed work aims at appraising the seismic vulnerability of building aggregates within the historical center of Arsita, damaged by the L'Aquila earthquake (2009 April 6th), through a multi-level approach deriving from the application of different estimation procedures. In particular, the seismic vulnerability quantification has been done by comparing three distinct methods, namely the macroseismic approach according to the EMS-98 scale, the Vulnus methodology, developed by the University of Padua, and the mechanical approach derived from using the 3Muri software. The expected damage has been estimated in terms of fragility curves, respectively, for the entire buildings compound and the individual structural units located in the corner and intermediate positions, in order to evaluate the beneficial or detrimental aggregate effect on the seismic behavior of individual constructions examined. © Copyright © 2019 Chieffo and Formisano.",Comparative Seismic Assessment Methods for Masonry Building Aggregates: A Case Study,2019,fragility curves; macroseismic method; masonry aggregates; mechanical method; non-linear analysis; vulnerability assessment; Vulnus method,None,0,1
12696,"After the 2010 Maule earthquake, Chilean authorities now require the implementation of base isolation systems in new public hospital build-ings. However, in Chile the typical seismic force-resisting system of non-isolated hospitals is made up of reinforced concrete shear walls, whereas that of isolated buildings is made up of reinforced concrete frames. Since the former is much stiffer than the latter, there is then a question on the actual effectiveness of base isolation in reducing the seismic demands on new hospitals with respect to that on conventional hospitals, particularly the interstory drift demand under relatively low levels of ground shaking. Motivated by this context, this study evaluates the main results of a comparative analysis of the seismic performance of isolated and non-isolated hospitals considering the typical structural system in each case. Representative structural layouts were defined for both types of hospital buildings based on the Chilean state of the practice. Further, possible influence of the number of stories was considered. Member sizes and isolation system properties were determined in accordance to the current Chilean seismic design codes. The structural models were subjected to nonlinear time history analyses under two simultaneous horizontal components of ground motions selected from the Chilean database of earthquake records. The seismic response was evaluated through fragility curves, which were developed from results given by incremental dynamic analysis. Several limit states associated with the isolation systems, structural elements and nonstructural components of hospitals were considered. Results are compared with empirical observations on the effects of earthquakes on the Chilean building inventory, and the suitability of limit state thresholds defined in the literature is discussed. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Comparative Seismic Fragility Analysis of Conventional and Base Isolated Hospital Buildings Having Different Structural Systems,2020,2010 Chile earthquake; base isolation; Fragility analysis; hospital buildings; incremental dynamic analysis,Concrete construction; Earthquakes; Reinforced concrete; Seismic design; Seismic response; Shear walls; Structural analysis; Base isolation systems; Incremental dynamic analysis; Non-structural components; Nonlinear time history analysis; Reinforced concrete frames; Reinforced concrete shear walls; Seismic fragility analysis; State of the practice; Hospitals,0,1
12697,"Superelastic viscous damper is a passive hybrid control device that combines shape memory alloy cables and a viscoelastic damper to mitigate dynamic response of structures subjected to multi-level seismic hazards. In the hybrid device, shape memory alloy cables that exhibit a nonlinear but elastic response are used mainly as re-centering unit, while the viscoelastic damper composed of high-damped butyl rubber compounds is employed to augment the equivalent viscous damping provided by the device. This study evaluates the effectiveness of superelastic viscous dampers in mitigating seismic response of steel frame structures through a probabilistic framework. First, a nine-story steel frame building is designed and modeled with and without superelastic viscous dampers, and extensive nonlinear response-history analyses are conducted. Then, probabilistic demand models are developed for selected engineering demand parameters. To quantitatively compare the performance of the designed buildings, seismic fragility curves and mean annual frequency of exceeding different performance levels are developed. In particular, the structural performance is evaluated using both peak inter-story drift and residual drift responses. Results indicate that superelastic viscous dampers can significantly improve structural performance; thus, it has the potential to lower the post-earthquake losses, as the better structural performance leads to less loss in relocation, rental, and economic loss. © The Author(s) 2018.",Comparative seismic fragility estimates of steel moment frame buildings with or without superelastic viscous dampers,2018,Fragility curves; high-damped butyl rubber; shape memory alloy; structural control,Cables; Losses; Rubber; Seismic response; Shape memory effect; Steel construction; Structural dynamics; Structural frames; Viscoelasticity; Butyl rubber; Engineering demand parameters; Equivalent viscous damping; Fragility curves; Nonlinear response history analysis; Probabilistic framework; Seismic fragility curves; Structural control; Structural analysis,0,1
12698,"The serious consequences of the last tsunamis that occurred in India in 2004 and in Japan in 2011 have attracted the attention of engineers and specialists in order to develop tools to calculate, to verify and to assess the vulnerability of buildings against this devastating disaster. The objective of the present work is to establish a comparative study of the behavior of metallic structures and the ones of reinforced concrete under the effect of the forces generated by the tsunami waves. For this purpose, a simplified modeling of tsunamic forces has been established on the basis of experimental models expressing the intensity of these forces as a function of time. Then, the time history methods and the Pushover analysis have been combined in order to establish the capacity curves. Then, the vulnerability criteria of each one of the studied structures have been determined under the effect of the tsunamic solicitations. This will evaluate the performance of both materials based on the different degrees of damage recorded. Thanks to the simplified modeling of the tsunami forces proposed in this comparative study, it has been possible to perform the time history analysis of the two types of structures. The result obtained can be used for the benefit of the concerned officials in the design and programming of the development plans of the highly exposed coastal cities and to establish a judicious choice of the types of materials adapted to this kind of disaster.

12699,"A loss and damage assessment was performed for the buildings of Lorca, Spain, considering an earthquake hazard scenario with similar characteristics to those of a real event which occurred on May 11th, 2011, in terms of epicentre, depth and magnitude while also considering the local soil response. This low-to moderate earthquake caused severe damage and disruption in the region and especially on the city. A building by building resolution database was developed and used for damage and loss assessment. The portfolio of buildings was characterized by means of indexes capturing information from a structural point of view such as age, main construction materials, number of stories, and building class as well as others related to age and vulnerability classes. A replacement cost approach was selected for the analysis in order to calculate the direct losses incurred by the event. Seismic hazard and vulnerability were modelled in a probabilistic way, considering their inherent uncertainties which were also taken into account in the damage and loss calculation process. Losses have been expressed in terms of the mean damage ratio of each dwelling and since the analysis has been performed on a geographical information system platform, the distribution of the damage and its categories was mapped for the entire urban centre. The simulated damages and losses were compared with the observed ones reported by the local authorities and institutions that inspected the city after the event. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Comparing observed damages and losses with modelled ones using a probabilistic approach: The Lorca 2011 case,2016,CAPRA; Comparison of losses; Model calibration and validation; Probabilistic seismic hazard analysis; Probabilistic seismic risk assessment,None,0,1
12700,"The main aim of this study is to assess the seismic behavior of various knee braced steel frames using nonlinear static and dynamic analyses. For this, structures with four different types of knee braces at heights of 5, 10, 15 and 20 stories are designed through ETABS and then are three-dimensionally modeled via PERFORM 3D. Firstly, various seismic parameters including response modification factor, ductility factor, deflection amplification factor and overstrength factor of the structures are compared via implementing the pushover analysis. Secondly, target models are subjected to five far-fault and five near-fault records. Fragility curves as well as curves obtained from the incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) are then compared, so as to determine the best type of bracing in terms of seismic performance. Benefiting results of non-linear static analyses, top knee, x-knee, chevron knee and double knee braced frames have the best seismic performance, respectively. Likewise, using IDA results in the far-fault area, x-knee, top knee, chevron knee and double-knee braced frames demonstrate the best performance, respectively. In addition, in near-field area at the height of 5 stories, the best performance is correspondingly attributed to x-knee, top-knee, chevron knee and double knee braces, respectively.

12704,"In this study, manual and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) surveys of physical damage to structures in Ortley Beach, New Jersey, following Hurricane Sandy are used to assess the vulnerability of residential structures to storm surge. First, using photographs from the manual survey, the performance of building components prone to surge damage (foundations, exterior walls, and wall siding) is assessed according to failure mechanism, construction type, and material. General observations include widespread failure of closed foundations, significant vulnerability of exterior walls to surge loads and waterborne debris impact, and the extensive loss of vinyl lap siding. The effect of the built environment is also investigated, revealing that the study area consists of two regions: one heavily damaged due to the failure of coastal dunes and another partially protected by large oceanfront structures acting as artificial breakwaters. The performance of individual structures is likewise found to strongly influence the performance of nearby buildings, either by shielding inland structures from surge loads or by generating damaging waterborne debris. Next, a statistical analysis of various vulnerability parameters characterizing structures and the built environment reveals that the distance of buildings from the coast is the most significant damage predictor, with additional factors such as house age and elevation off the ground also affecting component performance. Vulnerability curves and vulnerability surfaces giving the probability of component failure as functions of these significant vulnerability parameters are then developed across different surge environments, component types, and failure mechanisms, providing a quantification of the observed damage features. Fragility curves are also developed to depict the severity of waterborne debris impact. Finally, using airborne and mobile LiDAR surveys, a method for rapidly assessing foundation failure by detecting changes in a structure's location is proposed and validated for Ortley Beach. Applying this method to other New Jersey communities experiencing a similar surge (Seaside Heights and Normandy Beach), overall coastal performance is found to largely reflect the failure mode of the community's dunes. This study presents a framework for rigorously understanding storm surge impact through improved survey methods, assessment procedures, and statistical analyses.

12716,"The hydrodynamic effects of flooding during extreme storm events are the leading cause of structural damage to impacted properties and due to their complexity, it is difficult to accurately estimate structural damage and flood vulnerability. We propose a robust structural damage assessment model that considers the dynamic behavior of flooding coupled with the structural and regional characteristics of buildings by using of a pair hydrodynamic model i.e., the advanced circulation (ADCIRC) and two-dimensional unsteady flow (TUFLOW). Fine-scale inland flooding scenarios were developed to simulate heavily impacted areas of coastal New Jersey in the United States (US) based on the historical storm Hurricane Sandy (2012). The models were calibrated and validated using multiple sets of observed data as well as using several performance metrics. The corresponding Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and R-squared (R2) values were found to be in the range of 0.426–0.81 and 0.56–0.91, respectively, during the ADCIRC calibration process. A spatial comparison with the observed inundation data revealed that the correlation coefficient and root mean square error (RMSE) for the inland flood modelling by TUFLOW were 0.79 and 0.71, respectively, with a 96.49% coefficient of similarity. A structural damage model was developed by combining the hydrodynamic components of flooding with several structural characteristics. In a comparison of the observed and model-simulated damage counts, the results indicate the conservative nature of the damage-prediction model with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 40.26 and RMSE of 58.67.

12732,"This paper proposes a dynamic structural health monitoring and damage detection method to assess the structural integrity and safety of an RC framed building with masonry infills. The effectiveness of the method is verified by numerical analyses that were performed on a RC moment-resisting frame structure investigated by Paultre et al. and applied on an existing RC framed building with masonry infill walls, which provide a strong contribution to the dynamic response and seismic performance of the building. Different damage states are simulated through the nonlinear static (pushover) analysis developed by the FE model of the building, and this analysis considers both the bare framed structure and the infilled structure to appraise the damage to the infill walls. The identification and location of the damage is estimated using the modal properties of the damaged building at various steps of the nonlinear analysis. The results highlight the different evolutions of the damage in the bare and infilled frames and the possibility of detection via dynamic monitoring. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Damage assessment of an existing RC infilled structure by numerical simulation of the dynamic response,2019,Damage detection; Dynamic identification; Masonry infill walls; RC framed buildings,Dynamic response; Infill drilling; Masonry materials; Nonlinear analysis; Numerical methods; Structural frames; Structural health monitoring; Walls (structural partitions); Damage assessments; Different evolutions; Dynamic identification; Dynamic monitoring; Framed buildings; Masonry infills; Moment resisting frames; Seismic Performance; Damage detection,0,1
12760,"Seismic risk mitigation at national scale requires the vulnerability assessment of the built stock, which is generally based on the definition of appropriate fragility curves by means of different methods. A first type of methods uses an empirical approach with calibration from observed damage. A second group of methods uses mechanical models suitable to describe the structural behavior; however, because an in-depth geometric and structural characterization of the buildings is very time-consuming at the territorial level, these models must remain “as simple as possible” to limit the number of input parameters. The aim of this work is to estimate the fragility of the Italian masonry buildings stock grouped in macro-typologies ISTAT (National Institute of Statistics), i.e. defined by construction age and number of stories; this is essential for deriving damage scenarios at territorial scale based solely on ISTAT information. Vulnus Vb 4.0 (2009), a software developed at the University of Padova, was found to be very useful for this purpose as it provides fragility curves of masonry buildings assessing the in-plane (IP) failure, the principal out-of-plane (OOP) mechanisms and the main typological-structural characteristics; judgments on the quality of information are also used to provide an upper and lower fragility limit. More than 500 buildings were examined with this software, appropriately chosen to guarantee a good statistical representation of the built stock. The information for each building was retrieved directly from the related projects and, in the case of missing information, reference was made to design manuals and codes, and to specific literature. Finally, the fragility results were processed to provide a mean fragility curve (representing the trigger of an IP - OOP mechanism) and a range of possible dispersion for each ISTAT macro-typology. These results can also be used to calibrate macro-seismic models of vulnerability in the literature, if the will is to represent this mechanical fragility in a more distributed way, i.e. with more damage states.

12765,"In seismic analysis of building, infill wall is usually modelled as non-structural elements and, hence, are not taken into account in analytical models. In general, engineers and scientists model these widely used structural system of masonry infilled reinforced concrete frame by considering the infill wall as load applied to the open confining frame. The presence of masonry infills, however, may significantly alter both the stiffness and the strength of the overall structural frame system. This present study aims to evaluate seismic performance of this type of building by developing fragility functions of the structure. Masonry wall was modelled as diagonal strut within the concrete frame. The masonry constituents and its composite properties were determined for the model. Then, the structure was subjected to incremental static lateral loading while adaptive pushover analysis was utilized to predict the response of the structure. As the damage states were defined from the spectral capacity curves, the fragility functions were developed for the structure. Effect of masonry wall included in the analysis was then compared to the results of open frame. The result of the eigen value analysis shows, the period for modelling a structure with an infill wall is smaller compared to modelling a structure without infill wall (open frame). This shows that the existence of infill wall elements in modelling increases the value of structural stiffness so that it reduces the period of the structure. Whereas, the results of the fragility curve in both structural modelling show that at some level of damage, the probability of damage for modelling structures with infill walls is smaller when compared to open frame. Realistic and rational results is presented in this work which show that modelling masonry wall with compression strut is beneficial. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Determining fragility of urban low-to-mid rise masonry infilled building,2019,None,Infill drilling; Masonry construction; Reinforced concrete; Retaining walls; Seismology; Stiffness; Structural analysis; Struts; Composite properties; Compression struts; Non-structural elements; Push-over analysis; Reinforced concrete frames; Seismic Performance; Structural modelling; Structural stiffness; Walls (structural partitions),0,1
12770,"Seismic isolation technique is increasingly used both for the design of new buildings and for the seismic retrofit of existing buildings. Nevertheless, so far, little attention has been paid on the collapse capacity of these structures, mainly because it requires refined nonlinear models and careful consideration of different sources of uncertainties. To fill this gap, a set of collapse fragility functions for existing reinforced concrete-frame buildings, designed for gravity loads only and then retrofitted with different isolation systems (including rubber-based and friction-based isolation systems), are derived in this study. For completeness, buildings with low and high seismic resistance are also considered. Collapse fragility functions are derived through incremental dynamic analysis, considering different collapse conditions both for isolation system and superstructure. For each case study building, mean and dispersion values are obtained considering both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties, due to record-to record and model variability, respectively.

12776,"The present work proposes a fuzzy-random fragility assessment framework for evaluating 2D reinforced concrete moment frame buildings in the presence of various sources of uncertainty, most notably aleatory and epistemic. Such uncertainties exert a powerful influence on the nonlinear behavior of structural systems and consequently affect the seismic response of these structures. For this reason, a number of effective techniques including Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) simulation, fuzzy set theory, and a well-known α-cut approach have been used to quantify the median of the collapse fragility curve as the fuzzy-random response. As a major step in the α-cut approach, metaheuristic evolutionary algorithms including modified genetic algorithm (MGA), and a novel global optimization algorithm inspired by Mouth Brooding Fish (MBF) in nature have been adopted to explore the maximum and minimum of such median in each membership degree, α. The results demonstrate that the merit of new MBF algorithm is its greater efficiency in specifying the α-cut boundaries compared with MGA. Herein, for the sake of more simplicity and efficiency, a new equation is proposed for the prediction of the median of collapse fragility curve of the case-study building, using the gene expression programming (GEP) methodology. This median is formulated in terms of several effective parameters such as steel modulus of elasticity Es, steel yield stress fy, and concrete strength f′ c, which regarded as the input fuzzy-random variables. The performance and validity of the GEP model are further tested using several criteria. The results indicate that analyzing the proposed GEP model in terms of fuzzy-random variables thru the MBF algorithm significantly improves efficiency and reduces computational time by 75%. © 2020",Developing the seismic fragility analysis with fuzzy random variables using Mouth Brooding Fish algorithm,2020,Fuzzy sets; Genetic expression programming; Modified genetic algorithm; Mouth Brooding Fish algorithm; Seismic fragility analysis; Uncertainty,Computation theory; Efficiency; Fish; Fuzzy set theory; Fuzzy sets; Gene expression; Genetic algorithms; Global optimization; Random variables; Reinforced concrete; Seismic response; Uncertainty analysis; Yield stress; Gene expression programming; Genetic Expression Programming; Global optimization algorithm; Latin hypercube sampling; Modified genetic algorithms; Seismic fragility analysis; Sources of uncertainty; Uncertainty; Computational efficiency,0,1
12796,"In this study, strong ground motion record (SGMR) selection based on Eta (eta) as a spectral shape indicator has been investigated as applied to steel braced frame structures. A probabilistic seismic hazard disaggregation analysis for the definition of the target Epsilon (epsilon) and the target Eta (eta) values at different hazard levels is presented, taking into account appropriately selected SGMR's. Fragility curves are developed for different limit states corresponding to three representative models of typical steel braced frames having significant irregularities in plan, by means of a weighted damage index. The results show that spectral shape indicators have an important effect on the predicted median structural capacities, and also that the parameter eta is a more robust predictor of damage than searching for records with appropriate epsilon values.","Development of fragility curves by incorporating new spectral shape indicators and a weighted damage index: case study of steel braced frames in the city of Mashhad, Iran",2017,vulnerability; spectral shape indicator; incremental dynamic analysis; damage index; hazard disaggregation; record selection,SEISMIC COLLAPSE ASSESSMENT; INTENSITY MEASURE; BUILDINGS; MODEL,0,1
12799,"A single intensity measure (IM) is commonly used to develop fragility curves for structures subjected to mainshock-aftershock (MS-AS) scenarios. This study aims to propose a framework to develop MS-AS fragility surfaces by characterizing the MS-AS sequences with two IMs. To do this, the well-known Park & Ang damage index, which increases monotonically with the ground motion duration, is adopted to represent the accumulative structural damage during sequential excitations. The MS-AS accumulative damage of structures is thus represented by the combination of the initial damage caused by MS and the incremental damage caused by AS. Based on total probability theorem, the process of assessing MS-AS fragility is consequently divided into two parts, namely the MS fragility assessment and the AS fragility assessment, respectively, where the cases of dynamic instability are considered. The proposed framework is illustrated using a typical four-story reinforced concrete frame building. The peak ground velocity values of both MS and AS are taken as the representative IMs for the MS-AS sequences. The fragility results for MS only and MS-AS sequences are compared to scrutinize the effects of AS on structural damage. It is found that the MS-AS sequence can cause significantly larger exceedance probabilities of limit states compared to the MS only. The MS-AS sequence also leads to a reduction of the MS-AS fragility median conditioned on a given AS intensity. Such reduction increases with the increase of the AS intensity. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Development of fragility surfaces for reinforced concrete buildings under mainshock-aftershock sequences,2021,damage accumulation; fragility surface; mainshock-aftershock sequence; RC frame; total probability theorem,Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Damage detection; Earthquakes; Structural analysis; Accumulative damage; Aftershock sequence; Dynamic instability; Exceedance probability; Fragility assessment; Peak ground velocity; Reinforced concrete frame buildings; Total probabilities; Reinforced concrete,0,1
12805,"Concrete buildings reinforced by plain bars are one of the special types of old structures generally built before the 1970s. According to the experiences of earthquakes and experimental tests, the dominant damage mode in these structures includes a deep crack at the intersection of the beam with the joint panel zone. In this study, seismic fragility curves of existing concrete buildings reinforced by plain bars were investigated by means of incremental dynamic analysis and by consideration of soil-type effects and construction quality effects. A relatively simple and efficient non-linear model based on the experimental behaviour of exterior and interior joints of the represented building is used to simulate pre- and post-elastic behaviour of the joints which fail under bar slippage mode. Two record sets were considered corresponding to the soil types C and D of the NEHRP provision. The results indicated that the seismic vulnerability of the represented building increases at all damage states as the type of soil changes from C to D. On average, the median capacity of the building is decreased by about 30% for the moderate limit state as the type of soil changes from C to D. Also, the normal distribution function with median data is the best distribution function for seismic fragility assessment of the represented building. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Development of seismic fragility curves for the existing RC building with plain bars,2020,beam-column joint; existing RC buildings; Fragility curve; incremental dynamic analysis; plain bars,Concrete buildings; Damage detection; Distribution functions; Normal distribution; Seismology; Soils; Construction quality; Elastic behaviour; Experimental test; Incremental dynamic analysis; Non-linear model; Seismic fragility; Seismic fragility curves; Seismic vulnerability; Reinforced concrete,0,1
12829,"An integrated web application, referred to as ER2 for rapid risk evaluator, is under development for a user-friendly seismic risk assessment by the non-expert public safety community. The assessment of likely negative consequences is based on pre-populated databases of seismic, building inventory and vulnerability parameters. To further accelerate the computation for near real-time analyses, implicit building fragility curves were developed as functions of the magnitude and the intensity of the seismic shaking defined with a single intensity measure, input spectral acceleration at 1.0 s implicitly considering the epicentral distance and local soil conditions. Damage probabilities were compared with those obtained with the standard fragility functions explicitly considering epicentral distances and local site classes in addition to the earthquake magnitudes and respective intensity of the seismic shaking. Different seismic scenarios were considered first for 53 building classes common in Eastern Canada, and then a reduced number of 24 combined building classes was proposed. Comparison of results indicate that the damage predictions with implicit fragility functions for short (M ≤ 5.5) and medium strong motion duration (5.5 &lt; M ≤ 7.5) show low variation with distance and soil class, with average error of less than 3.6%. © 2018 by the authors.

12830,"Earthquakes are natural phenomena, which induce natural hazard that seriously threatens urban areas, despite significant advances in retrofitting urban buildings and enhancing the knowledge and ability of experts in natural disaster control. Iran is one of the most seismically active countries in the world. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and analyze the extent of earthquake vulnerability in relation to demographic, environmental, and physical criteria. An earthquake risk assessment (ERA) map was created by using a Fuzzy-Analytic Hierarchy Process coupled with an Artificial Neural Networks (FAHP-ANN) model generating five vulnerability classes. Combining the application of a FAHP-ANN with a geographic information system (GIS) enabled to assign weights to the layers of the earthquake vulnerability criteria. The model was applied to Sanandaj City in Iran, located in the seismically active Sanandaj-Sirjan zone which is frequently affected by devastating earthquakes. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model was implemented in the IDRISI software and 250 points were validated for grades 0 and 1. The validation process revealed that the proposed model can produce an earthquake probability map with an accuracy of 95%. A comparison of the results attained by using a FAHP, AHP and MLP model shows that the hybrid FAHP-ANN model proved flexible and reliable when generating the ERA map. The FAHP-ANN model accurately identified the highest earthquake vulnerability in densely populated areas with dilapidated building infrastructure.

12837,"Although aftershocks have the potential to cause severe damage to buildings and threaten life safety, their effect in seismic risk analysis is not explicitly accounted for in modern building design codes, nor in emerging methodologies such as performance-based seismic design. The ultimate objective of this study is to systematically integrate aftershock hazard into performance-based earthquake engineering (PBEE) through analytical studies with structural degradation models derived from publicly available experimental data. In this paper, the first step is made by introducing a procedure to compute the probability of a mainshock-damaged woodframe building entering different damage states as a result of aftershock. Aftershock fragilities are developed by performing incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) using a sequence of mainshock-aftershock ground motions. To compute the seismic response of the damaged building, IDA is performed using a sequence of mainshocks of different intensity levels combined with random aftershocks. The variation in aftershock fragilities for each of the damage states for several different mainshock intensities is presented. The effect of the mainshock damage is to alter the fragilities and is quantified for the building investigated. It is observed that the fragility curves for collapse risk have a similar shape for the mainshock-aftershock sequences for different levels of mainshock. As well as that there was an unexpected result that, if the building model survives the mainshock, the additional collapse risk because of aftershocks may not be as critical as originally thought for engineered woodframe construction. The effect of aftershocks on damage states appears to be more significant, relatively speaking, than on collapse of low-rise woodframe buildings, indicating that including aftershock hazard on performance-based seismic design will be significant. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Effect of mainshock-aftershock sequences on woodframe building damage fragilities,2015,Aftershock fragilities; Collapse fragilities; Incremental dynamic analysis; Performance-based seismic design; Structural degradation models; Woodframe building,Architectural design; Hazards; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Seismic design; Seismic response; Aftershock fragilities; Collapse fragilities; Incremental dynamic analysis; Performance based seismic design; Structural degradation; Woodframe buildings; Earthquakes,0,1
12838,"This study aims at determining the effect of masonry as an infill on the vulnerability of reinforced concrete frame buildings by using fragility assessment. Refined linear and nonlinear structural models were developed, from data collected through professional surveys, using the PERFORM-3D platform. Nonlinear–static and dynamic–analyses were carried out, for fifteen ground motions, to examine the plastic behavior of the models. Subsequently, the vulnerability was assessed using fragility relationships. The fragility parameters were determined by employing the Maximum Likelihood Method (MLM). The results indicated a decrease in the probability of exceedance for specific damage states of the structures with respect to seismic intensity for masonry infill frames. From fragility curves, it is concluded that although the use of masonry as an infill temporarily enhances the capacity of Reinforced Concrete (RC) Frame buildings as the probability of exceedance for masonry infilled RC frames is significantly reduced due to the increase in the overall stiffness of the structure. © 2021 Korea Institute for Structural Maintenance and Inspection.",Effect of masonry infill on analytical fragility response of RC frame school buildings in high seismic zone,2021,fragility curves; maximum likelihood method; Nonlinear analysis; vulnerability,None,0,1
12875,"Over the past 40 years, approximately 1/3 of the existing empirical fragility curves estimated the ground motion intensity at the needed locations from GMPEs. These studies typically ignored the error in the GMPE. This study develops a Bayesian methodology in order to explicitly model this source of uncertainty and assess its importance on the shape of the fragility curves. The methodology is used to construct empirical fragility curves for the least vulnerable Italian buildings using 7,439 data from the 1980 Irpinia database aggregated in 41 municipalities. Overall, the results do not show a systematic notable impact on the fragility curves for all examined damage states. Nonetheless, the shape of the fragility curves corresponding to the most extreme damage level (i.e., collapse) is substantially influenced by the explicit modelling of the uncertainty in ground motion intensity. © 2018 11th National Conference on Earthquake Engineering 2018, NCEE 2018: Integrating Science, Engineering, and Policy.

12884,"Fragility functions define the probability of meeting or exceeding some damage measure (DM) for a given level of engineering demand (e.g.,base shear) or hazard intensity measure (IM; e.g.,wind speed, and peak ground acceleration). Empirical fragility functions specifically refer to fragility functions that are developed from posthazard damage assessments, and, as such, they define the performance of structures or systems as they exist in use and under true natural hazard loading. This paper describes major sources of epistemic uncertainty in empirical fragility functions for building performance under natural hazard loading, and develops and demonstrates methods for quantifying these uncertainties using Monte Carlo simulation methods. Uncertainties are demonstrated using a dataset of 1,241 residential structures damaged in the May 22, 2011, Joplin, Missouri, tornado. Uncertainties in the intensity measure (wind speed) estimates were the largest contributors to the overall uncertainty in the empirical fragility functions. With a sufficient number of samples, uncertainties because of potential misclassification of the observed damage levels and sampling error were relatively small. The methods for quantifying uncertainty in empirical fragility functions are demonstrated using tornado damage observations, but are applicable to any other natural hazard as well.

12974,"Probabilistic assessment of seismic damage for an individual building or a building stock in terms of fragility curves generally requires utilization of ground motion records either seismologically consistent with the probable hazard for the area studied or chosen arbitrarily without considering the seismological characteristics, but covering a range of intensity levels. In both alternatives, the analyst should select several records to be able to perform the probabilistic studies accurately. This condition might not be always satisfied for regions where there are limited number of seismologically consistent records available or for cases when there are less number of records available for high intensity levels. To compensate for this, regional-specific stochastically simulated ground motions could be utilized. This study evaluates the suitability of simulated records in development of fragility curves for low- to mid-rise reinforced concrete moment-resisting frames sampled from existing buildings of Duzce, Turkey. The simulated records have been generated by using regional seismicity parameters of Duzce and employing stochastic finite-fault methodology. From the set of simulated records, a subset of 100 ground motion records have been selected to cover a wide range of ASI* values where ASI* is the modified version of ASI with 0.1-2.5 s range. To test the performance of the simulated records, a set of 'real' records compatible with the seismological characteristics of the region was selected from NGA-West2 ground motion database of PEER as well. Nonlinear time history analyses on multi-degree-of-freedom systems have been performed and fragility curves based on ASI*, PGV and HI have been developed.

12977,"In the conventional performance-based earthquake engineering framework, fragility curves are mapped to a function of story drift ratio or spectral acceleration corresponding to the first mode. Based on the fragility curves, the probability of structural healthy status can be estimated. Practically, it is difficult to measure story drift and expensive to develop an automative measuring system. Therefore, this paper strives to develop fragility curves by using wavelet-based refined damage-sensitive feature (rDSF), considering higher mode contributions. These fragility curves can be obtained from absolute acceleration responses recorded at each story of buildings. As irregularities have important and significant effects on behaviour and seismic performance of Moment Resisting Frames (MRFs) especially in the field of structural health monitoring, in the next step, we extend the fragility curves for irregular MRFs. To this end, an efficient and more precise rDSF using Morlet and cmorfb-fc wavelets are extended to map fragility curves. The correlation coefficient between rDSF and maximum story drift ratio is evaluated as a criterion to determine the effects of irregularity. The 6-story steel benchmark MRF was manufactured to consider a stiffness reduction irregularity caused by the deference in story height and ductility of beam-column members. To assemble rDSFs, acceleration responses recorded both from the regular and irregular MRFs were analyzed by using incremental dynamic analysis, subjected to different ground motion sets. Moreover, a system identification method is used to identify the natural frequencies of each MRF. Based on the acquired results, it can be concluded that the MRFs including higher first story and weak columns-strong beams changes with a higher probability of damages lead to damage occurrence at lower seismic intensities and also lower maximum story drift ratios as compared with those of reference MRF. Moreover, the results show that the fragility curves estimated by wavelets-based rDSF, especially by using cmorfb-fc wavelet-based rDSF, due to lower probability of damages (varied between 27% and 81% for different damage states) have more efficiency than the fragility curves derived from Morlet wavelet-based DSF, considering only the first mode, for all the MRFs of interest. Furthermore, global fragility curves lead to a total assessment of the MRFs, while for a more accurate damage diagnosis, the rDSF-base fragility curves computed for each story can be used. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Fragility curves for seismic damage assessment in regular and irregular MRFs using improved wavelet-based damage index,2021,Cmorfb-fc mother wavelet; Damage index; Fragility curve; Maximum story drift ratio; Regular and irregular MRFs; System identification method,Curve fitting; Earthquake engineering; Probability; Religious buildings; Seismology; Structural frames; Structural health monitoring; Acceleration response; Cmorfb-fc mother wavelet; Damage index; Damage-sensitive features; Drift ratio; Fragility curves; Maximum story drift ratio; Moment resisting frames; Regular and irregular moment resisting frame; System identification methods; Damage detection,0,1
12992,"Effects of different structural configurations, member orientations and standoff distances on blast-induced failure of steel frame buildings are investigated through development of fragility curves. Three steel frame buildings with different geometric configurations - square plan with rectangular shape in elevation, square plan with pyramidal shape in elevation, and semicircular plan with equal area at each floor level - are analyzed under blast load. The steel frame buildings are modeled, analyzed, and designed for dead load (DL), live load (LL) and seismic load (SL) for the National Capital Region (NCR), India. Force-controlled static nonlinear pushover analyses are performed to develop the fragility curves for the buildings under blast load. Different orientations of the columns (I-section) are considered to investigate the effect on building fragility under blast load. The results indicate significant effects of the structural configurations and column orientations on the blast resistance of the building.

13070,"This paper presents a study to statistically characterize the joint earthquake-snow hazard and subsequently develop maximum interstory drift fragility curves for a series of archetype engineered light-frame wood structures. Of particular focus are structures built in moderate-seismic, heavy-snow regions. For these light-frame structures, the additional seismic mass due to the presence of roof snow may be significant. Although load standards such as ASCE 7 provide guidance on combining design loads when considering life safety (e.g., flexural and shear limit states), guidance is not yet available for other performance levels (limit states with specified nonexceedance probabilities), performance (rather than safety) based limit states or damage indicators (e.g., maximum interstory drift), and hazard levels other than those implied in life safety design (e.g., 2%/50 years). All of these are expected to become more relevant as performance-based design procedures continue to evolve and gain acceptance. Using Boston and Stampede Pass, Washington, as study sites, snow loads and earthquake loads were modeled as stochastic processes and simulation was used to construct the joint snow-earthquake hazard contours from which the joint snow-earthquake hazard at different hazard levels could be characterized. One approach is proposed for the selection of appropriate companion load coincidence factors considering multiple hazards for use in performance-based design. Finally, peak interstory drift distributions and the seismic fragility curves at different joint hazard levels were developed for a set of archetype wood-frame structures. The results show that the current strength-based design procedures are not risk-consistent for these types of structures. As an alternative, recently developed displacement-based design procedures may provide a more risk-consistent design methodology. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Joint Earthquake-Snow Hazard Characterization and Fragility Analysis of Wood-Frame Structures,2016,Design; Earthquake; Fragility; Hazard; Performance-based design; Risk; Snow; Structural safety and reliability; Wood structures,Design; Earthquakes; Geophysics; Hazards; Random processes; Risks; Safety engineering; Seismology; Snow; Stochastic systems; Structural dynamics; Structural frames; Structures (built objects); Wood; Wooden buildings; Coincidence factors; Displacement-based designs; Fragility; Performance based design; Seismic fragility curves; Structural safety; Wood structure; Wood-frame structures; Earthquake engineering; Earth Movement; Hazards; Reliability; Risk Assessment; Structural Design,0,1
13121,"Severe hurricanes in coastal areas have caused enormous human and economic losses. Furthermore, the intensity and frequency of future hurricanes may increase due to the potential impact of climate change. Due to common underlying climatological causes, interrelations may exist between successive hurricane events. This paper proposes a novel approach for modeling the temporal correlation in hurricane frequency and develops an analytical method that reflects this correlation to estimate the statistical properties of cumulative hurricane damage. The method provides a closed-form solution to the mean and variance of hurricane damage, and can be used to assess the impacts of temporal correlation and nonstationarity in hurricane events quantitatively. The applicability of the method is demonstrated through a case study of Miami-Dade County, Florida, in which it is found that the nonstationarity in hurricane events increases the mean value of hurricane damage over a future period of 100 years, while the temporal correlation increases its variance. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Modeling the Temporal Correlation in Hurricane Frequency for Damage Assessment of Residential Structures Subjected to Climate Change,2017,Climate change; Damage assessment; Hurricane; Nonstationarity; Residential buildings; Structural reliability; Structural safety and reliability; Temporal correlation,Climate change; Damage detection; Housing; Losses; Damage assessments; Non-stationarities; Residential building; Structural reliability; Structural safety; Temporal correlations; Hurricanes,0,1
13130,"Seismic damage of the structures normally begins at material level, develops at section, member, storey and structure levels, and finally ends at the global structural failure state. In order to study the damage evolution law of the structure, the deformation equivalent principle and generalized force-deformation relation are proposed. Thus, the multi-level seismic damage model is developed and shows consistent mechanical characteristic for every structural level. The multi-level seismic damage performance standard is proposed based on the general damage behavior of each structural level and generalized force-deformation relation. Furthermore, the limit damage value and critical performance indicators are defined. A normalized parameter is introduced to adjust the corresponding relation between the multi-level seismic damage model and performance. On the basis of extensive experimental data and numerical simulation results, the above relationships of each limit state are analyzed and the normalized parameters are obtained by numerical regression method. By the proposed multi-level damage model combined with performance standard, the calculated damage evolutions can correctly show the entire damage process and damage state for each structural level, which is a theoretical basis to reveal the inherent law of structural seismic damage performance. ©, 2015, Editorial Office of China Civil Engineering Journal.

13134,"In this paper, a procedure to develop fragility curves of structures equipped with semi-active tuned mass dampers (SATMDs) considering multiple failure criteria has been presented while accounting for the uncertainties of the input excitation, structure and control device parameters. In this procedure, Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) method has been employed to generate 30 random SATMD-structure systems and nonlinear incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) has been conducted under 20 earthquakes to determine the structural responses, where failure probabilities in each intensity level have been evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method. For numerical analysis, an eight-story nonlinear shear building frame with bilinear hysteresis material behavior has been used. Fragility curves for the structure equipped with optimal SATMDs have been developed considering single and multiple failure criteria for different performance levels and compared with that of uncontrolled structure as well as structure controlled using passive tuned mass damper (TMD). Numerical analysis has shown the capability of SATMDs in significant enhancement of the seismic fragility of the nonlinear structure.

13135,"This paper presents a procedure to develop fragility curves of structures equipped with TMD considering multiple failure functions. The failure criteria considered are maximum inter-story drift ratio as a safety criterion, maximum absolute acceleration as a convenience criterion and TMD stroke length. The relationship between intensity measure and responses of the structure was assumed to follow the power-law model, and a regression analysis was used to estimate its properties. A nonlinear eight-story shear building subjected to near-fault earthquakes was used for the numerical studies. Fragility curves using multiple and single failure functions for an uncontrolled structure and a structure equipped with optimal TMDs were developed. Numerical analysis showed that using multiple failure functions led to increasing the fragility when compared with using the single failure function for both the uncontrolled and controlled structures. However, TMDs slightly reduced the seismic fragility and have the capability to improve the reliability of the structure. Also, it was found that the fragility was significantly influenced by the values of the capacity thresholds of both the acceleration of the structure and TMD stroke length, which should be selected by considering the target performance and application of the structure and control device. © 2021, Institute of Engineering Mechanics, China Earthquake Administration.",Multiple failure function based fragility curves for structures equipped with TMD,2021,fragility curves; multiple failure function; passive control; tuned mass dampers,Outages; Structural optimization; Controlled structures; Fragility curves; Intensity measure; Inter-story drift ratios; Multiple failures; Near-fault earthquake; Performance and applications; Seismic fragility; Failure (mechanical),0,1

The implemented retrofitting techniques were adding RC shear walls (SW) and steel bracing systems. Simulation and analysis procedures were performed in a nonlinear platform. Models are designed based on ACI 318-14 and ANSI/AISC 360-10 for concrete and steel, respectively. Non-linear time history analysis (NL-THA), non-linear static analysis (NL-SA) and collapse margin ratio are carried out to evaluate the performance of existing and retrofitted structures.

Three different strong ground motions are used in the analyses by referring to the UBC 1997 requirement. The IDA curves are compared based on five performance levels; operational phase (OP), immediate occupancy (IO), damage control (DC), life safety (LS), and collapse prevention (CP). The fragility curves and the calculated CMRs indicated that the shear wall and steel bracing systems both provide good seismic improvement and are able to achieve strengthening solution targets for an existing building system; however, the performance of RC-SW system under seismic excitation was much better.

13202,"Reinforced concrete (RC) structures often remain stable under fire, but exhibit damage and residual deformations which require repairs. While repair operations and building downtime are expensive, current fire design approaches do not consider post-event resilience. The first step to enable predicting the resilience of RC structures under fire is to develop capabilities to model the damage of these structures after various fire exposures. This paper focuses on the prediction of the residual (post-fire) deformations of RC columns within a code-designed five-story RC frame building. Computational modeling approaches to capture the fire behavior of the columns are investigated. The models range from isolated columns with linear springs at the boundaries to full building model coupling beam and shell elements, with intermediate approaches. The analyses highlight the critical nonlinear role of the thermal expansion-contraction of the surrounding beams and slabs on the column deformations. Large transversal residual deformations develop particularly in perimeter columns, combined with residual shortening. This invalidates models based on isolated column or 2D frame. A parametric study of the residual deformations of RC columns is then conducted, with due consideration of the 3D restraints and interactions, to investigate the effects of different design parameters and fire scenarios on the residual deformations after a fire event. The results of the parametric study indicate that fire load density and opening factor significantly influence the residual deformations of RC columns, compared to the thermal conductivity of concrete and live loads. This research improves the understanding and provides recommendations for numerical modeling of the effect of fire on the residual capacity and deformations in RC structures.",Predicting residual deformations in a reinforced concrete building structure after a fire event,2020,Fire; Reinforced concrete structures; Numerical modeling; Residual deformations; Resilience,FRAGILITY CURVES; BEHAVIOR; STEEL; MODEL; COLUMNS; STRAIN; DAMAGE; SLAB,0,1
13235,"A computational framework for probabilistic tsunami risk assessment due to a mega-thrust subduction earthquake is developed and is applied to the 2011 Tohoku Tsunami from retrospective viewpoints. The uncertain tsunami source characteristics are represented by multiple source inversion models and their stochastic variations that are generated using the spectral analysis and synthesis method. By conducting Monte Carlo tsunami simulation, stochastic inundation depth maps can be developed, which are subsequently integrated with tsunami fragility curves to develop stochastic tsunami risk maps. The stochastic tsunami risk maps display spatial variability of tsunami damage probabilities for a building portfolio, reflecting not only possible tsunami scenarios but also uncertain tsunami resistance of buildings. The numerical results indicate that both stochastic tsunami risk maps and risk curves are affected by the local terrain features, proximity to major tsunami sources, and building characteristics (material type and story number). Consideration of different reference tsunami source models in probabilistic tsunami risk assessment are identified as one of the critical contributors to the overall uncertainty of the tsunami risk predictions.

13243,"In Japan, structural health monitoring (SHM) of building structures began in the 1950s, but, until recently, its widespread use was not realized.

13248,"Because property damage and loss of life owing to floods have increased in many countries in recent years, accurate assessment of flood risk is urgently needed for effective flood management. Improving the assessment of flood risk requires considering the impact of dam operation for flood control because dams and reservoirs play important roles in the assessment of flood hazards and associated damage. However, the impact of dam operation on flood hazards and associated damage was not considered well in previous assessments of flood risk. This paper focused on the quantitative assessment of flood hazard and risk, including the effectiveness of dam operation for flood prevention. The grid-based approach integrating the following was applied for analysis: (i) a hydrological-hydraulic model, (ii) a method considering the dam operation for flood control, and (iii) an assessment of flood damage. To assess the risk, flood characteristics were computed using the rainfall-runoff-inundation hydrological-hydraulic model, and flood damage was estimated by integrating the flood characteristics, flood damage curves, exposure characteristics, and property values. The risk was assessed by focusing on flood damage to residential buildings and assets and agricultural sectors for the largest recent floods and flood events with different return periods. This study considered the Bago River Basin of Myanmar. Results show that the dam operation for flood control in the study area reduces the flood inundation area by approximately 10% and flood damage to buildings, assets, and agriculture by approximately 40%, 60%, and 10%, respectively.",Quantitative assessment of flood risk with evaluation of the effectiveness of dam operation for flood control: A case of the Bago River Basin of Myanmar,2020,Quantitative risk assessment; Household damage; Rice-crop damage; Flood control measures; Myanmar,INUNDATION RRI MODEL; HAZARD ASSESSMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ESTABLISHMENT; AGRICULTURE; IMPACTS,0,1
13263,"In the case of huge tsunamis, such as the 2004 Great Indian Ocean Tsunami and 2011 Great East Japan Tsunami, the damage caused by ground scour is serious. Therefore, it is important to improve prediction models for the topographical change of huge tsunamis. For general models that predict topographical change, the flow velocity distribution of a flood region is calculated by a numerical model based on a nonlinear long wave theory, and the distribution of bed-load rates is calculated using this velocity distribution and an equation for evaluating bed-load rates. This bed-load rate equation usually has a coefficient that can be decided using verification simulations. For the purpose, Ribberink's formula has high reproducibility within an oscillating flow and was chosen by the authors. Ribberink's formula needs a bed-load transport coefficient that requires sufficient verification simulations, as it consumes plenty of time and money to decide its value. Therefore, the authors generated diagrams that can define the suitable bed-load coefficient simply using the data acquired from hydraulic experiments on a movable bed. Subsequently, for the verification purpose of the model, the authors performed reproduced simulations of topography changes caused by the 2011 Great East Japan Tsunami at some coasts in Northern Japan using suitable coefficients acquired from the generated diagrams. The results of the simulations were in an acceptable range. The authors presented the preliminary generated diagrams of the same methodology but with insubstantial experimental data at the time at the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE), (2018 and 2019). However, in this paper, an adequate amount of data was added to the developed diagrams based on many hydraulic experiments to further raise their reliability and their application extent. Furthermore, by reproducing the tsunami simulation on the Sendai Natori coast of Japan, the authors determined that the impact of total bed-load transport was much bigger than that of suspension loads. Besides, the simulation outputs revealed that the mitigation effect of the cemented sand and gravel (CSG) banks and artificial refuge hills reduced tsunami damage on Japan's Hamamatsu coast. Since a lot of buildings and structures in the inundation area can be destroyed by tsunamis, building destruction design was presented in this paper through an economy and simplified state. Using the proposed tsunami simulation model, we acquired the inundation depth at any specific time and location within the inundated area. Because the inundation breadth due to a huge tsunami can extend kilometers toward the inland area, the evaluation of building destruction is an important measure to consider. Therefore, the authors in this paper presented useful threshold diagrams to evaluate building destruction with an easy and cost-efficient state. The threshold diagrams of width of a pillar for buildings or width of concrete block walls not breaking to each inundation height were developed using the data of damages due to the 2011 Great East Japan Tsunami.",Rational Evaluation Methods of Topographical Change and Building Destruction in the Inundation Area by a Huge Tsunami,2020,tsunami inundation simulation; topography change due to a huge tsunami; wall; pillar resistance against tsunami; CSG dike,FRAGILITY CURVES,0,1
13270,"The definition of relationships between damage and losses is a crucial aspect for the prediction of seismic effects and the development of reliable models to define risk maps, loss scenarios and mitigation strategies. The paper focuses on the analysis of post-earthquake empirical data to define relationships between buildings' damage expressed as usability rating or as global damage state and the associated costs for repair (i.e. direct costs) or for population assistance (i.e. a part of total indirect costs). The analysis refers to the data collected on residential buildings damaged by 2009 L'Aquila earthquake. For different usability rating or damage states, the paper presents the costs expressed in terms of percentage with respect to the reference unit cost of a new building (%C-r and %C-a for repair and population assistance costs, respectively). In particular, the costs analysis refers to undamaged, lightly or severely damaged buildings classified according to usability rating (i.e. A, B-C or E according to Italian classification) or to five different global Damage States (DSs). DSs comply with European Macroseismic Scale (EMS-98) and derive from literature available matrices properly defined to convert empirical damage to structural and non-structural components into building global damage. The %C-r probability density functions and relevant statistics derive from the analysis of actual data of post-earthquake reconstruction process, while, to determine those related to %C-a, a deep analysis of population assistance types, person/month assistance cost for each assistance form, and a methodology to associate such costs to each building are herein presented and discussed. Finally, the paper presents a relationship calibrated on empirical data to directly correlate repair costs on a building with assistance costs to their occupants. The relationships between empirical damage and direct and indirect costs herein presented are of paramount importance because they allow reliable loss scenarios to be defined by simply using literature fragility curves (defined according to empirical or mechanical approaches) aimed at evaluating the probability of exceeding different usability rating or damage states of existing buildings.",Relationships between empirical damage and direct/indirect costs for the assessment of seismic loss scenarios,,Repair costs; Population assistance costs; Direct and indirect costs; Empirical damage; Usability rating; Damage states; Post-earthquake reconstruction process; Loss scenarios,REPAIR COSTS; RC BUILDINGS; RISK-ASSESSMENT; VULNERABILITY; FRAGILITY; DERIVATION; CURVES,0,1
13271,In the present study two popular approaches for the seismic fragility evaluation of RC buildings are considered. First approach is based on series of time history analysis and a power law representing probabilistic seismic demand model. Second approach is based on Incremental Dynamics Analysis to determine the median collapse intensity measure. The two methods are formulated with different assumptions and methodologies for evaluations. The fragility curves and reliability indices are developed for a typical four storeyed frame by both the approaches and a comparison study is performed. The both methods yield almost the same results at same total dispersions.,Reliability evaluation of RC frame by two major fragility analysis methods,2015,Fragility; Hazard curve; Peak ground acceleration; Performance levels; Reliability index,None,0,1
13282,"Since 1990, natural hazards have led to over 1.6 million fatalities globally, and economic losses are estimated at an average of around USD260-310 billion per year. The scientific and policy communities recognise the need to reduce these risks. As a result, the last decade has seen a rapid development of global models for assessing risk from natural hazards at the global scale. In this paper, we review the scientific literature on natural hazard risk assessments at the global scale, and we specifically examine whether and how they have examined future projections of hazard, exposure, and/or vulnerability. In doing so, we examine similarities and differences between the approaches taken across the different hazards, and we identify potential ways in which different hazard communities can learn from each other. For example, there are a number of global risk studies focusing on hydrological, climatological, and meteorological hazards that have included future projections and disaster risk reduction measures (in the case of floods), whereas fewer exist in the peer-reviewed literature for global studies related to geological hazards. On the other hand, studies of earthquake and tsunami risk are now using stochastic modelling approaches to allow for a fully probabilistic assessment of risk, which could benefit the modelling of risk from other hazards. Finally, we discuss opportunities for learning from methods and approaches being developed and applied to assess natural hazard risks at more continental or regional scales. Through this paper, we hope to encourage further dialogue on knowledge sharing between disciplines and communities working on different hazards and risk and at different spatial scales.",Review article: Natural hazard risk assessments at the global scale,2020,None,EXTREME SEA LEVELS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISASTER RISK; FLOOD RISK; PROBABILISTIC ASSESSMENT; INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT; FRAGILITY CURVES; BUILDING DAMAGE; DROUGHT RISK; EXPOSURE,0,1
13287,"This paper provides a risk-based assessment of the sustainability of structural design alternatives in hazard-prone regions. Little systematic research has been done to assess the economic, social, and environmental cost of sustainable construction in relation to hazard resilience or the impacts of hazard-resilient design on system sustainability. However, some studies have suggested that green construction practices might compromise the objective of the design of hazard resistance of a building, whereas others have highlighted that the impacts of natural hazard damage are unsustainable, given the costs of reconstruction and threats to public safety, among other consequences. This paper extends the performance-based engineering paradigm beyond traditional metrics of structural performance to quantify such sustainability metrics as monetary cost, embodied energy, emissions, casualties, and downtime. The upfront environmental and economic costs of sustainable design alternatives are then compared with hazard-induced risks, considering uncertainties stemming from the hazard, damage assessment, or sustainability analysis. The sustainability analysis is illustrated for both bridges and buildings sited in seismically prone regions, revealing the potential trade-off in upfront costs and lifetime sustainability attributable to hazard exposure. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Risk-Based Assessment of Sustainability and Hazard Resistance of Structural Design,2016,Bridges; Buildings; Environmental impacts; Fragility; Lifecycle analysis; Risk assessment; Seismic; Sustainable structures,Bridges; Buildings; Cost benefit analysis; Cost engineering; Costs; Damage detection; Design; Ecodesign; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Hazards; Life cycle; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Structural analysis; Structural design; Uncertainty analysis; Fragility; Life cycle analysis; Performance-based engineering; Risk-based assessments; Seismic; Sustainability analysis; Sustainable construction; Sustainable structure; Sustainable development,0,1
13297,"The article addresses the seismic vulnerability assessment of a typology of unreinforced masonry buildings constructed in Lisbon between the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries. The main architectural and structural features of these buildings are presented. This supported the identification of the main uncertainties affecting their seismic performance and the definition of classes of buildings representative of the typology. The seismic assessment includes the generation of fragility curves that combine the in-plane and out-of-plane response following different criteria and methods of analyses. The results put in evidence the seismic vulnerability of this class of buildings. Considering the earthquake-resistant code for Lisbon with a return period of 475 years, about 50% probability of having heavy damage and about 30% probability of collapse were estimated. The structural intervention on these buildings is urgent in order to reduce losses due to future earthquakes.

13339,"Present study is focused on seismic performance of torsion irregular building by probabilistic approach. Incremental dynamic analysis-based fragility curves are developed to cover various uncertainties involved in performance evaluation. Among different methods, regression analysis has been used to estimate fragility curve parameters. Torsion imbalanced building model from SMART 2008 project has been studied. Seismic performance is investigated by developing fragility curves for various damage states along global orthogonal directions. To see the damages at local level, fragility curves are also been developed for specified control points. From the study it has been observed that, for torsion imbalance buildings, shear wall is very effective in reducing the probability of damage, in distributing similar effect along orthogonal directions. It is also been observed that probability of damage at non-orthogonal corners is relatively significant than orthogonal corners. © 2021, The Institution of Engineers (India).",Seismic Fragility Analysis for Torsionally Imbalanced Shear Wall Concrete Building,2021,Asymmetric plan building; Fragility curves; Incremental dynamic analysis; Non-orthogonal corners,Concretes; Seismic waves; Seismology; Shear flow; Shear walls; Torsional stress; Building model; Fragility curves; Incremental dynamic analysis; Irregular buildings; Orthogonal directions; Probabilistic approaches; Seismic fragility analysis; Seismic Performance; Uncertainty analysis,0,1
13348,"Fragility analysis was conducted for reinforced concrete frame buildings in Canada designed based on the 1965 National Building Code of Canada as representative of pre-1975 era of seismic design practice. Two-, five-, and ten-storey buildings were designed for Vancouver and Ottawa, representing buildings in high and medium seismic regions. They were modelled for inelastic response time history analysis, with respective inelastic hysteretic models for flexure and shear. Software PERFORM-3D was used to conduct incremental dynamic analysis under incrementally increasing earthquake intensity. Probabilistic analysis of the results of incremental dynamic analysis led to the development of fragility functions, which can be used as seismic vulnerability assessment tools. The results are compared with those generated for frame buildings designed on the basis of the 2010 NBCC. The comparison indicates that the probabilities of exceeding performance levels are significantly higher for older buildings relative to recently built fully ductile and moderately ductile buildings, respectively. © 2018, Canadian Science Publishing.

13352,"Nowadays, performance-based seismic design is the focus of earthquake engineering research, in which the seismic performance of a structure is mainly evaluated based on seismic fragility. However, the role of Engineering Demand Parameters (EDPs) on the seismic fragility analysis of Steel Reinforced Concrete (SRC) frame structures remains unclear. This paper presents results on the effects of EDPs on the seismic behavior of a plan-asymmetric SRC building. For this purpose, a nonlinear finite element model of the SRC frame structure was numerically developed using the OpenSees software. This finite element model was then validated using experimental results. The peak interstory drift ratios, as well as the component-based and material-based damage indices, were accordingly employed as EDPs. This study additionally shows seismic fragility curves for an SRC frame structure. The achieved results for the mentioned EDPs were both compared and analyzed. The findings indicated that the EDPs play a role in the seismic fragility analysis for the SRC frame structures. The fragility curves based on a damage index could display the probability of exceeding the ultimate limit states subjected to different seismic intensities, and also showed a similar manner with those based on peak interstory drift ratios. It can be concluded that for an SRC frame structure, the results of seismic fragility analysis using the component-based damage index proved to be more cost-effective and reliable. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Seismic fragility analysis of steel reinforced concrete frame structures based on different engineering demand parameters,2018,OpenSees; Seismic damage index; Seismic fragility analysis; Steel Reinforced Concrete (SRC) frame structures,Composite structures; Cost effectiveness; Damage detection; Finite element method; Reinforced concrete; Seismology; Structural analysis; Structural frames; Engineering demand parameters; Non-linear finite element model; Opensees; Performance based seismic design; Seismic damage indices; Seismic fragility analysis; Steel reinforced concrete; Steel reinforced concrete frame (SRC); Seismic design,0,1
13356,"In Italy, the recent regulatory and legislative developments relevant to the seismic risk mitigation of the existing building stock aim to propose tax deductions and simple but reliable approaches for the quantitative evaluation of the beneficial impacts of seismic retrofitting. Nevertheless, currently policy makers need tools and models able to assess the seismic risk and the cost/benefit of the strengthening interventions at regional/national level in order to plan future mitigation policies and be aware of the effectiveness of measures taken. To this aim, this article proposes a heuristic vulnerability model for large-scale applications. Starting from macroseismic approaches widely used in Europe, fragility and vulnerability curves for masonry and RC buildings are calibrated using a specific procedure based on the new Italian ‘guidelines for the seismic risk classification of constructions’ approved in January 2020, namely the so-called ‘Sisma Bonus.’ According to the construction material, building type and number of floors, the developed curves are defined in terms of vulnerability and height classes. The derived vulnerability model can be used in exposure models which rely on poor census data. Finally, it is compared with existing vulnerability models and the comparisons are analysed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Seismic fragility and vulnerability curves for the Italian residential building stock,2021,Buildings; concrete structures; damage assessment; decision support systems; masonry; reliability & risk analysis; residential; risk management; seismic engineering,Building materials; Depreciation; Population statistics; Risk assessment; Taxation; Large-scale applications; Mitigation policies; Quantitative evaluation; Residential building stocks; Seismic fragility; Seismic retrofitting; Seismic risk mitigation; Vulnerability models; Seismology,0,1
13370,"Fragility curve evaluation using ground motions compatible with conditional spectra allows for ground motion selection with good consistency with the hazard. However, this evaluation requires selecting ground motions from a database, which is not straightforward. Moreover, it relies on a fragility curve fitting procedure, which may fail to give a solution. Lastly, it estimates the statistical uncertainty of the curve based on simple bootstrap resampling. This paper proposes a novel framework for estimating fragility curves with two major improvements. First, the proposed fragility curve fitting procedure is not iterative and does not require an initial estimation of the curve parameters, unlike the existing curve fitting procedure. Second, the statistical uncertainty of fragility curves is estimated based on the Fisher’s information matrix, which is a rigorous alternative to bootstrap resampling. Moreover, stochastic ground motions compatible with the conditional spectra are generated and used as excitations. This is a practical alternative, as it does not require a ground motion database for scenario-specific selection. Results obtained with the developed framework are compared to results based on existing procedures in a case study of in-structure components in an industrial building. We analyze cases in which our curve fitting procedure gives a solution more reliably than the existing. Moreover, the developed procedure for estimating the uncertainty of fragility curves leads, in this case study, to better estimations for the statistical uncertainty of the fragility curves. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Seismic Fragility Curve Assessment Based on Synthetic Ground Motions with Conditional Spectra,2020,conditional spectra; curve fitting; Seismic fragility curve; statistical uncertainty; synthetic ground motions,Fisher information matrix; Office buildings; Sampling; Seismology; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Bootstrap resampling; Industrial buildings; Information matrix; Initial estimation; Seismic fragility curves; Statistical uncertainty; Structure component; Synthetic ground motions; Curve fitting; ground motion; hazard assessment; interpolation; probability; reliability analysis; seismic hazard; uncertainty analysis,0,1
13372,"Performance of reinforced concrete frame buildings depends on seismic hazard of the region and vulnerability of the structure. Performance-based evaluation of buildings may be conducted through fragility curves developed for different levels of performance. Reinforced concrete frame buildings with 2, 5, and 10-stories, designed as moderately ductile buildings for Ottawa in Eastern Canada and fully ductile buildings for Vancouver in Western Canada were used to generate seismic fragility curves. The buildings were analyzed using PERFORM-3D software to assess seismic vulnerabilities. Incremental dynamic analysis was employed to generate fragility curves. Two sets of earthquake records compatible with uniform hazard spectra of 2010 NBCC were selected, where each set contained 20 records for each city.

13377,"4- and 8-storey reinforced-concrete frame buildings are analyzed under the suites of the near-fault pulse-like, and the corresponding spectrally equivalent far-fault ground-motion records. Seismic fragility curves for the slight, moderate, extensive, and complete damage states are developed, and the damage probability matrices, and the mean loss ratios corresponding to the Design Basis Earthquake and the Maximum Considered Earthquake hazard levels are compared, for the investigated buildings and sets of ground-motion records. It is observed that the spectrally equivalent far-fault ground-motion records result in comparable estimates of the fragility curve parameters, as that of the near-fault pulse-like ground-motion records. As a result, the derived damage probability matrices and mean loss ratios using two suites of ground-motion records differ only marginally (of the order of ~10%) for the investigated levels of seismic hazard, thus, implying the potential for application of the spectrally equivalent ground-motion records, for seismic fragility and risk assessment at the near-fault sites. © 2020 Techno-Press, Ltd.",Seismic fragility curves using pulse-like and spectrally equivalent ground-motion records,2020,Damage probability matrix; Ground-motion; Nonlinear response; Reinforced-concrete frame buildings; Seismic fragility; Seismic risk,Damage detection; Faulting; Hazards; Reinforced concrete; Risk assessment; Seismic design; Damage probability matrices; Fragility curves; Maximum considered earthquakes; Pulse-like ground motions; Reinforced concrete frame buildings; Seismic fragility; Seismic fragility curves; Seismic hazards; Earthquake effects,0,1
13384,"Existing research to predict seismic fragility of Reinforced Concrete Containment (RCC) buildings does not take into account the impact of its inelastic bidirectional interaction arising from bidirectional horizontal ground motions. Hence, this study attempts to present a reliable and feasible method for fragility of the RCC subject to bidirectional ground motions. Three bidirectional load histories due to inelastic bidirectional interaction are firstly introduced to determine displacement-based failure limits for this structure. Nine bidirectional earthquake Intensity Measures (IMs) are developed to perform the bidirectional Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA). For the selection of an optimum method for fragility under bidirectional earthquake excitations, three fragility analysis methods are conducted and their results are compared. Results show that the maximum likelihood method yields better fragility results than the other two methods. The safety factor method for fragility cannot get the aleatory randomness properly.

13397,"The construction of underground structures in Lisbon’s downtown, alongside with the fluctuation of the ground water level, generates settlement-induced damages to old heritage Pombalino masonry buildings. Assessing the potential damage caused by soil settlements to masonry structures is essential for adequate evaluation of their seismic performance and the definition of retrofit solutions. The seismic assessment procedures need to take into account the settlement induced damage and the non-linear behaviour of the masonry materials. This paper seizes a rare opportunity to join, in the same analysis, real settlement profiles imposed to well-characterized historical building typology, known as Pombalino, with the evaluation of their seismic performance simulated with advanced numerical models. Lisbon’s downtown settlements were measured for seven years. From these settlement measures, two settlements’ profiles and two settlements’ rate were identified. This paper presents the results of a study developed on a representative Pombalino building where these settlement profiles were applied to assess their impact on the initial damage and on the seismic performance of the building. The expected level of damage for a given ground motion intensity was estimated through the employment of numerical modelling and nonlinear static analysis, which has shown that damages induced by settlements can reduce significantly the global seismic performance of the building. The level of damage of the building at a global level and local level was studied. For the latter, the damage on structural elements is defined by the mean of the drift parameter, while for the former, the damages levels are defined directly in the pushover curve. This study assessed quantitatively the effect of the differential settlement on the seismic performance of Pombalino buildings and their fragility curves. The results showed the seismic action intensity needed to reach the collapse of the structure is roughly half for longitudinal configuration with the curved profile and nearly 1/5 for transversal shape with the linear profile, when compared to the building without differential settlements. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Seismic performance and fragility curves of historical residential buildings in Lisbon downtown affected by settlements,2020,Damage analyses; Drift; Fragility curves; Nonlinear static analyses; Pombalino buildings; Seismic performance; Settlements,Buildings; Groundwater; Masonry materials; Numerical models; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Seismic waves; Seismology; Underground structures; Water levels; Ground motion intensities; Historical buildings; Non-linear static analysis; Nonlinear behaviours; Pombalino buildings; Residential building; Seismic Performance; Structural elements; Damage detection; collapse; construction; ground motion; masonry; seismic retrofit; underground construction; Lisboa [Portugal]; Lisbon; Portugal,0,1

13489,"This paper presents a comprehensive review of methods to assess building vulnerability for hurricane catastrophe models. The review identified five main types of assessment approaches judging by the underlying methodology: past-loss data, enhanced damage data, heuristic, physics, and simulation. The applicability of past-loss data-only vulnerability methods proved insufficient for the diversity of situations insurance companies faced. Therefore, modelers complemented this method with engineering and meteorology expert knowledge; these are the enhanced-data models. Expert opinion and subjective probabilities drive the heuristic models; these were short lived in the United States, but are still used when data are scarce. Component-based methods were developed as a more realistic alternative to enhanced-data models by assessing vulnerability within an engineering framework complemented with expert opinion. Simulation models enhanced the physical models with a probabilistic simulation of the wind-structure interaction and more realistic assessment of the hazard. This paper also reviews some influential postdisaster studies utilized for validation. In addition, this paper presents a temporal and spatial map showing linkages between models.

13535,"In the framework of seismic risk analyses at large scale, among the available methods for the vulnerability assessment the empirical and expert elicitation based ones still represent one of most widely used options. In fact, despite some drawbacks, they benefit of a direct correlation to the actual seismic behaviour of buildings and they are easy to handle also on huge stocks of buildings. Within this context, the paper illustrates a macroseismic vulnerability model for unreinforced masonry existing buildings that starts from the original proposal of Lagomarsino and Giovinazzi (Bull Earthquake Eng 4(4):445–463, 2006) and has further developed in recent years. The method may be classified as heuristic, in the sense that: (a) it is based on the expertise that is implicit in the European Macroseismic Scale (EMS98), with fuzzy assumptions on the binomial damage distribution; (b) it is calibrated on the observed damage in Italy, available in the database Da.D.O. developed by the Italian Department of Civil Protection (DPC). This approach guarantees a fairly well fitting with actual damage but, at the same time, ensures physically consistent results for both low and high values of the seismic intensity (for which observed data are incomplete or lacking). Moreover, the method provides a coherent distribution between the different damage levels. The valuable data in Da.D.O. allowed significant improvements of the method than its original version. The model has been recently applied in the context of ReLUIS project, funded by the DPC to support the development of Italian Risk Maps. To this aim, the vulnerability model has been applied for deriving fragility curves. This step requires to introduce a correlation law between the Macroseismic Intensity (adopted for the calibration of the model from a wide set of real damage data) and the Peak Ground Acceleration (at present, one of most used instrumental intensity measures); this conversion further increases the potential of the macroseismic method. As presented in the paper, the first applications of the model have produced plausible and consistent results at national scale, both in terms of damage scenarios and total risk (economic loss, consequences to people). © 2021, The Author(s).",The heuristic vulnerability model: fragility curves for masonry buildings,2021,Calibration by observed damage; Fragility curves; Macroseismic vulnerability model; Mean damage grade; Vulnerability index,Distributed database systems; Losses; Maps; Masonry materials; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Seismology; Damage distribution; Expert elicitation; Intensity measure; Macroseismic intensity; Peak ground acceleration; Unreinforced masonry; Vulnerability assessments; Vulnerability models; Heuristic methods; detection method; masonry; peak acceleration; vulnerability; Italy; Matthiola,0,1
13536,"The March 2015 extraordinary hydrometeomlogical event in the Andes cordillera caused severe floods in the southern Atacama Desert. One of the most affected cities was CopiapO (northern Chile) located downstream of the junction between the CopiapO river and its ephemeral tributary Quebrada Paipote. This work analyses the features of this catastrophic flood and relates them with the identified impacts. A large volume of water mixed with fine sediments overflowed the tributary channel generating a flood that affected 72% of the urban area. The rheological (velocity, density and flow regime) and sedimentary features of the flow reveal the occurrence of massive mudflows that infilled the space available inside the buildings, buried the streets with a sandy mud deposit of more than 30 cm medium thickness and collapsed the sewer network. The post-event survey carried out by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning (MINVU) was used for the development of fragility curves that allows modelling the probability of damage. Results indicate that the greatest probability of building damage is generated by the accumulation of sediments instead of by the flow depth. On the other hand, once the very fine grain sediments of the top of the deposit dried up, it increased the concentration of post-event suspension particulate matter, causing a health issue. This work highlights the need to understand mudflow processes and their consequences in arid environments to improve urban planning and mitigate future damages since their impacts strongly affect infrastructures and communities.",The March 2015 catastrophic flood event and its impacts in the city of Copiapo (southern Atacama Desert).

13551,"Approximately 1,200 tornadoes impact the United States every year with a percentage of these resulting in significant damage, injuries, and fatalities. Initially, a probabilistic tornado hazard analysis was performed in order to develop tornado hazard curves at select locations across the United States. This analysis resulted in the annual probability of experiencing a tornado of any strength at the specific locations, which varied as a function of location-specific occurrence rates. Five different residential wood-frame building archetypes were designed at each of the locations based on current residential building code and/or practice. Fragilities for the roof sheathing and truss to wall top-plate connections were developed for each archetype. Because fragilities are independent of location, they were then convolved with the tornado hazard curves to compute annual failure probabilities for select roof components. This represents the first time absolute risk of roof failure due to tornadoes has been computed since the tornado hazard curve is convolved with the fragility curves. These probabilities quantify failure probabilities of residential wood-frame roofs to tornado winds. While this value is quite small for an individual home, applying this method to an individual city block or neighborhood can quantify a location's vulnerability to tornado wind damage. The Florida state building code is applied to other locations in the United States, fragilities are developed and convolved, and failure probabilities for these modified buildings are computed. The comparison of failure probabilities between local building code and the stricter Florida residential building code allowed for a quantitative assessment of strengthened construction practices for structures subjected to tornadic wind loads. Results indicate that stricter building codes may be beneficial in areas with a high annual tornado risk, such as Tornado Alley. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Tornado Risk Analysis for Residential Wood-Frame Roof Damage across the United States,2016,Convolution; Fragility; Hazard analysis; Residential structures; Tornado; Wood structures,Buildings; Codes (symbols); Convolution; Hazards; Housing; Location; Probability; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Roofs; Tornadoes; Wood; Wooden buildings; Annual failure probability; Annual probabilities; Construction practice; Fragility; Hazard analysis; Quantitative assessments; Residential structures; Wood structure; Building codes; Damage; Probability; Risk Assessment; Roofing; USA,0,1
13565,"This work describes the seismic vulnerability assessment of a railway masonry arch bridge. Its conservation state is initially investigated by means of a thorough field and laboratory test campaign, comprising destructive and non-destructive tests. Two different methods are used to evaluate the bridge seismic vulnerability. The first method adopts a deterministic approach and corresponds to a single non-linear static analysis, performed as described in the Eurocodes. The second method employs a probabilistic approach and considers the variability of the involved mechanical parameters (structure geometry and properties of the building materials) and seismic parameters (intensity of the action and site conditions). This method associates the probabilistic values of ground acceleration exceedance to the estimated seismic vulnerability. This is shown by means of fragility curves, which allow to take into consideration the uncertainty of the various components involved in the definition of the seismic vulnerability and display the seismic damage scenarios. Currently no code requires to perform this calculation procedure. In addition, this work compares the values of masonry mechanical properties specified in the Eurocodes with those obtained in an extensive investigation campaign involving more than one hundred masonry bridges. Compressive strength and longitudinal elasticity modulus are the relevant mechanical parameters investigated. The outcomes of this research can contribute to the development of a more efficient maintenance system of the masonry bridges belonging to the railway network. This has an important role when it comes to establishing the priority order of assets intervention. © 2018 The Author",Two methodological approaches to assess the seismic vulnerability of masonry bridges,2019,Bridge maintenance and conservation; Finite element analysis; Masonry mechanical parameters; Non-linear static analysis; Railway masonry arch bridge; Seismic fragility,Arches; Codes (standards); Compressive strength; Finite element method; Masonry bridges; Masonry construction; Masonry materials; Nondestructive examination; Railroads; Seismology; Static analysis; Structural analysis; Bridge maintenance; Masonry arch bridges; Mechanical parameters; Non-linear static analysis; Seismic fragility; Arch bridges,0,1

12507,"The simplified mechanical method POST (PushOver on Shear Type models) for seismic vulnerability assessment of RC buildings is used in this study to derive damage scenarios for a database of 7597 RC buildings subjected to the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake. POST allows the evaluation of fragility curves through the determination of the non-linear static response of RC buildings in closed form, assuming the hypothesis of shear type behaviour, and considering the influence of infill panels both in the derivation of structural response and in assessment of building damage, which is defined according to the European Macroseismic Scale EMS-98. The aim of the present study is to provide a much more significant and reliable validation of the methodology, thanks to a much wider database compared to previous studies, and based on a different application of the methodology, i.e. at building class-level instead of single building-level. To this aim, the main geometrical-typological characteristics of the analysed buildings (number of storeys, age of construction, building area) have been statistically characterized based on data collected from post-earthquake AeDES survey forms, considering both the variability of each single parameter and the correlation that exists between one parameter and the other. This also allows to analyse the effectiveness of the adopted analytical procedure in predicting the general trends of observed damage with these parameters, showing a good agreement between observed and predicted trends. The overall predicted damage scenarios are compared with the corresponding observed ones, collected from AeDES survey forms, highlighting, again, a good agreement. Finally, the assumed mechanical interpretation of damage classification of EMS-98 is validated through the comparison between the distributions of damage to vertical structures and infill panels and the corresponding observed post-earthquake damage data.",A class-oriented mechanical approach for seismic damage assessment of RC buildings subjected to the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake,2018,2009 L'Aquila earthquake; RC buildings; Mechanical; Seismic fragility; Damage States; Post-earthquake,REINFORCED-CONCRETE FRAMES; VULNERABILITY; STRENGTH,0,1
12511,"In a cross-disciplinary study, we carried out an extensive literature review to increase understanding of vulnerability indicators used in the disciplines of earthquake and flood vulnerability assessments. We provide insights into potential improvements in both fields by identifying and comparing quantitative vulnerability indicators grouped into physical and social categories. Next, a selection of index and curve-based vulnerability models that use these indicators are described, comparing several characteristics such as temporal and spatial aspects. Earthquake vulnerability methods traditionally have a strong focus on object-based physical attributes used in vulnerability curve-based models, while flood vulnerability studies focus more on indicators applied to aggregated land-use classes in curve-based models. In assessing the differences and similarities between indicators used in earthquake and flood vulnerability models, we only include models that separately assess either of the two hazard types. Flood vulnerability studies could be improved using approaches from earthquake studies, such as developing object-based physical vulnerability curve assessments and incorporating time-of-the-day-based building occupation patterns. Likewise, earthquake assessments could learn from flood studies by refining their selection of social vulnerability indicators. Based on the lessons obtained in this study, we recommend future studies for exploring risk assessment methodologies across different hazard types.",A comparison of flood and earthquake vulnerability assessment indicators,2017,None,DISASTER RISK REDUCTION; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER-FLOODS; DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; GLOBAL EXPOSURE; SEISMIC RISK; FRAMEWORK; HAZARD; MODEL,0,1
12514,"The potential for automated construction quality inspection, construction progress tracking and post-earthquake damage assessment drives research in interpretation of remote sensing data and compilation of semantic models of buildings in different states. However, research efforts are often hampered by a lack of full-scale datasets. This is particularly the case for earthquake damage assessment research, where acquisition of scans is restricted by scarcity of access to post-earthquake sites. To solve this problem, we have developed a procedure for compiling digital specimens in both pre- and post-event states and for generating synthetic data equivalent to which would result from laser scanning in the field. The procedure is validated by comparing the physical and synthetic scans of a damaged beam. Interpretation of the beam damage from the synthetic data demonstrates the feasibility of using this procedure to replace physical specimens with digital models for experimentation and for other civil engineering applications. © 2015 ASCE.",A computational procedure for generating specimens of BIM and point cloud data for building change detection,2015,BIM; Change detection; Computational procedure; Damage assessment; Laser scanning,Architectural design; Digital storage; Earthquakes; Laser applications; Remote sensing; Semantics; Automated construction; Building change detection; Change detection; Civil engineering applications; Computational procedures; Construction progress tracking; Damage assessments; Laser scanning; Damage detection,0,1
12515,"Recent unprecedented events have highlighted that the existing approach to managing flood risk is inadequate for complex urban systems because of its overreliance on simplistic methods at coarse-resolution large scales, lack of model physicality using loose hydrologic-hydraulic coupling, and absence of urban water infrastructure at large scales. Distributed models are a potential alternative as they can capture the complex nature of these events through simultaneous tracking of hydrologic and hydrodynamic processes. However, their application to large-scale flood mapping and forecasting remains challenging without compromising on spatiotemporal resolution, spatial scale, model accuracy, and local-scale hydrodynamics. Therefore, it is essential to develop techniques that can address these issues in urban systems while maximizing computational efficiency and maintaining accuracy at large scales. This study presents a physically based but computationally efficient approach for large-scale (area &gt; 103 km2) flood modeling of extreme events using a distributed model called Interconnected Channel and Pond Routing. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with a hyperresolution-fixed-mesh model at 60-m resolution. Application of the proposed approach reduces the number of computational elements by 80% and the simulation time for Hurricane Harvey by approximately 4.5 times when compared to the fixed-resolution model. The results show that the proposed approach can simulate the flood stages and depths across multiple gages with a high accuracy (R2 &gt; 0.8). Comparison with Federal Emergency Management Agency building damage assessment data shows a correlation greater than 95% in predicting spatially distributed flooded locations. Finally, the proposed approach can estimate flood stages directly from rainfall for ungaged streams. ©2019. American Geophysical Union.

12516,"In recent years, many studies were been carried out in order to understanding and later mitigate the seismic risk. Several important projects have been funded, different methodologies have been developed; in particular, for emergencies management several application have been carried out with good results. On the contrary, mitigation and prevention of seismic risk could be more efficient by setting a careful assessment, maintenance and retrofitting of the built. In this sense, it to be noted that the seismic capacities of existing RC buildings have shown a key role in recent seismic events (e.g. Southern Italy 1980, Turkey 1999, L'Aquila 2009, Lorca, 2011, Emilia plan 2012). In particular, old RC buildings have often shown a poor and brittle behavior. Moreover, the low seismic performances of these buildings are the main reason of significant earthquake losses (in terms of economic, social and political activities) that can been considered generally as a direct consequence of physical damages on the buildings. About these important topics, it is the opinion of the authors, that quantitative models of fragility, referring to the most common types of buildings, have a key role in the evaluation process of risk and should been continuously improved. Therefore, in the seismic risk studies, a fundamental step is the development and use of fragility curves representative of the behavior of existing RC buildings. A significant number of proposals are currently available in the scientific literature. In this study, a critical review of existing different procedures for RC with Moment Resisting Frames (MRF) has carried out in order to highlight advantages and weakness of each proposal. A great variability in terms of geometrical, mechanical and structural characterization, structural modeling, method of analysis, scale of damage, parameters of seismic intensity and statistical procedure has been highlighted, and finally an optimal procedure of fragility analysis has been outlined.",A critical review of fragility curves for existing RC buildings,2016,Damage levels; Existing RC buildings; Fragility curves; Seismic risk mitigation; Structural performance,Buildings; Computational methods; Concrete buildings; Earthquakes; Risk assessment; Seismology; Structural frames; Damage level; Fragility curves; RC buildings; Seismic risk mitigation; Structural performance; Structural analysis,0,1
12517,"Based on the damage model under a monotonic loading condition, a new damage model is developed to predict the ultra low cycle fatigue failure of building structural steel subjected to seismic actions. The damage prediction model was implemented in commercial finite element software ABAQUS by using the user material subroutine. Then, parameters used in the damage model of building structural steel base metal, heat affected zone and weld metal were calibrated respectively through monotonic loading tests and ultra low cyclic loading tests of notched coupon specimens, in addition, the damage evolution laws at the center of notched specimen under different loading conditions were compared. It can be observed from the comparison that crack always initiates in the center of specimens, which is consisted with the test results. Finally, the damage model were applied to investigate the damage evolution of beam to column welded joints under ultra low cyclic loading history.

12520,"The aim of this paper is that the precise description of damage behavior is crucial to well catch the mechanical behavior of structures in the dynamic numerical simulation, and address the issue on the coupled plastic-damage constitutive model for circular steel tubes of reticulated shells under severe earthquake. Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) constitutive model established by Lemaitre is reviewed at the beginning. Then, an improved damage model for circular steel tubes of reticulated shells is developed based on Lemaitre's model by replacing the original damage evolution law with a new one suitable for circular steel tubes. In addition, we introduce the stress update process. In this procedure, the well-known operator split strategy, which leads to the standard elastic predictor/return mapping algorithm, is adopted to solve the evolution problem of the improved model. Exploiting user-defined material subroutine, the implementation of the model is achieved within software ANSYS using BEAM189 element. Finally, the dynamic response of reticulated shells under severe earthquake are numerically simulated with the proposed model and with the conventional Prandtl-Reuss model, respectively. The comparison results show that the consideration of material damage accumulation, on the one hand, may change the failure mode of reticulated shells from dynamic instability to strength failure; on the other, may reduce the dynamic ultimate load obviously.

12521,"Flood risk analysis is more complex in urban areas than that in rural areas because of their closely packed buildings, different kinds of land uses, and large number of flood control works and drainage systems. The purpose of this paper is to propose a practical framework for flood risk analysis and benefit assessment of flood control measures in urban areas. Based on the concept of disaster risk triangle (hazard, vulnerability and exposure), a comprehensive analysis method and a general procedure were proposed for urban flood risk analysis. Urban Flood Simulation Model (UFSM) and Urban Flood Damage Assessment Model (UFDAM) were integrated to estimate the flood risk in the Pudong flood protection area (Shanghai, China). S-shaped functions were adopted to represent flood return period and damage (R-D) curves. The study results show that flood control works could significantly reduce the flood risk within the 66-year flood return period and the flood risk was reduced by 15.59%. However, the flood risk was only reduced by 7.06% when the flood return period exceeded 66-years. Hence, it is difficult to meet the increasing demands for flood control solely relying on structural measures. The R-D function is suitable to describe the changes of flood control capacity. This frame work can assess the flood risk reduction due to flood control measures, and provide crucial information for strategy development and planning adaptation. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",A framework for flood risk analysis and benefit assessment of flood control measures in Urban Areas,2016,EAD (expected annual damage); Flood control measures; Flood risk analysis; R-D function; UFDAM; UFSM,adaptive management; computer simulation; cost-benefit analysis; disaster management; drainage network; flood control; flood damage; flood frequency; numerical model; planning method; risk assessment; urban area; China; disaster; exposure; model; risk assessment; risk reduction; urban area; city; flooding; prevention and control; procedures; risk assessment; China; Shanghai; China; Cities; Disasters; Floods; Risk Assessment,0,1
12522,"A simplified risk assessment framework specifically developed for built immovable cultural heritage assets is proposed. The framework addresses all the components in a risk analysis and can be used as a screening procedure for the preliminary assessment of a large number of assets with limited resources. Furthermore, the framework can also be used to identify cultural heritage assets that require a more refined and resource demanding risk evaluation. The proposed risk analysis framework falls into the category of qualitative methods and is based on an existing approach developed for the vulnerability assessment of critical infrastructures. The qualitative risk analysis of the proposed methodology is based on a set of structured assessment flowcharts that address the main components of a risk analysis: the likelihood of the hazard, the vulnerability of the asset to the hazard, the consequences of the hazard, the loss of value of the asset and the capacity to recover from the event. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed methodology, an application example is also presented for the case of seismic risk. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

12524,"Various duration definitions have been proposed to describe the effective strong motion duration based on a single component of ground motions. However, multi-component accelerograms are usually selected as the seismic excitations to evaluate the seismic performance of important infrastructures. Duration definitions able to consider the duration contributions from all components of ground motions are still lacking. In this paper, a general integrated duration definition for multi-component seismic excitations is proposed based on the existing concept of strong motion duration. According to the proposed definition, integrated bracketed duration, integrated uniform duration, and integrated significant duration are presented to measure durations for multi-component ground motions. Twenty as-recorded accelerograms with a broad range of durations are considered to investigate the correlation between integrated and single component durations. A series of nonlinear dynamic analyses are performed to quantify the influence of different integrated ground motion durations on several seismic demands (i.e. peak displacement, damage dissipation energy, and local damage index) of concrete gravity dam reservoir-foundation systems. In addition, the results also reveal the effects of vertical seismic excitations on the seismic response of concrete gravity dams and emphasize the necessity to consider vertical motions in seismic performance assessment of such infrastructures.

12527,"Seismic vulnerability assessment is a critical topic in disaster management. It is a complex uncertain spatial decision making problem due to lack of complete data, vagueness of experts' comments in addition to uncertainties in the numerical data/relations. This paper presents a new Geospatial Information System (GIS)-based multi-criterion decision-making (MCDM) method developed for predicting building damages prior to the occurrence of a potential earthquake scenario which considers different sources of uncertainty to make realistic assessments. The developed method suggests an approximate reasoning approach through using Fuzzy Sets theory (FST) and enhanced Dempster-Shafer theory (DST). FST handles the vagueness of the heuristic knowledge on 'importance weights of the selected criteria' and 'the relationship of the criteria with physical seismic vulnerability (PSV)'. The enhanced DST is used for fusion of the information by taking into account the reliability of the adopted criteria. The proposed method's applicability is tested on existing buildings of a municipality district of Tabriz, a historical and earthquake prone city in Iran. The implementation results confirm that the proposed method is a pragmatic, rational and simple model which reduces uncertainties of PSVA to provide realistic predictions essential for assisting planners and administrators with reducing future earthquake losses in urban areas.",A GIS-based decision making model using fuzzy sets and theory of evidence for seismic vulnerability assessment under uncertainty (case study: Tabriz),2017,Seismic vulnerability assessment; uncertainty; fuzzy sets; Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence; multi-criteria decision making (MCDM),EARTHQUAKE SCENARIO; DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; HAZARD,0,1
12531,"Seismic hazard mitigation is becoming an important consideration in planning for disaster-resilient cities. Seismic hazard and urban vulnerability are the two major factors in the assessment of seismic risk. Peak ground acceleration (PGA) and peak ground displacement (PGD) are the two major measures of seismic hazards, and land-use and building patterns characterize urban vulnerability. A set of pseudodata is generated by an earthquake-engineering simulation model for the city of Taichung, Taiwan, using twenty-two significant historical seismic events. A seismic damage model is first statistically estimated, relating monetary building damages to seismic impacts (PGA and PGD) and building inventories (residential, commercial, industrial, government). This damage function is then incorporated into a seismic land-use optimization model to allocate future land uses to the available land while minimizing aggregate seismic damages. Solving the model under the twenty-two seismic events and under different regional growth scenarios generates robust site rankings, pointing to priority locations for future activities away from the most severe historical earthquakes. These rankings can help decision makers allocate future activities under the uncertainty of both regional development and seismic hazard. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",A land-use allocation optimization model to mitigate potential seismic damages,2015,earthquake simulation; land-use planning; optimization; seismic hazard; urban resilience,computer simulation; disaster management; earthquake damage; earthquake engineering; land use planning; optimization; seismic hazard; urban planning; vulnerability; Taichung; Taiwan,0,1
12533,"SP-BELA (Simplified Pushover Based Earthquake Loss Assessment) is a mechanic based fragility methodology adopted in large scale vulnerability assessment for the definition of seismic risk and damage scenario. The method has been developed for RC cast in place [1], RC pre cast [2] and low vulnerability masonry buildings [3]. SP-BELA identifies numerically the damage limit states by checking deformation and stress limit conditions on the structural elements of buildings. The capability of SP-BELA methodology to represent the seismic performance of Italian buildings has been improved through a calibration process recently completed. By using data collected from observed damage in the earthquakes occurred in Italy from 1976 (earthquake of Friuli) to 2009 (L'Aquila earthquake), calibration coefficients have been computed. They have been adopted in order to define fragility curves for five damage levels (those of EMS98 scale, [4]) and for five vulnerability classes. SP-BELA has been adopted to define seismic risk and damage scenario of Italian residential and school buildings. In order to provide a user friendly tool to support decision makers during emergency management, a platform with GIS functionality has been developed. When an earthquake occurs, the WebGIS platform can evaluate real time damage scenario and seismic risk maps. The platform allows to input data of an occurred earthquake. The tool allows to define ground shaking scenario in terms of magnitude, epicentre position, depth, fault mechanism and attenuation relationship. The fault can be defined by starting from an Italian database, the DISS database (Database of Individual Seismogenic Sources [5]) of INGV (National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology). Alternatively, a new user digitalized fault can be input. The platform allows also the evaluation of real-time damage scenarios with ShakeMap. Finally, it enables to visualize in tables and maps the seismic risk calculated for different return period and time windows.

12535,"The research of a disaster chain can help to determine the mechanism of disaster and the mechanism of mutual transformation between disasters; but at present, a unified and comprehensive modeling mechanism for the disaster chain evolution process has not been formed.

12538,"This study examines the relation between maximum seismic displacements and residual displacements for reinforced concrete building structures. In order to achieve a reliable relationship between these critical structural parameters for the seismic performance of concrete buildings, an extensive parametric study is conducted by examining the nonlinear behavior of numerous planar framed structures. In this work, dynamic inelastic analyses are executed to investigate the seismic behavior of two sets of frames. The first group consists of four planar frames which have been designed for seismic and vertical loads according to modern structural codes while the second group also consists of four frames, which have been designed for vertical loads only, in order to examine older structures that have been designed using codes with inadequate seismic provisions. These two sets of buildings are subjected to various earthquakes with different amplitudes in order to develop a large structural response databank. On the basis of this wide-ranging parametric investigation, after an appropriate statistical analysis, simple empirical expressions are proposed for a straightforward and efficient evaluation of maximum seismic displacements of reinforced concrete buildings structures from their permanent deformation. Permanent displacements can be measured in-situ after strong ground motions as a post-earthquake assessment.

Based on this background, this paper discusses on the seismic vulnerability of masonry fortresses by means of an analysis methodology based on three different analytical procedures, according to an increased knowledge of the structure. As a relevant case study the Albornoz fortress, a 14th stone masonry construction located in central Italy, was selected. Initially, the strategy proposed to perform this task was aimed at testing and developing an expeditious and non-destructive procedure to evaluate both the seismic vulnerability and the main mechanical properties of the different masonry typologies. The macroscale structural behavior of the fortress was then evaluated through a nonlinear static analysis (pushover) and a more simple approach based on the kinematic theorems of the limit analysis. From this point of view, by comparing the capacity of the construction to withstand lateral loads with the expected demands resulting from seismic actions, these methods provided a highly effective means of verifying the safety of the masonry structure and its vulnerability to extensive damage and collapse. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",A numerical study on seismic damage of masonry fortresses,2018,Damage assessment; Fortified buildings; Historic masonry; Kinematic analysis; Masonry modelling; Nonlinear static analysis,Damage detection; Historic preservation; Kinematics; Masonry materials; Seismology; Static analysis; Damage assessments; Historic masonry; Kinematic Analysis; Masonry modelling; Non-linear static analysis; Structural analysis; building construction; collapse; masonry; mechanical property; methodology; monument; numerical method; structural analysis; vulnerability; Italy,0,1

The RiSEM project aimed at developing and testing innovative and expeditious methodologies (i.e. either without or with a minimal direct contact with the masonry building) to evaluate all the main structural features of the monumental buildings required for the assessment of their seismic safety.

The paper summarizes the analyses performed on one of the San Gimignano towers: the Coppi-Campatelli one.

12542,"Seismic shocks occur sometimes as a sequence, close in space and time, of destructive events of comparable intensity. In these cases, a significant portion of the damage to historical buildings can be related with the cumulated damage on structures that become progressively more vulnerable. This research investigates the specific increase of damage determined by a sequence of strong ground motions, focusing the interest on the out-of-plane response of 2 church masonry facades. The dynamic analyses were performed by a specific rigid body and spring model RBSM, which only accounts for out-of-plane damage mechanisms. Two idealized models of facade, each made of 2 different masonry bonds, have been studied by applying various sequences of recorded accelerograms. The results highlighted a complex relationship between the spectral content of the seismic shocks and the characteristics of the structures that change in the course of the loading sequence due to the development of damage. The Housner spectral intensity proved to be a reliable scalar measure of the ground motion destructiveness for these facades. Moreover, when considering a design-consistent accelerogram that causes a relevant damage pattern, ie, with a significant elongation of the effective first period of vibration, the numerical results indicated a possible spectral intensity threshold below which the occurrence of repeated seismic shocks, both before and after the reference design shock, can be considered as irrelevant. On the other hand, a catastrophic increase of damage should be expected when this threshold is overcome.",A numerical study on the cumulative out-of-plane damage to church masonry facades due to a sequence of strong ground motions,2017,cumulative damage assessment; dynamics; masonry; out-of-plane; repeated earthquakes; rigid body spring model,SEISMIC PERFORMANCE; REPEATED EARTHQUAKE; NONLINEAR RESPONSE; SDOF SYSTEMS; WALLS; BUILDINGS; BEHAVIOR; MODEL; STATE; VULNERABILITY,0,1
12546,"Probabilistic-based type of analysis seems to constitute a state-of-art approach for earthquake engineers. Such strategy is, in the analysis of potential retrofitting measures for a building (or typology), needed for the development of vulnerability or fragility curves. This information is recognized to be extremely valuable within the decision process, since it allows the evaluation of the collapse probability (or other defined limit state) of a given structure under a given intensity measure. The computational development integrated with the advent of proper working methodologies led to the increasing of research in the field. Nevertheless, the current numerical FE-based modelling approaches are still cumbersome for the dynamic analysis of the masonry behavior. In this scope, a novel stochastic methodology, based on the Latin Hypercube Sampling, using homogenization concepts for the masonry characterization and employing a discrete-FE based model is herein presented. Both running- and English-bond masonry textures are suitable to be studied, being the system uncertainty considered on parameters affecting the material, mechanical, geometrical and loading conditions.

12548,"The current research focuses on a numerical and analytical study aimed at investigating the efficiency of a steel-based reinforcement system suitable for existing masonry walls. The application of such a retrofitting technique, which consists of glued thin steel grids applied on both faces of a masonry panel, is reversible, cheap and easy to be executed and appears to be suitable especially for buildings with concrete slab or inter-stories beams to which the steel elements could be anchored. The study is based on a reference experimental test carried out at the Politehnica University of Timisoara (Romania), within the European FP6 project PROHITECH. The reference test provided the application of a constant vertical compression and cyclic horizontal displacements to an unreinforced brick-cement mortar wall in full-scale (1500 x 1500 x 250 mm), to which was conferred a double-fixed constraint condition. Based on the experimental evidences, a reference numerical model has been implemented in ABAQUS, by adopting a plastic-damage material and a macro-element approach for the masonry modelling. Hence, in order to determine a design criterion of the studied system, a comparison with the analytical formulations available in the current Italian and European codes for the unreinforced configuration is presented in this study. Then, a wide parametric study on the investigated retrofitting technique has been carried out by varying thickness and spacing of steel grid elements, as well as the geometrical ratio of the panel (height/length). On the basis of the numerical results, a capacity formulation has been proposed, which takes into account the steel distribution in the masonry panel. The obtained outcomes revealed that the strength increase achievable by adopting the studied reinforcement system could be compared to the efficiency of a reinforced masonry wall of new construction and it is strongly influenced by the geometrical ratio of the wall, as well as the steel distribution.",A retrofitting technique using steel grids for existing masonry panels: a numerical and analytical study,2021,Masonry; Shear walls; Cyclic tests; Retrofitting system; FEM analyses; Steel,PLASTIC-DAMAGE MODEL; SEISMIC RESPONSE; CONTINUUM MODEL; WALLS; BEHAVIOR; SHEAR; GFRP,0,1
12550,"A prompt and overall understanding of building damages following a disaster is critical, as they are closely related to casualties. As an important active remote sensing technology, synthetic aperture radar can be a valuable tool for assessing building damages in disasters, owing to its large coverage, quick response, non-contact, and independence of weather and light capabilities. Various approaches have been proposed for SAR-based building damage assessment with the development of radar technology and interpretation techniques. While providing numerous choices, these multifarious approaches also make it burdensome to ponder the applicable approach in a specific case, and to reflect on potential fields for further research. Accordingly, this paper hierarchically classified and summarized these approaches to provide a structured understanding of the research status in this field, for assisting in approach decisions and promising field considerations. First, depending on the pre-event data availability, the numerous approaches were classified into change detections employing both pre- and post-event data, and assessments applying only post-event data. Then, determined by the data resolution level and acquisition mode, the plentiful change detection approaches were further distinguished into block-unit approaches analyzing intensity, coherence, or polarimetry features, and building-unit approaches that simply generalize the block-unit approaches, or that concretely explore the detailed individual building features. The post-event data-based assessments, with relatively fewer approaches, were further introduced as methods exploring polarimetry or/and texture features. In each classification category, the principle was first introduced to explain the basic concept and essence of the approaches. An approach review was then provided by organizing relevant studies in a logical or structured way, to facilitate a clear understanding of the overall research status. Favorable parameters in each category were also summarized for easy reference and application in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",A review on synthetic aperture radar-based building damage assessment in disasters,2020,Block-unit; Building damage assessment; Building-unit; Coherence; Intensity; Polarimetry; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR),Buildings; Coherent light; Damage detection; Disasters; Ellipsometry; Polarimeters; Remote sensing; Textures; Acquisition modes; Block-unit; Building damage; Building units; Data availability; Intensity; Remote sensing technology; Texture features; Synthetic aperture radar; damage; disaster management; hazard assessment; polarization; remote sensing; synthetic aperture radar,0,1
12551,"Estimating earthquake losses is an important issue for many private and public bodies. As a major stakeholder, insurers need realistic probable maximum loss (PML) values to foresee the possible losses they would face after a major earthquake and also to calculate optimal insurance premiums. Insurers generally use fragility curves to manage their portfolio by calculating overall PML values. There are, however, serious impacts of risk based PML estimation on earthquake insurance rates, and in this respect fragility curves, which represent regional losses rather than individual losses, could lead to suboptimal decisions. In this study, a rapid earthquake loss estimation methodology, which can be used even by the non-experts in earthquake engineering without conducting comprehensive structural analyses, is proposed for single-storey reinforced concrete industrial buildings based on parameters determined after investigating more than 80 industrial building projects in Turkey. 384 analytical structural loss estimation curves were obtained via the non-linear structural performance analysis method proposed in the 2007 Turkish Seismic Design Code. To provide a detailed evaluation of the proposed methodology’s performance, fragility curves representative of the structural types and the design levels of the buildings investigated were also developed. Finally, total insurance premiums corresponding to PML values of the inventory buildings were calculated, using the two aforementioned estimation methods and others previously published, by addressing issues such as reinsurance cost, capital cost and profit. Results reveal considerable differences in PML values and eventually earthquake insurance rates for the buildings investigated between the risk based structural loss estimation method and the existing methods, indicating possibilities for improved portfolio analysis and management tools. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",A risk based PML estimation method for single-storey reinforced concrete industrial buildings and its impact on earthquake insurance rates,2015,Earthquake insurance rate; Earthquake loss estimation; Earthquake PML; Non-linear structural analysis; Portfolio analysis; Probable maximum loss,Earthquake resistance; Earthquakes; Estimation; Insurance; Office buildings; Reinforced concrete; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Seismic design; Earthquake engineering; Earthquake insurance; Earthquake loss estimation; Industrial buildings; Linear structural analysis; Portfolio analysis; Seismic design code; Structural performance analysis; Structural analysis; building; earthquake damage; insurance system; performance assessment; reinforced concrete; risk assessment; seismic design; stakeholder; Turkey,0,1

In this paper, the approach of multi-source geographic data integration in flood risk assessment is developed for evaluating the impact on buildings of flood disaster under given flood frequency. First, the inundation model is employed to obtain flood risk maps, including both the inundation area and depth. Then, buildings information is extracted from Landsat-TM remote sensing images.

12556,"Cementitious materials, mainly in the form of concrete, belong to a class of macroscopically heterogeneous materials. The building technology of mass concrete structures enables large-sized coarse aggregate to be used. The maximum coarse aggregate size, in conjunction with the mechanical properties of the interfacial transition zone (ITZ), have great influences on the mesoscopic crack path and the macroscopic mechanical behavior of concrete. Herein this study, based on some pioneering work (Stroeven, 2000; Rossello and Elices, 2004, Rossello et al., 2006; Elices and Rocco, 2008), the effects of varying the maximum coarse aggregate size and the ITZ strength on the global mechanical properties of concrete in direct tension are theoretically modelled from a mesoscopic point of view. The particle size effect behavior of concrete is analyzed based on the proposed theoretical method, and some general conclusions can be drawn as: (1) The degree of tortuosity of the mesoscopic crack path in direct tension increases with increasing maximum coarse aggregate size and with decreasing ITZ strength; (2) The fracture energy and the tensile strength of concrete increase dramatically with increasing ITZ strength; (3) For normal strength concrete, the fracture energy and the tensile strength decrease with increasing maximum coarse aggregate size, while for relatively high strength concrete, the trends are the opposite; (4) The properties of ITZ could significantly affect the homogeneity of concrete. High quality ITZ could make the mechanical properties of concrete more homogeneous and get a relatively high strength concrete, consequently a short characteristic length and a high brittleness number are resulted; (5) For normal strength concrete, the characteristic length increases with increasing maximum coarse aggregate size, while for relatively high strength concrete, it is fairly insensitive to the maximum coarse aggregate size. It is hoped that this theoretical method may be helpful in the study of size effect and in the design of concrete and future cementitious materials.",A theoretical method to determine the tortuous crack length and the mechanical parameters of concrete in direct tension-A particle size effect analysis,2018,Size effect; Maximum coarseaggregate size; Interfacial transition zone (ITZ); Fracture energy; Tensile strength; Characteristic length; Brittleness; Meso-mechanical analysis,ACOUSTIC-EMISSION TECHNIQUE; SELF COMPACTING CONCRETE; QUASI-BRITTLE STRUCTURES; HIGH-STRENGTH CONCRETE; COARSE AGGREGATE SIZE; FRACTURE PROCESS ZONE; PLASTIC-DAMAGE MODEL; HIGH-STRAIN RATES; FAILURE BEHAVIOR; CEMENT PASTE,0,1
12557,"This study focuses on developing a two-step procedure for estimating the seismic response of urban area through per building analysis. The objective of the procedure is to obtain maximum value of key parameters (such as inter-story drift) needed for damage assessment by analyzing the building models in different resolutions. The first step is generation and analysis of low-resolution building models using the software, Integrated Earthquake Simulation-Structure Response Analysis (IES-SRA). The second step is analysis of high resolution models (meshed with finite element beam and solid models) subjected to static and dynamic seismic loads. Parallel computing was implemented in all the tasks involved in the procedure to distribute the large computation cost related to preprocessing, analysis, and postprocessing tasks. Per building analysis allows for specifying specific structure types for a target area. Thus, the results of the procedure are expected to have already accounted for the local distribution of different structural materials. As a demonstrative example, we performed the procedure simulating a hypothetical earthquake with magnitude, Mw=7.2 in the target cities of Metro Manila. The maximum inter-story drift values obtained in both steps were gathered for postprocessing - which included analyzing the variability as well as predicting the damage states per structure type. © (2018) by Earthquake Engineering Research Institute All rights reserved.",A two-step procedure for estimation of seismic response of urban areas in the Philippines,2018,None,Computer software; Damage detection; Earthquake engineering; Engineering geology; Seismic response; Computation costs; Damage assessments; Different resolutions; Earthquake simulation; High-resolution models; Interstory drifts; Local distributions; Two-step procedure; Earthquakes,0,1
12558,"Reinforced concrete (RC) walls are extensively used to resist lateral forces in tall buildings as well as in the majority of medium to low-rise structures designed for protective purposes. In the framework of seismic performance-based design, where an adequate modeling of the lateral load versus lateral displacement relationship and a full understanding of the damage evolution are required, numerical models represent an effective tool to conduct nonlinear response analyses of such systems. For practical applications and for performing extensive nonlinear analyses, it would be desirable to have a robust yet simple numerical model that is capable of capturing the global and local characteristics of the response for different levels of damage. To this end, this paper presents a finite element-based model implemented in OpenSees [1] capable of simulating the in-plane nonlinear static and dynamic response of RC walls across a broad range of aspect ratios. The proposed model includes (i) the element technology, in which the state-of-the-art isoparametric elements are coupled with layered sections, and (ii) a novel plane-stress plastic-damage concrete material. A simple simulation-based method for determining the concrete material parameters is proposed. Model validation is conducted through a comprehensive comparison against experimental tests collected from the literature. Results show that the proposed numerical tool can be reliably used to simulate the nonlinear global and local response of RC walls spanning a broad range of aspect ratios (from 0.4 to 2.3). Moreover, model hysteresis damping is analytically analyzed to provide modelers with insight into the equivalent damping to employ when nonlinear and equivalent linear dynamic analyses are performed with the proposed model. Finally, an extensive parametric study comprising a total of 12,288 nonlinear simulations is developed to investigate the sensitivity of the numerically predicted response to changes in the concrete model parameters and gain insight into the factors that most affect the walls peak shear and dissipated energy.",A versatile numerical model for the nonlinear analysis of squat-to-tall reinforced-concrete shear walls,2021,Nonlinear RC shear walls; Squat-to-tall shear walls; Damage concrete material; Concrete parameters calibration; Sensitivity study,PLASTIC-DAMAGE MODEL; STRESS-STRAIN MODEL; ELEMENT; BEHAVIOR; STRENGTH,0,1

12560,"Cement mortar is a widely used construction material; its mechanical behaviour is affected by the proportion of its contents and external loads. Its health condition and damage evolution can be obtained by acoustic emission (AE) monitoring. In this study, uniaxial compression and AE synchronisation tests under different loading rates for cement mortar with different cement sand ratios are carried out. Considering that the specimen still has a certain bearing capacity after failure, the concept of critical damage was introduced to modify the statistical damage evolution equation, and the damage evolution equation was fitted by using AE energy data. Finally, a statistical damage constitutive model of cement mortar considering the compaction effect of cracks was developed, and the fitted results of the models were compared to experimental data. Results showed that the critical damage value of cement mortar is approximately 0.9, and the damage constitutive model under uniaxial compression can accurately describe the relationship between strength and deformation of cement mortar with different cement sand ratios and loading rates.

12561,"Historical churches, tall ancient masonry buildings, and bell towers are structures subjected to high risks due to their age, elevation, and small base-area-to-height ratio. In this paper, the results of an innovative monitoring technique for structural integrity assessment applied to a historical bell tower are reported. The emblematic case study of the monitoring of the Turin Cathedral bell tower (northwest Italy) is herein presented. First of all, the damage evolution in a portion of the structure localized in the lower levels of the tall masonry building is described by the evaluation of the cumulative number of acoustic emissions (AEs) and by different parameters able to predict the time dependence of the damage development, in addition to the 3D localization of the AE sources. The b-value analysis shows a decreasing trend down to values compatible with the growth of localized micro and macro-cracks in the portion of the structure close to the base of the tower. These results seem to be in good agreement with the static and dynamic analysis performed numerically by an accurate FEM (finite element model). Similar results were also obtained during the application of the AE monitoring to the wooden frame sustaining the bells in the tower cell. Finally, a statistical analysis based on the average values of the b-value are carried out at the scale of the monument and at the seismic regional scale. In particular, according to recent studies, a comparison between the b-value obtained by AE signal analysis and the regional activity is proposed in order to correlate the AE detected on the structure to the seismic activity, discriminating foreshock, and aftershock intervals in the analyzed time series. © 2020 by the authors.",Acoustic emission monitoring of the turin cathedral bell tower: Foreshock and aftershock discrimination,2020,AE damage assessment; Aftershock; B-value; Bell tower; Earthquake monitoring; Foreshock; Seismicity; ßt exponent; Structural monitoring,None,0,1
12562,"The seismotectonic conditions of the Iberian Peninsula trigger the occurrence of earthquakes with an occasional periodicity, but with intensities greater than VI on the European macroseismic scale (EMS). For this reason, local action protocols are required in order to efficiently organise the technical inspections that must be carried out on a massive scale after events such as the earthquakes experienced in the Spanish cities of Lorca (2011) and Melilla (2016). This paper proposes the development of a set of documents for the evaluation and diagnosis of the state of existing buildings and infrastructure regarding seismic activity in Andalusia. With special attention paid to residential typology, approximations have been carried out to the normative context, to general comparatives, to particular analyses of a case studies selection, and to complementary approaches. The results have led to the establishment of two specific protocols. Firstly, the short-term guideline enables the classification of damage and risk levels, and the determination of what immediate interventions should be carried out through the generation of a preliminary on-site report. This activity can be performed by architects and engineers with the help of a mobile-device application (APP IT-Sismo Andalucía). Additionally, a long-term protocol provides calculation procedures and constructive solutions for the improvement of the seismic behaviour of affected buildings. Specially designed tests demonstrate the validity of the protocols and illustrate the need for information and communication technologies (ICT) tools in the evaluation of architectonic technical aspects. © 2019 by the authors.","Action protocols for seismic evaluation of structures and damage restoration of residential buildings in Andalusia (Spain): ""IT-Sismo"" APP",2019,Automatic protocols; Damage assessment; In situ structural diagnosis; Mobile-device applications; Seismic restoration,None,0,1
12564,"Remote sensing data play an important role for the environmental monitoring because they allow to provide systematic information on very large areas and for a long period of time. Such information must be analyzed, validated and incorporated into proper modeling tools in order to become useful for performing risk assessment analysis. These approaches has been already applied in the field of natural hazard evaluation (i.e. for monitoring seismic, volcanic areas and landslides). However, not enough attention has been devoted to the development of validated methods for implementing quantitative analysis on civil structures. This work is dedicated to the comprehensive utilization of ERS/ENVISAT data store ESA SAR used to detect deformation trends and perform back-analysis of the investigated structures useful to calibrate the damage assessment models. After this preliminary analysis, SAR data of the new satellite mission (ie Cosmo SkyMed) were adopted to monitor the evolution of existent surface deformation processes and to detect new occurrence. The specific objective was to set up a data processing and data analysis chain tailored on a service that sustains the safe maintenance of the built-up environment, including critical construction such as public (schools, hospital, etc), strategic (dam, highways, etc) and also the cultural heritage sites.

12565,"The seismic response and strengthening of two complex monumental masonry churches located in Northern Italy have been investigated through an advanced macro-modelling FE-based approach. An extensive documentary research and several field surveys have provided a fundamental preliminary knowledge of the two churches. Detailed three-dimensional FE models with a damage plasticity behavior for masonry have been developed and non-linear dynamic analyses have been performed to simulate the damage distribution in the churches and to identify the most vulnerable macro-elements. The analyses have highlighted the effects of geometrical features and masonry coverings on the seismic behavior of the two churches. The examination of the results in terms of tensile damage contour plots, maximum normalized displacements and energy density dissipated by tensile damage has provided a thorough description of the seismic response of both the whole church and the different macro-elements. In this regard, the procedure utilized could be regarded as a general guideline to follow for a realistic insight into the seismic response and failure analysis of large complex masonry structures without box behavior. From the results obtained, a hypothetical strengthening intervention has been implemented in the numerical models of the two churches according to the Italian Code, in order to quantitatively estimate the vulnerability reduction. A decrease of both tensile damage and displacements has been observed for the critical elements of the two churches in the case of strengthened models. Moreover, the results have shown the importance of the presence of the nave masonry covering to increase the effectiveness of the strengthening intervention, preventing the out-of-plane mechanism of the nave walls.",Advanced numerical insights into failure analysis and strengthening of monumental masonry churches under seismic actions,2019,Historical masonry church; FE model; Failure analysis under seismic action; Non-linear dynamic analysis; Damage-plasticity modelling; Strengthening intervention,PLASTIC-DAMAGE MODEL; STRUCTURAL-ANALYSIS; 2009 LAQUILA; EARTHQUAKE; BEHAVIOR; VULNERABILITY; PERFORMANCE; MECHANISMS; BUILDINGS,0,1

12569,"We present a method for determining an initial assessment of tsunami risk, with application for two coastal areas of Oman. Using open source GIS and seismic databases we carry out a tsunami risk assessment using a deterministic and probabilistic approach based on worst-case scenarios. A quick and effective method for estimating tsunami run-up without the use of complex modelling software is an important step in disaster risk reduction efforts as many government and emergency response organisations do not possess the expertise to carry out or interpret tsunami inundation numerical models. Estimates of probable maximum loss were calculated using a simple method of building identification and a revised building damage assessment technique. A series of tsunami risk maps were created for the coastal settlements of Muscat and Salalah, with the aim of improving tsunami response. We find Muscat to be at far greater risk of tsunami damage than Salalah; this is due in part to Muscat's proximity to potential tsunamigenic sources and the cities current level of urban infrastructure. Whilst much of the infrastructure in Salalah is currently at low risk from tsunami, development pressures could lead to increased risk within the region. It is hoped that the assessment of risk may go some way to a government led disaster risk reduction strategy being implemented in coastal Oman. The methods detailed provide a cheap and efficient means to quantify tsunami risk in many coastal Middle Eastern countries, of which several have poor disaster risk reduction strategies. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","An assessment of the tsunami risk in Muscat and Salalah, Oman, based on estimations of probable maximum loss",2016,Disaster risk reduction; Oman; Open source GIS; Risk assessment; Tsunami hazard,None,0,1

These product maps have a rather high accuracy as they are based on high precision preprocessing results in spectral consistency and geometric, which compared with traditional fused and registration methods by visual qualitative or quantitative analysis.

The proposed algorithm is for the first time applied to a large-scale wall exhibiting multiple shear and flexural cracking.

12576,"Numerous debris-flow inundation models have been applied retroactively to noteworthy events around the world. While such studies can be useful in identifying controlling factors, calibrating model parameters, and assessing future hazards in specific study areas, model parameters tailored to individual events can be difficult to apply regionally. The advancement of debris-flow modeling applications from post-event model validation of individual case studies to pre-event forecasting that can be implemented rapidly and at regional scales is critical considering the fatalities and extensive infrastructure damage caused by debris flows that inundated a developed fan in Montecito, California, following heavy rain on 9 January 2018. In this study, we evaluated the tradeoffs between model accuracy and simplicity in the context of the need for a framework that can be used in conjunction with initiation models and storm predictions for rapid, large-scale inundation hazard mapping as a component of post-fire debris-flow hazard assessments. We used numerical (FLO-2D) and empirical (LAHARZ) models to simulate debris flows from one of the drainages upstream of Montecito that was burned in the Thomas fire in December 2017 and compared model results with field observations and building damage assessments collected immediately following the event. Initial testing demonstrated that LAHARZ can simulate channelized flow but is not able to replicate flow bifurcations or avulsions, which are critical aspects of flows travelling over populated fans. FLO-2D simulations matched well with observed inundation area data, but variably under- and overpredicted inundation height, deposit depth, and velocity. We found that FLO-2D and LAHARZ had true positive rates of 0.84 and 0.6, respectively, and both models had similar false positive rates (0.3 and 0.35, respectively). Our model evaluation framework allowed us to compare model results with detailed field observations and will serve as a platform for more extensive model testing in the future. © 2019 Debris-Flow Hazards Mitigation: Mechanics, Monitoring, Modeling, and Assessment - Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Debris-Flow Hazards Mitigation.

12579,"Climate change is expected to have a severe impact on cultural heritage in the future. This study presents the methodology developed during the FP7 project Climate for Culture, of assessing the climate change impact on collection objects in cultural heritage buildings. The main innovation lies in coupling new high resolution future climate projections with building simulation tools in order to predict future indoor climate and identify future risks in historic buildings. The case study is an intermittently heated wooden chapel in Croatia. The whole building simulation model of the chapel was validated using a newly developed method of accuracy assessment in the context of preventive conservation. Even though modeling intermittent heating induces limitations in the model, it can be used for computing of future indoor data. Future indoor climate data was assessed for possible risks of biological, mechanical, and chemical damage to painted wooden panels using the newly developed specific climate risk assessment.

12581,"Rapid socioeconomic development in earthquake-prone areas can cause rapid changes in seismic loss risks. These changes make it difficult to ensure that risk reduction strategies are realistic, practical and effective over time. To overcome this difficulty, ongoing changes in risk should be captured timely, definitively, and accurately and then specific and well-timed adjustments of the relevant strategies should be made. However, methods for rapidly characterizing such seismic disaster risks over a large area have not been sufficiently developed. By focusing on building loss risks, this paper presents the development of an integrated method that combines remote sensing data and local knowledge to resolve this problem. This method includes two key interdependent steps. (1) To extract the heights and footprint areas of a large number of buildings accurately and quickly from single high-resolution optical remote sensing images; (2) To estimate the floor areas, identify structural types, develop damage probability matrixes, and determine economic parameters for calculating monetary losses due to seismic damage to the buildings by reviewing building-relevant local knowledge based on these two parameters (i.e., the building heights and footprint areas). This method is demonstrated in the Tangshan area of China. Based on the integrated method, the total floor area of the residential and public office buildings in central Tangshan in 2009 was 3.99% lower than the corresponding area number obtained by a conventional earthquake loss estimation project. Our field-based verification indicated that the mean relative error of the method for estimating the floor areas of the assessed buildings was 2.99%. A simulation of the impacts of the 1976 Ms 7.8 Tangshan earthquake using this method indicated that the total damaged floor area of the residential and public office buildings and the associated direct monetary loses in the study area could have been 8.00 and 28.73 times greater, respectively, than in 1976 if this earthquake had recurred in 2009, which is a strong warning to the local people regarding the increasing challenges they may face.","An Integrated Method Combining Remote Sensing Data and Local Knowledge for the Large-Scale Estimation of Seismic Loss Risks to Buildings in the Context of Rapid Socioeconomic Growth: A Case Study in Tangshan, China",2015,None,HIGH-RESOLUTION SATELLITE; VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; URBAN AREAS; EARTHQUAKE; INFORMATION; IMAGERY; INTENSITY; SAR,0,1
12583,"Determining the structural behavior of masonry structures is a challenge due to their lack of homogeneity. The seismic behavior of masonry structures is especially complex. The aim of this study was to examine the structural behavior of Zaganos Bastion using both experimental and numerical methods. The Operational Modal Analysis technique, including the Enhanced Frequency Domain Decomposition Method, and the Stochastic Subspace Identification Method were used to illustrate experimentally the dynamic characteristic of the bastion. A finite element model was developed using ANSYS software in order that the dynamic characteristics of the bastion, including natural frequencies and mode shapes, could be calculated numerically. Seismic analysis was carried out using the 1999 Kocaeli earthquake ground motion record to determine the linear and nonlinear seismic behavior of the bastion. The Turkish Earthquake Code and its general technical specifications were used to evaluate the seismic results. The results show that the maximum and minimum principal stresses exerted on the masonry components exceeded the code requirements at some points, but in general the requirements for the stresses were satisfied.",An Investigation of the Seismic Behaviour of an Ancient Masonry Bastion Using Non-Destructive and Numerical Methods,2017,Historical masonry structures; Bastion; Seismic earthquake response; Operational modal analysis; Turkish earthquake code,EXPERIMENTAL TESTS; DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; CASTLE; CHURCH; TOWER; VULNERABILITY; PERFORMANCE; RESISTANCE; BUILDINGS; GEOMETRY,0,1
12584,"Building interstory drift (ID), which is a measure of the relative displacement between two successive floors in a vibrating building, is a key response parameter utilized in both seismic design and post-earthquake damage assessments. To this point in time, there has been no accepted methodology or sensor technology for reliable and accurate direct measurements of building drift. Indirect measurement of drift, through signal processing and double integration of accelerometer data, is fraught with challenges, particularly when inelasticity-induced permanent drifts occur. In this paper, recent developments toward a new optically-based technique for measurement of both transient interstory drift (TID(t)) and residual interstory drift (RID) are described. The ability of a newly designed laser-based optical sensor system to directly measure interstory drift is demonstrated through experimental and model-based evaluations. This sensor technology has progressed to the point where practical application is feasible as an enabling (SHM)-H-2 technology.",An Optical Technique for Measuring Transient and Residual Interstory Drift as Seismic Structural Health Monitoring ((SHM)-H-2) Observables,2019,SHM; Seismic monitoring; Interstory drift; Damage detection; Optical sensor development; Structural damage,MEMS-BASED ACCELEROMETER; STRONG-MOTION DURATION; SENSOR; DESIGN,0,1
12586,"Seven steel-reinforced concrete (SRC) deep beams were tested to investigate the shear performance, including peak loads, failure modes, mid-span deflections, and cracking patterns. The parameters include the shear span-to-depth ratio and the dimensions of the steel skeleton. The digital image correlation (DIC) technique was utilized for real-time recording of the in-plane strain and deformation. The experiment results show that the failure modes of specimens could be concluded as two forms: diagonal compression failure and shear failure. The DIC technique was proved to be efficient for tracking the development of crack patterns and recording the failure modes. The corresponding numerical analyses based on experiments were carried out and demonstrated to be a reliable method to simulate the shear response. Furthermore, the most significant parameters and their interactions were identified by finite element models parameter analysis. The steel skeleton height and shear span-to-depth ratio were the main parameters affecting shear capacity. A design formula based on the strength superposition method was presented. The calculated results were basically in agreement with the test results, where the mean and coefficient of variation were 1.04 and 0.09, respectively.","Analysis for Shear Behavior of SRC Deep Beams Based on Tests, Digital Image Correlation Technique, and Finite Elemental Simulation",2021,None,PLASTIC-DAMAGE MODEL; STRENGTH PREDICTION; SEISMIC BEHAVIOR; TIE MODEL; CONCRETE; COLUMNS,0,1
12588,"The Cyclone Testing Station (CTS) and partners have conducted forensic damage assessments in Australia following severe windstorm events for over four decades. The information collected is used for building science research that provides the evidence base needed for improvements to building codes and development of damage mitigation solutions. The Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) operate Rapid Damage Assessment (RDA) teams in the aftermath of major disasters (e.g. cyclone and bushfire) to collect and disseminate information on extent of damage to buildings in impacted communities. These data enables focused and coordinated response in the immediate aftermath of an event and better planning for event recovery. This paper explores the use of QFES RDA datasets in analysing the damaging effects of severe windstorm events. Two case studies are discussed: a supercell that hit Brisbane on 27 November 2014 and Tropical Cyclone Debbie that made landfall along the northern Queensland coastline in March 2017. Where possible, damage data are combined with hazard information (dual-Doppler radar horizontal wind fields) and their relationship is investigated. The analysis demonstrates that RDA data are not only useful in response and recovery phases, but also have value for research aiming to better understand building failures and reduce damage in future events. © AJEM Australian Journal of Emergency Management, 2017.",Analysis of rapid damage assessment data following severe windstorm events,2017,None,article; emergency health service; human; Queensland; telecommunication,0,1

Different levels of cladding panel damage are introduced and a specific cladding panel hysteretic model is included in the structural model and calibrated on available data from experimental tests. Numerical results from nonlinear dynamic analyses are elaborated in the form of fragility curves for the damage limit state and used to compare the consequences of different cladding behaviours on prototype single-storey industrial steel buildings used as case studies. The outcomes are also compared to a damage limit state derived from structural analysis adopting bare-frame models and conventional drift-based damage criteria.,Analysis of seismic non-structural damage in single-storey industrial steel buildings,2018,Damage limit state; Non-structural elements; Cladding panels; Steel structures; Industrial steel buildings; Seismic analysis,ROOF DECK DIAPHRAGMS; BEHAVIOR; FRAMES; PERFORMANCE; EARTHQUAKE; FASTENERS; WALLS,0,1
12594,"Given the growing spread of glass as a construction material, the knowledge of structural response must be ensured, especially under dynamic accidental loads. In this regard, an increasingly popular method to probabilistically characterize the seismic response of a given structure is based on the use of “fragility” or “seismic vulnerability” curves. Most existing applications, however, typically refer to construction and structural members composed of traditional building materials. The present study extends and adapts such a calculation method to innovative structural glass systems, which are characterized by specific material properties and expected damage mechanisms, restraint details, and dynamic features. Suitable Engineering Demand Parameters (EDPs) for seismic design are thus required. In this paper, a major advantage is represented by the use of Cloud Analysis in the Cornell’s reliability method, for the seismic assessment of two different case-study glass systems. Cloud Analysis is known to represent a simple and immediate tool to analytically investigate a given (glass) structure by taking into account variations in seismic motions and uncertainties of structural parameters. Such a method is exploited by means of detailed three-dimensional (3D) Finite Element (FE) numerical models and non-linear dynamic analyses (ABAQUS/Standard). Critical issues and typical failure mechanisms for in-plane seismically loaded glass systems are discussed. The validity of reference EDPs are addressed for the examined solutions. Based on a broad seismic investigation (60 records in total), fragility curves are developed from parametric results, so as to support a multi-hazard performance-based design (PBD) procedure. © 2021 by the authors.

12596,"Soil structure interaction (SSI) may affect significantly the seismic vulnerability of structures with several mechanisms that depend on the mutual effects of soil properties and structural characteristics. A probabilistic-based approach is here applied to evaluate the effects of SSI on the fragility assessment of two selected benchmark buildings: a Reinforced Concrete with Infill Masonry Walls (RCIMW) and a Reinforced Concrete (RC). Analytical fragility curves were developed by performing non-linear 3D numerical simulations with Opensees that implements hysteretic materials and advanced plasticity models for representing non-linear soil conditions and structural configurations. The effects of soil deformability and structural flexibility on the non-linear response of the system (soil-foundation-structure) were assessed and discussed by referring to four limit states (slight, moderate, extensive and collapse) with respect to the maximum inter storey drifts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Analytical fragility curves of shallow-founded structures subjected to Soil-Structure Interaction (SSI) effects,2021,Analytical fragility curves; Non-linearity; Numerical simulations; Opensees; Soil structure interaction,Concrete construction; Soil structure interactions; Soils; Walls (structural partitions); 3-D numerical simulation; Fragility assessment; Hysteretic materials; Seismic vulnerability; Soil-Structure Interaction effects; Structural characteristics; Structural configurations; Structural flexibilities; Reinforced concrete; analytical framework; computer simulation; infill; numerical model; reinforced concrete; seismic response; soil-structure interaction; structural response,0,1
12597,"A fundamental tool in seismic risk assessment of transportation systems is the fragility curve, which describes the probability that a structure will reach or exceed a certain damage state for a given ground motion intensity. Fragility curves are usually represented by two-parameter (median and log-standard deviation) cumulative lognormal distributions. In this paper, a numerical approach, in the spirit of the IDA, is applied for the development of fragility curves for highways and railways on embankments and in cuts due to seismic shaking. The response of the geo-construction to increasing levels of seismic intensity is evaluated using a 2D nonlinear finite element model, with an elasto-plastic criterion to simulate the soil behavior. A calibration procedure is followed in order to account for the dependency of both the stiffness and the damping to the soil strain level. The effect of soil conditions and ground motion characteristics on the response of the embankment and cut is taken into account considering different typical soil profiles and seismic input motions. This study will provide input for the assessment of the vulnerability of the road/railway network regarding the performance of the embankments and cuts; therefore, the level of damage is described in terms of the permanent ground displacement in these structures. The fragility curves are estimated based on the evolution of damage with increasing earthquake intensity, which is described by PGA. The proposed approach allows the evaluation of new fragility curves considering the distinctive features of the element's geometry, the input motion, and the soil properties as well as the associated uncertainties. A relationship between the computed permanent ground displacement on the surface of the embankment and the PGA in the free field is also suggested based on the results of the numerical analyses. Finally, the proposed fragility curves are compared with existing empirical data and the limitations of their applicability are outlined.

12598,"The point fixed glass facade system is popular and considered a more elegant facade option compared to the framed glass facade system mainly for storefront, walkways and lobby areas in buildings. Point fixed glass facade system is fixed to the support structure using special bolt fittings and structural spider arms. Generally, the racking performance of these systems is not considered at the design stage in low to moderate seismic region and the system may be vulnerable if there is insufficient in-plane drift capacity compared with the demand imposed during earthquakes and wind actions. A unique full-scale in-plane racking laboratory test on a typical point fixed glass facade system was conducted and a maximum drift of 2.1% was measured before catastrophic failure. Non-linear finite element models were then developed and benchmarked against experimental results. The experimental results and finite element analyses indicated that a significant amount of the drift capacity was attributed to the rigid body translation in the facade system connections at the built-in oversize holes provided for construction tolerances. In this article, the laboratory test setup and the experimental results are summarised, and the finite element modelling methodology and non-linear analysis approach undertaken using ANSYS for the experimental test are discussed along with number of parametric studies.",Analytical study of point fixed glass facade systems under monotonic in-plane loading,2016,ANSYS; facade systems; finite element modelling; in-plane drift capacity; point fixed glass,DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; BUILDINGS,0,1

12608,"There has been a long-standing desire to identify classes or groupings of buildings that exhibit similar characteristics in response to seismic events. Regional earthquake loss models, post-earthquake safety evaluations, and rapid visual screening of buildings for potential seismic hazards all utilize building damage patterns in some form. Difficulty arises in characterizing seismic building damage due to the inherent uncertainty in both the occurrence of seismic events and uncertainties related to building responses. Various trends in building performance, often based on building characteristics, are frequently listed in the literature. For example, older structures are expected to perform less well than those designed to more recent design codes; however, it remains difficult to characterize building damage due to the rarity and somewhat limited documentation of earthquake building damage. The earthquake engineering field, in its current state, is dominated by probabilistic and/or deterministic frameworks to approach this problem. Although both frameworks have yielded significant contributions to building damage assessment, they are limited in their ability to relate engineering parameters to physical building damage observations that are often expressed linguistically. Other theories under the umbrella of Generalized Information Theory offer different mathematical models and philosophical approaches to this problem. This research utilizes mathematical formulations different from probability theory for incorporating uncertain information in the context of building damage assessment. This research aims to investigate the following question: Does empirical evidence support suggested linguistic general trends of building damage from seismic events, and if so, can this empirically-based information be used to associate potentially seismic hazardous conditions to buildings in understandable terms by end users? To investigate these questions, tools within the domain of fuzzy classification and fuzzy pattern recognition are used with post-earthquake building damage data to determine the existence or nonexistence of building damage patterns. Data from the 1994 Northridge earthquake for concrete structures have been used to mathematically model linguistic building damage patterns based on important building features. A comparison of the damage patterns developed by the classification analysis included herein to linguistic descriptions listed in the literature is also investigated. Although the linguistic patterns are limited by the available data, the potential for systematically representing and processing of subjective assessments of building damage in linguistic form offers a powerful framework for modeling nonrandom uncertainties that are intrinsically different from probability theory. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Application of Fuzzy Pattern Recognition of Seismic Damage to Concrete Structures,2015,None,Buildings; Classification (of information); Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Concretes; Damage detection; Earthquake engineering; Earthquakes; Geophysics; Hazards; Information theory; Linguistics; Pattern recognition; Philosophical aspects; Probability; Seismic response; Seismology; Structural analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Building characteristics; Classification analysis; Earthquake building damage; Earthquake safety evaluation; Fuzzy pattern recognition; Linguistic descriptions; Mathematical formulation; Philosophical approaches; Structural design,0,1
12609,"Knowledge about the cause of differential structural damages following the occurrence of hazardous hydro-meteorological events can inform more effective risk management and spatial planning solutions. While studies have been previously conducted to describe relationships between physical vulnerability and features about building properties, the immediate environment and event intensity proxies, several key challenges remain In particular, observations, especially those associated with high magnitude events, and studies designed to evaluate a comprehensive range of predictive features are both limited. To build upon previous developments, we described a workflow to support the continued development and assessment of empirical, multivariate physical vulnerability functions based on predictive accuracy. Within this workflow, we evaluated several statistical approaches, namely generalized linear models and their more complex alternatives. A series of models were built 1) to explicitly consider the effects of dimension reduction, 2) to evaluate the inclusion of interaction effects between and among predictors, 3) to evaluate an ensemble prediction method for applications where data observations are sparse, 4) to describe how model results can inform about the relative importance of predictors to explain variance in expected damages and 5) to assess the predictive accuracy of the models based on prescribed metrics. The utility of the workflow was demonstrated on data with characteristics of what is commonly acquired in ex-post field assessments.

12610,"STORMTOOLS coastal environmental risk index (CERI) was applied to communities located along the southern coast of Rhode Island (RI) to determine the risk to structures located in the flood plain. CERI uses estimates of the base flood elevation (BFE), explicitly including the effects of sea level rise (SLR); details on the structure types, from the E911 emergency data base/parcel data, and associated first floor elevation (FFE); and damage curves from the US Army Corp of Engineers North Atlantic Coast Comprehensive Study (NACCS) to determine the damages to structures for the study area. Surge levels and associated offshore waves used to determine BFEs were obtained from the NACCS hydrodynamic and wave model predictions. The impacts of sea level rise and coastal erosion on flooding were modeled using XBeach and STWAVE and validated by observations at selected locations along the coastline. CERI estimated the structural damage to each structure in the coastal flood plain for 100 yr flooding with SLR ranging from 0 to 10 ft. The number of structures at risk was estimated to increase approximate linearly from 3700 for no SLR to about 8000 for 10 ft SLR, with about equal percentages for each of the four coastal communities (Narragansett, South Kingstown, Charlestown, and Westerly, Rhode Island (RI). The majority of the structures in the flood plain are single/story residences without (41%) and with (46%) basements (total 87%; structures with basements are the most vulnerable). Less vulnerable are structures elevated on piles with 8.8% of the total. The remaining are commercial structures principally located either in the Port of Galilee and or Watch Hill. The analysis showed that about 20% of the structures in the 100 yr flood plain are estimated to be damaged at 50% or greater. This increases to 55% of structures as SLR rises to 5 ft. At higher SLR values the percent damaged at 50% or greater slowly declines to 45% at 10 ft SLR. This behavior is a result of the number of homes below MSL increasing dramatically as SLR values moves higher than 5 ft and thus being removed from the structures damaged pool. Generalized CERI risk maps have developed to allow the managers to determine the broad risk of siting structures at any location in their communities. CERI has recently become available as a mobile phone App, facilitating the ability of state and local decision makers and the public to determine the risk of locating a selected building type at any location in their communities. © 2020 by the authors.",Application of STORMTOOLS coastal environmental risk index (CERI) to inform state and local planning and decision making along the southern RI shoreline,2020,And waves; Base flood elevation; Coastal environmental risk index (CERI); Coastal flooding; Coupled wave and surge modeling; Flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs); Inundation,None,0,1
12613,"WARED system is Internet-based software that automatically receives the seismic information from Iran seismic center (ISC) every 30. s. The information is processed in a few seconds and damage assessment maps of various parts of the city (such as buildings, hospitals, bridges, etc.) become available, in layered format, to rescue groups through system site. Rescue groups, in addition to receiving probable damage assessment from the system, are capable of loading their field observations of actual damages caused by the earthquake on their system. The system, through organizing volunteer groups of people, takes advantage of these energetic, motivated and capable aid groups to help the affected people.WARED system has been designed with three aims of reducing casualties, integrating aid assistance and sending necessary information to the municipal management and private voluntary groups (PVO), within the time-limit after the earthquake. This system has four main indicators which makes it different from other systems. 1. Ability to work with minimum information (magnitudes and locations of earthquakes). 2. No need to install expensive equipment (accelerometer). 3. The operationalization capability in a short time (6 months). 4. Localization capability for the complex and chaotic conditions prevailing in unprepared cities.Principles of information processing in this system depend on three main factors including the magnitude and location of earthquakes, the properties of the rocks and sediment the earthquake waves travel through, and the technical characteristics of the buildings (strength, age, type, and geotechnical conditions of soil, etc.).

Despite earthquake-induced structural damages to buildings, ground shaking can also impose critical effects on nonstructural components and systems in buildings.

For this purpose, four case hospitals that were somewhat damaged in the Chi-Chi earthquake (September 21, 1999) were investigated, and the component scoring system developed by the Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research in the United States was referenced as the basis for developing seismic fragility curves for the components in the EPSSs of the case hospitals.

Delivering an effective response requires quick and precise analyses concerning the impact of a disastrous event. With the current technological developments to acquire massive volumes of data and the recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, now more than ever, disaster information integration and fusion have the potential to deliver enhanced situational awareness tools for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief efforts. Given the aerial images of a residential building taken before and after a natural disaster, recent applications of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) work well when differentiating two types of damage (i.e., whether the structure is intact or destroyed) but underperform when trying to differentiate more damage levels. According to our findings: (1) including enough surrounding context provides essential visual clues that help the model better predict the building's level of damage and (2) learning the correspondence between the features extracted from pre-And post-imagery boosts the performance compared to a simple concatenation.

12619,"The impacts of floods on housing are increasing due to more frequent and severe weather events as well as the ongoing development of settlements in flood-prone areas together with the rising vulnerability of assets at risk. Therefore, the improvement of the resilience properties of buildings to better cope with flooding has become a key issue towards more flood resilient cities in European research in recent years. The implementation of flood resilience technologies (FReT) on the individual property scale provides a previously untapped potential to reduce flood damage to buildings due to insufficient transparency of their effects. To overcome this obstacle, the paper presents a four-step extension of a synthetic approach for flood vulnerability analysis to provide evidence on the potential effects of FReT uptake concerning flood damage mitigation. The proposed approach has been integrated in the GIS-based flood damage simulation model HOWAD to support the assessment of FReT alternatives.

12620,"In recent years, shape memory alloy (SMA) have drawn significant attention and interests among researchers and structural engineers for diverse civil engineering applications. Superelasticity, shape memory effect, and hysteretic damping, are the three major attributes of SMAs that make them ideally suited for applications in concrete frames. Among different compositions of SMA, Nickel-Titanium (NiTi) SMA has gained much attention for its superior mechanical and thermal performance over other compositions. However, the high cost and low machinability restricts the widespread use of NiTi SMAs in structural applications. Recently, several compositions of SMAs have been developed, such as Fe-based and Cu-based SMAs, which offer significantly lower cost and superior machinability compared to commonly used NiTi SMAs. The objective of this study is to evaluate the comparative seismic collapse safety of concrete beam-column joints reinforced with five different SMAs. The beam-column joint is assumed to be part of a seven storey moment resistant frame building located in Dhaka, Bangladesh. A total of 20 near fault and far field ground motions will be considered for developing the collapse fragility curves.

12622,"Earthquake engineering is a major consideration for structures along the west coast of North America. The current building code of Canada is based on design criteria, which are defined by stresses and member forces calculated from prescribed levels of applied lateral shear force. Traditional wood-frame buildings are known to perform well in earthquakes. However, with the development of new engineered wood products, such as CLT (cross-laminated timber) and more consideration to build higher than the existing six stories limit in wood-frame structures, highlights the need to use innovative hybrid techniques for buildings. Hybrid buildings with steel frame structures incorporated with CLT infill walls offer one possible solution to residential and commercial multi-level buildings to overcome the height limitation. In order to make such a structure applicable for an earthquake prone area, it is important to understand the structural performance of the connection between steel and CLT elements. In this research, six connection combinations have been tested and modeled in a finite element program. The load-displacement test results are assessed with two evaluation methods. The first method follows the American Society of Testing Method, where ductility ratio, elastic shear stiffness, and the EEEP-curve (equivalent energy elastic-plastic curve) are generated and assessed. The second method follows an energy-based accumulation principle, where the test results are used to calculate a damage index at each time step. Both methods are used to compare test and model results and assess the accuracy of the model as well as addressing the capability of each assessment method. Depending on the purpose of the model one or the other assessment method might be suitable. For an analysis of the overall ductility or elastic shear stiffness, applying the method provided by ASTM will give relatively accurate results to assess a hysteretic load-displacement model such as the SAWS model in this research. The assessment with a damage accumulation method is a great tool to capture more details of the hysteretic load-displacement curve. Energy dissipation is valuable indicator besides ductility and elastic shear stiffness to evaluate the model. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Assessment and comparison of experimental and numerical model studies of cross-laminated timber mechanical connections under cyclic loading,2015,Connections; Cross-laminated timber; Damage assessment; Damage index; Damage prediction; SAWS model; Seismic performance,Building codes; Building materials; Buildings; Ductility; Earthquakes; Elastoplasticity; Energy dissipation; Hysteresis; Laminating; Shear flow; Software testing; Stiffness; Structural analysis; Structural frames; Timber; Waveguide couplers; Wood products; Cross laminated; Damage assessments; Damage index; Damage prediction; Seismic Performance; Damage detection; Damage; Evaluation; Models,0,1
12623,"Climate change-induced floods in tropical urban areas have presented a serious global challenge because of failed conventional stormwater management practices. This research aims to develop a comprehensive methodological framework for flood damage estimation and mitigation, particularly in a tropical urban city. In this study, interdisciplinary fields were integrated through statistical downscaling, hydrologic-hydraulic modeling, and the development of flood damage curves. Relationships between tangible flood damage and flood-borne outbreak with flood depths were elucidated to predict future damage. Various flood mitigation strategies were evaluated. Herein, Hat Yai Municipality in Southern Thailand was selected as the study area. The flood simulation was conducted for 2010 and the highest flood damage sensitivity was exhibited by non-commercial buildings due to significant commercial stock damage, which was followed by that observed for detached houses. There was a strong linear relationship between the number of patients infected with leptospirosis and flood depth (R2 = 0.85). For climate change studies, flood maps for storms with 20-, 50-, and 100-year return periods under the A2/RCP8.5 scenario were generated using hydrological-hydraulic 1D/2D model; these maps were applied with the developed flood damage curves for damage estimation. It was found that reducing flood damage by implementing agroforestry and expanding the main bypass channel provides comparable damage reductions of −25.5% and − 27.5%, respectively, under the worst-case scenario of a 100-year return period in 2040–2059. Therefore, to deal with uncertain climate change situations, the incorporation of structural and non-structural measures is recommended. Such a combination when coupled with an eight-hour flood awareness time can result in a damage reduction of −59.9%. A flood warning system was in high demand by residents in the area; however, damage reduction from this measure alone was not high (approximately −17.0%) when compared to that obtained with other measures; consequently, additional measures were needed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Assessment and mitigation of tangible flood damages driven by climate change in a tropical city: Hat Yai Municipality, southern Thailand",2021,Flood mitigation; Flood-borne diseases; General circulation model; Hydrologic-hydraulic model; Statistical downscaling; Urban flood damage,Climate change; Damage detection; Hurricanes; Hydraulic models; Office buildings; Storms; Tropics; Damage curves; Damage estimation; Damage reduction; Flood mitigation; Flood-borne disease; General circulation model; Hydrologic-hydraulic model; Southern Thailand; Statistical downscaling; Urban flood damage; Floods; climate change; disaster management; flood damage; flood deposit; general circulation model; hydrological modeling; mitigation; natural hazard; research work; Hat Yai; Songkhla; Southern Region; Thailand; city; climate change; flooding; human; hydrology; Thailand; Cities; Climate Change; Floods; Humans; Hydrology; Thailand,0,1
12624,"The present study develops a more efficient method for the accurate modeling of nonlinear behavior of structural elements, being an essential ingredient in reliable assessment of collapse fragility curve, as an important issue in the performance-based earthquake engineering. To this end, beams and columns are often simulated by lumped plasticity models, consisting of one elastic element and two nonlinear spring elements at two ends to consider the effects of strength and stiffness degradation. Since introducing spring elements is obviously associated with the correct estimation of axial load ratio of each structural component during nonlinear dynamic analysis, the specific aim of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of any variation in the generated axial forces (axial efforts) in the elements on structural seismic response. For this purpose, fuzzy set theory has been utilized to assess the median of collapse fragility curves as fuzzy number by well-known α-cut approach. Then, herein, genetic algorithm has been employed to search for the maximum and minimum of this median in each membership degree α. Application of this methodology is illustrated through an example. It is shown that the primary advantage of the proposed assessment processes is to incorporate the influence of record to record variability, as aleatory uncertainty, and fuzziness in axial effort of the structural elements, as epistemic uncertainty, on the estimation of more realistic responses for structural systems with cyclic behavior and the evaluation of collapse performance of reinforced concrete buildings under seismic loads. © 2018 fib.

12626,"This paper presents an original methodology for the rapid assessment of potential building damage caused by an excavation. The combination of the Ground-work Impact (GI), in terms of induced greenfield displacements, and the Building Vulnerability (BV) form the basis for the GIBV damage assessment method. Both short- and long-term displacements are considered in the impact evaluation. In addition to short-term displacement due to undrained shear deformations, groundwater drawdown can result in significant consolidation settlements at considerable distance from the excavation site. In the proposed method for soft soil ground conditions, the short-term excavation-induced settlement is derived using empirical expressions and long-term displacement is estimated by coupling empirically-derived relationships for excavation-induced groundwater drawdown with a soil stratification model and consolidation theory. The building vulnerability is assessed by considering different physical characteristics and conditions of the buildings. The GIBV method has been implemented in a GIS tool to predict damage classes for buildings exposed to excavation-induced settlements. Two different case studies in Norway were used to test the reliability of the predictions of the tool and validate the methodology. A comparison between the predicted damage classes with the back-calculated ones shows a relatively high accuracy of the methodology. Moreover, the coupled model, which considers both impact and vulnerability for the damage assessment of buildings, has a higher accuracy and lower overestimation rate compared to the results obtained by just considering the impact.",Assessment of building damage due to excavation-induced displacements: The GIBV method,2021,Risk assessment; Impact; Vulnerability; Building damage; Deep excavation; Contingency table,SEISMIC VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; GROUND SURFACE SETTLEMENT; WALL CONSTRUCTION; MASONRY BUILDINGS; MOVEMENTS; PREDICTION; BEHAVIOR,0,1
12627,"In the city of Cusco and in other parts of Peruvian Andes, adobe masonry is the primary construction material. Adobe continues to be used for the construction of housing because of its low cost, its thermal properties, the use of unskilled labor, and the local traditions of the Peruvian highlands. The Peruvian National Statistics Office estimates that 67% of rural housing in Cusco is made of adobe masonry. Besides, previous seismic events and laboratory tests demonstrated that adobe dwellings without reinforcement are prone to collapse during an earthquake. Therefore, seismic vulnerability assessment of this type of dwellings is necessary aiming at developing proper contingency and mitigation risk policies. Then, fragility curves constitute a key tool when conducting seismic loss assessment because they provide information regarding the probability of exceeding a certain damage limit state as a function of a given engineering demand parameter. This work aims at developing fragility curves, combining in-plane and outof- plane loading conditions, for typical adobe buildings located in the city of Cusco. Initially, a set of one- and two-story adobe houses were studied to determine the geometrical characteristics of representative local building typologies. Subsequently, 1,000 artificial buildings were generated by means of Monte Carlo simulation based on the information gathered. The structural capacity of each artificial building was represented by simplified bilinear and trilinear capacity curves for in-plane and out-of plane mechanisms, respectively. In order to represent the characteristics associated with sub duction processes, a set of ground motion records was established. The damage state of each building was assessed for each seismic record, and this information was collected into a Probability Damage Matrix (DPM). Finally, fragility curves were fitted for each damage state of the cumulative DPM. Preliminary results show that one- and two story adobe dwellings have a probability of collapse of 30 and 60%, respectively, when considering a peak ground acceleration of 0.30 g, which corresponds to the expected acceleration related to a return period of 475 years over a soil type 2 according to the Peruvian Standards. © 2020 Sumerente, Lovon, Tarque and Chácara.",Assessment of combined in-plane and out-of-plane fragility functions for adobe masonry buildings in the peruvian andes,2020,Adobe; Capacity curves; In-plane failure; Out-of-plane failure; Seismic vulnerability,None,0,1
12628,"The evaluation of earthquake damage considering past events can be a useful tool to verify or calibrate damage and risk models, as well as to assess the possible consequences that future events may cause in a region. This study describes a process to estimate earthquake damage considering past events, and using the OpenQuake-engine, the open-source software for seismic hazard and risk analysis of the Global Earthquake Model Foundation. Exposure and fragility models from the recently completed South America Risk Assessment (SARA) project were combined with conditioned ground motion fields from past events to calculate structural damage in the affected region. These results can facilitate the creation of risk reduction measures, such as retrofitting campaigns, development of insurance mechanisms and enhancement of building codes.

12630,"Most of existing steel multi-storey frames in Europe have been designed before the introduction of modern seismic design provisions, hence they often exhibit low performance under earthquake loads due to their low lateral resistance and energy dissipation capacity. In addition, such structures often include rigid and brittle masonry infill walls that highly influence their lateral response and distribution of damage pattern. However, current procedures for the assessment of existing steel buildings in Europe, included in the Eurocode 8 - Part 3 (EC8-3), do not provide adequate guidance for the assessment of 'weak' steel frame with masonry infill walls. Moreover, most of available modelling approaches of masonry infills formerly developed for reinforced concrete (RC) structures do not properly represent the behaviour of infill walls in steel frames. An improved numerical has to be provided to satisfactorily mimic infill walls' behaviour in steel moment frames. To this end, an experi-mental and theoretical study was carried out within the framework of HITFRAMES (i.e., HybrId Testing of an Existing Steel Frame with Infills under Multiple EarthquakeS) SERA project. This paper firstly presents the limitations of current EC8-3 by conducting a code-based assessment on a case study steel moment frame using pushover analysis. Three different single strut models, widely used for simulating the presence of masonry infills in RC structures, are considered for the numerical analyses. The paper also presents the results of pseudo-dynamic (PsD) tests performed on a large-scale 3D steel frame with masonry infills. The capability of the different masonry infill models is successively evaluated by comparisons between numerical and experimental results. On the basis of the obtained results, recommendations on how to potentially improve the single strut model for masonry infills surrounded by steel frames are also provided.","Assessment of existing steel frames: Numerical study, pseudo-dynamic testing and influence of masonry infills",2021,Existing steel frames; Seismic performance; Pseudo-dynamic testing; Masonry infills; Single-strut model,DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; PERFORMANCE; BUILDINGS; MODEL,0,1
12632,"In this study the main results of a detailed analysis of an actual building, which was severely damaged during the Mw 5.1, May 11th 2011, Lorca earthquake (Murcia, Spain) are presented. The dynamic behavior of the building was analyzed by means of empirical and numerical approaches. The displacement response of the building submitted to ambient noise was recorded by using a Real Aperture Radar (RAR). This approach provides a secure remote sensing procedure that does not require entering the building. Based on the blueprints and other available graphical information about the building, a numeric 3D model was also set up, allowing obtaining capacity spectra and fragility curves in the two main resistant directions of the building. The main purpose of this study was to check out the feasibility of the RAR-based method to detect the safety state of a damaged building after an earthquake, without the need of entering unsafe structures. A good consistency of the numerical and experimental approaches and the observed damage was obtained, showing that RAR interferometric-based tools may provide promising supplementary remote sensing methods to safely survey and report about the structural health and the operative conditions of buildings in post-earthquake scenarios.",Assessment of Post-Earthquake Damaged Building with Interferometric Real Aperture Radar,2019,seismic damage; seismic fragility; remote sensing; real aperture radar; capacity spectrum; Lorca earthquake,REINFORCED-CONCRETE BUILDINGS; MODAL IDENTIFICATION; RC BUILDINGS; HEALTH STATE; CAPACITY; STORY; VULNERABILITY; HERITAGE; SENSOR,0,1
12633,"A large number of low to moderate earthquake incidents have been witnessed in the northern and western parts of Thailand. These incidents usually lead to various damage levels in various structures. Therefore, a sufficient lateral force resisting structures should be designed for the construction in such earthquake-prone areas. This paper presents the relevance of using a typical composite wide U beam-column system for mitigation of structural failure and collapse from the seismic hazard in Thailand. The investigated composite structural system consists of precast U beams, precast columns, and cast-in-situ concrete over the precast U beams and in the joint regions. The system also includes post-tensioning in the cast-in-situ area of the composite beams. The system has widely been used in low-to mid-rise commercial building in Thailand. In order to scrutinize the seismic performance of the system, a half-scale specimen of the post-tensioned precast U beam-column joint was tested under an incremental displacement-controlled lateral cyclic load. The laboratory test revealed the drift capacity, damage pattern, strain development in the rebars etc. of the precast wide U beam-column interior joint. Based on the obtained drift capacity, displacement-based assessment of the system was carried out. In addition, the observed damages on the tested structure were evaluated using damage grading criteria for building subjected to earthquake. The assessment showed a high potential of the post-tensioned precast wide U beam-column system to mitigate the structural failure and collapse from the earthquake hazard. However, some improvements in the current seismic performance of the system are required to employ the system in high seismic zones. © 2021 ASEAN University Network/Southeast Asia Engineering Education Development Network.

12634,"Sustainable development studies have recently begun to consider damage loss attributable to natural hazards. A sustainable perspective on building design entails an understanding of a structure's life-cycle environmental costs and consideration of the associated environmental impacts induced by natural hazards. Damage repair costs lead to additional material and energy consumption, creating harmful environmental impacts. Merging the results obtained from a natural hazard evaluation and related environmental impacts for buildings in seismically prone areas provides a novel outlook for sustainable design decisions. To evaluate the environmental impacts caused by buildings, the long-term effects accrued throughout a building's lifetime and the effects associated with damage repair need to be quantified. A literature review and a proposed method for this type of analysis have been developed and are discussed. Using Athena and HAZUS-MH software, this study evaluated the performance of steel and concrete buildings by considering their life-cycle assessments and earthquake resistance. This study determined that code design level greatly affects building repair and damage estimations. This study presented two case-study buildings and found specific results using several assumptions. Future research recommendations were provided to make this methodology more useful in real-world applications.

12635,"Issues regarding reinforced concrete (RC) high-rise buildings involve different seismic scenarios, such as near- and far-field earthquakes, which can result in different levels and complex seismic scenario structures related to global damage. This study aims to evaluate the seismic scenario structures of a 23-storey RC high-rise building based on different damage measures and to develop a fragility curve with different limit state criteria. Six ground motions are selected to represent two seismic scenarios. Seismic scenario-based global response of the building at increasing earthquake intensity measures is adopted using incremental dynamic analysis (IDA). IDA curves and interstorey drift are used in the parametric study. The structural performance and damage measure of RC high-rise buildings are evaluated with performance-based seismic design limit state. The four performance levels proposed by ATC-43 are operational performance, immediate occupancy, life safety and collapse prevention. The IDA curves showed that near-field effect has a high frequency that gives impact at early intensity measures on building collapse compared with far-field effect. Meanwhile, interstorey drift result indicates that the near-field effect has a larger effect on building damages compared with the far-field effect. Based on the fragility curves, near-field earthquakes have a larger effect towards structural damages than far-field earthquakes. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Assessment of Seismic Scenario-Structure Based Limit State Criteria for a Reinforced Concrete High-Rise Building,2020,None,None,0,1

12638,"We propose a new convolutional neural networks method in combination with ordinal regression aiming at assessing the degree of building damage caused by earthquakes with aerial imagery. The ordinal regression model and a deep learning algorithm are incorporated to make full use of the information to improve the accuracy of the assessment. A new loss function was introduced in this paper to combine convolutional neural networks and ordinal regression. Assessing the level of damage to buildings can be considered as equivalent to predicting the ordered labels of buildings to be assessed. In the existing research, the problem has usually been simplified as a problem of pure classification to be further studied and discussed, which ignores the ordinal relationship between different levels of damage, resulting in a waste of information. Data accumulated throughout history are used to build network models for assessing the level of damage, and models for assessing levels of damage to buildings based on deep learning are described in detail, including model construction, implementation methods, and the selection of hyperparameters, and verification is conducted by experiments. When categorizing the damage to buildings into four types, we apply the method proposed in this paper to aerial images acquired from the 2014 Ludian earthquake and achieve an overall accuracy of 77.39%; when categorizing damage to buildings into two types, the overall accuracy of the model is 93.95%, exceeding such values in similar types of theories and methods.",Assessment of the Degree of Building Damage Caused by Disaster Using Convolutional Neural Networks in Combination with Ordinal Regression,2019,earthquake; rapid mapping; damage assessment; deep learning; convolutional neural networks; ordinal regression; aerial image,LUDIAN EARTHQUAKE; 2003 BAM; IMAGERY; IRAN,0,1
12639,"Damage scenarios caused by the 2016 Central Italy earthquake confirmed the relevant role of interventions on masonry buildings' seismic performance, also by increasing (rather than reducing) their vulnerability. Notwithstanding, current literature procedures aimed at assigning to buildings an European Macroseismic Scale 1998 (EMS-98) vulnerability class (A to F) do not consider such influence especially referring to the several intervention techniques applied to masonry buildings since the 1980s in Italy. This impaired a proper matching of vulnerability classes to the real performances, as strengthened buildings are conventionally assigned to average vulnerability conditions (class C). In the present work, vulnerability classes are appropriately assigned to buildings in strengthened conditions, basing on the analysis of 2264 dwellings placed in 19 settlements. Inspections were carried out with a purposely developed rapid visual screening procedure. A performance-based definition of structural types considered a building's masonry quality, diaphragms' stiffness, and kind of interventions graded between downgrading and upgrading. Types with the same behaviour were grouped into vulnerability classes, in the full range from A to D, through a literature model compatible with the EMS-98. Rubble stone buildings with downgrading or worsening interventions behaved like those in original conditions (class A), whereas improved buildings typically performed like class C. Upgrading interventions led to class D, similarly to modern clay block buildings. Masonry quality influenced the classification more than diaphragms' stiffness. The empirical membership of each type to vulnerability classes was obtained, that which allowed to include variously strengthened masonry buildings within the EMS-98 framework.",Assigning the macroseismic vulnerability classes to strengthened ordinary masonry buildings: An update from extensive data of the 2016 Central Italy earthquake,2021,2016 Central Italy earthquake; Masonry buildings; Strengthening interventions; EMS-98; Vulnerability classification,SEISMIC RISK; DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; SEQUENCE; SCALE; TOWN,0,1

In this study, an automated building seismic damage assessment method using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) is introduced.

12641,"There are more than 1,000 tornadoes in the United States each year, yet engineers do not typically design for tornadoes because of insufficient information about wind loads.

This study presents and tests an automated geographic information system (GIS) method using postevent point cloud data collected by terrestrial scanners and preevent aerial images to calculate the percentage of roof and wall damage and estimate wind speeds at an individual building scale. Simulations determined that for typical point cloud density (>25∈∈points/m2), a GIS raster cell size of 40-50 cm resulted in less than 10% error in damaged roof and wall detection.

12643,"Automated remote sensing methods have not gained widespread usage for damage assessment after hurricane events, especially for low-rise buildings, such as individual houses and small businesses. Hurricane wind, storm surge with waves, and inland flooding have unique damage signatures, further complicating the development of robust automated assessment methodologies. As a step toward realizing automated damage assessment for multi-hazard hurricane events, this paper presents a mono-temporal image classification methodology that quickly and accurately differentiates urban debris from non-debris areas using post-event images. Three classification approaches are presented: spectral, textural, and combined spectral–textural. The methodology is demonstrated for Gulfport, Mississippi, using IKONOS panchromatic satellite and NOAA aerial colour imagery collected after 2005 Hurricane Katrina. The results show that multivariate texture information significantly improves debris class detection performance by decreasing the confusion between debris and other land cover types, and the extracted debris zone accurately captures debris distribution. Additionally, the extracted debris boundary is approximately equivalent regardless of imagery type, demonstrating the flexibility and robustness of the debris mapping methodology. While the test case presents results for hurricane hazards, the proposed methodology is generally developed and expected to be effective in delineating debris zones for other natural hazards, including tsunamis, tornadoes, and earthquakes. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",Automatic urban debris zone extraction from post-hurricane very high-resolution satellite and aerial imagery,2016,None,Aerial photography; Alarm systems; Automation; Damage detection; Debris; Floods; Hazards; Hurricanes; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Automated assessment; Classification approach; Detection performance; Low-rise buildings; Mapping methodology; Multivariate texture; Panchromatic satellites; Very high resolution; Image classification,0,1

Therefore, the need to understand how ceiling systems perform during an earthquake is becoming increasingly important. However, few studies have been conducted on suspension ceiling systems to identify where they are vulnerable. A series of suspension-ceiling component experiments were designed at the University of Nevada, Reno, using interlocking grid members, including 2-ft. and 4-ft. cross tees. The test specimens were first subjected to monotonic and cyclic loading to obtain their failure capacities. Then several axial capacity fragility curves (not the seismic fragility curves of ceiling systems) were developed based on axial displacement capacities as well as strength capacities of interlocking ceiling joints in the absence of ceiling panels. Besides the experimental studies, a series of analytical models for ceiling joints were developed and validated using component experimental data. © 2016, Earthquake Engineering Research Institute.",Axial capacity evaluation for typical suspended ceiling joints,2016,None,Earthquakes; Axial displacements; Fragility curves; Monotonic and cyclic loading; Non-structural elements; Seismic fragility curves; Strength capacity; Suspended ceilings; University of Nevada; Ceilings; bearing capacity; displacement; experimental study; failure analysis; seismic response; seismicity; uniaxial test; Nevada; United States,0,1

12647,"The high level of damage suffered by historical structures due to the interaction between materials’ aging and seismic events that occurred during the last decade has revealed the need for developing reliable and long-lasting prevention techniques. In this context, long-term structural health monitoring (SHM) is a practice that has been spreading in recent years. A monitoring system is composed by an optimized network of sensors placed in strategic positions within the building. The data recorded by the sensors enable to track the structural behavior over time. In this study an automated Bayesian-based procedure, i.e., an inverse problem able to detect in real-time the occurrence of damage, is proposed. In particular, hourly data are periodically divided into subgroups and used for the automatic Bayesian update. The methodology can be summarized as follows: (i) preliminary calibration of a Finite Element (FE) model able to reproduce the structural dynamic behavior identified by the experimental vibration data; (ii) identification of damage-sensitive portions of the structure by performing non-linear static analyses (NLSA) on the FE model; (iii) calibration of a digital twin of the structure by surrogate modeling and definition of the sensitivity damage chart; (iv) real time Bayesian model updating of the selected uncertain parameters in order to continuously identify possible changes in the structural behavior that can be associated with a certain level of damage. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Bayesian-Based Damage Assessment of Historical Structures Using Vibration Monitoring Data,2021,Architectural heritage; Bayesian approach; Damage detection; Structural Health Monitoring,Bayesian networks; Calibration; Damage detection; Digital twin; Inverse problems; Monitoring; Structural dynamics; Uncertainty analysis; Vibration analysis; Bayesian model updating; Historical structures; Non-linear static analysis; Prevention techniques; Structural behaviors; Structural health monitoring (SHM); Uncertain parameters; Vibration monitoring; Structural health monitoring,0,1

12650,"European Union's energy roadmap up to year 2050 states that in order to have an efficient and sustainable economy, with minimum or decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, along with use of renewable resources, each constituent state has the option for nuclear energy production as one desirable option. Every scenario considered for tackling climate change issues, along with security of supply positions the nuclear energy as a recommended option, an option that is highly competitive with respect to others. Nuclear energy, along with other renewable power sources are considered to be the main pillars in the energy sector for greenhouse gas emission mitigation at European level. European Union considers that nuclear energy must be treated as a highly recommended option since it can contribute to security of energy supply. Romania showed excellent track-records in operating in a safe and economically sound manner of Cernavoda NPP Units 1&2. Both Units are in top 10 worldwide in terms of capacity factor. Due to Romania's need to ensure the security of electricity supply, to meet the environmental targets and to move to low carbon generation technologies, Cernavoda Units 3&4 Project appears as a must. This Project was started in 2010 and it is expected to have the Units running by 2025. Cost effective and safety operation of a Nuclear Power Plant is made taking into consideration functional limits of its equipment. As common practice, every nuclear reactor type (technology used) is tested according to the worse credible accident or equipment failure that can occur. For CANDU type reactor, this is a Loss of Cooling Accident (LOCA). In a LOCA type accident in a CANDU NPP, using RELAP/SCDAP code for fuel bundle damage assessment the radioactive nuclei are to be quantified. Recently, CANDU type NPP accidents are studied using the RELAP/SCDAP code only. The code formerly developed for PWR type reactors was adapted for the CANDU geometry and can assess the accident progression consequences up to a certain point. The code assesses the fuel bundle damage progression, but cannot assess further core damage for a CANDU type core, and starting from these data the amount of damaged fuel can be calculated. The radio nuclei present in the damaged fuel are supposed to be released into the main heat transport system and after that into the containment building in the worst case scenario. Assessing the radioactive nuclei maximum release is the purpose of the present paper. The radioactive nuclei release is needed for the accident management plan, limiting the environmental and population impact of the supposed accident, and furthermore for a later site remediation plan that can be put in action after the complete mitigation of the accident consequences. The maximum quantity of radio nuclei released during the accident calculated in this paper is a worst case scenario evaluation that can lead to better preparedness in an accident scenario.",Beyond designed functional margins in CANDU type NPP.

12653,"To predict the hazard-induced risks of buildings and infrastructures and assess the losses caused by hazards, the fragility curve method is a common quantitative risk assessment procedure for civil structures. It has been popularly used for decades for different hazards including earthquakes, hazardous winds, tsunamis, and fires. However, there are limited reports regarding blast risk assessment of buildings using the fragility curve method. This study developed empirical blast fragility curves for wood residential buildings using the real 2013 West fertilizer plant explosion data. The development processes included five key steps: (1) selecting and calculating the blast hazard intensity measure and the air-blast incident overpressure; (2) selecting the damage states rating systems and classifying the damage state of each damaged building; (3) determining the frequency distribution of damaged buildings for each damage state; (4) proving the cumulative lognormal distribution function to describe the fragility relationship between the blast damage states and the blast hazard intensity measure; and (5) constructing the empirical fragility curves by fitting the building damage information to the selected fragility relationship distribution function. The resulted blast fragility curves of this study can be used by government officials to predict blast-induced damages of residential buildings, to plan the optimal locations and operational capacities of emergency facilities, to estimate total economic losses due to potential explosions, and to plan the social, physical and economic resilience of communities. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Blast Risk Assessment of Wood Residential Buildings: West Fertilizer Plant Explosion Case,2020,None,Classification (of information); Curve fitting; Distribution functions; Fertilizers; Hazards; Housing; Losses; Blast-induced damages; Development process; Frequency distributions; Government officials; Log-normal distribution; Operational capacity; Quantitative risk assessment; Residential building; Risk assessment,0,1
12655,"The development of earthquake early warning systems over the last decade has seen a number of studies that have focused either on improving the real-time estimation of seismological parameters, or on the rapid characterization of the possible damage suffered by a structure. However, the rapid increase in real-time seismic networks with stations installed in both the free field and inside buildings now offers the opportunity to combine the experience gained from these activities to develop a comprehensive real-time damage assessment scheme that, depending upon the time frame and spatial scale of interest, can provide useful information for a risk-based early warning system or for rapid loss assessment. Furthermore, newly developed instruments, with their enhanced computing capabilities, also offer the chance to combine early-warning procedures with the monitoring (during seismic crises) of a structure’s behavior.

This paper presents a semi-automated feature-based approach to the identification of building conditions especially in affected areas using geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing information. For image analysis, a new detected part of contour (DPC) feature is developed for the assessment of building integrity. The DPC calculates a part of the building contour that can be detected in the remotely sensed image. Additional texture features provide information about the area inside the buildings. The effectiveness of the proposed method is proved by high overall classification accuracy for two different study cases. The results demonstrate that the map-to-image strategy enables extracting valuable information from the remotely sensed image for each individual vector object, thereby being a better choice for change detection within urban areas.",Building Change Detection Using High Resolution Remotely Sensed Data and GIS,2016,Change detection; data mining; generation of features; geographic information systems (GIS); GIS geographic resources analysis support system (GRASS); open source software; remote sensing,2010 HAITI EARTHQUAKE; DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; CLASSIFICATION; SATELLITE; IMAGE,0,1

The manual assessment method requires experts in structural engineering who have enough knowledge and experience in building damage assessment. To facilitate and overcome these problems, a crack classification system is developed by using a digital image processing approach (pattern recognition) that can classify cracks into the mild, moderate, or severe categories using GLCM features and SVM classifier. Based on the experimental results that the proposed method has appropriately worked for classification of two crack classes (mild and severe) indicated by 94.44% of accuracy, 88.89% of precision, and 100.00% of recall. While for three crack classes (mild, moderate, and severe) obtained the accuracy 81,48%, recall 81,41% and precision 88,09%.

12660,"After a destructive earthquake, most of the casualties are brought about by building collapse. Our work is focused on using a single postevent PolSAR (full-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar) imagery to extract the building damage information for effective emergency decision-making. PolSAR data is subject to sunlight and contains richer backscatter information. The undamaged buildings whose orientation is not parallel to the SAR flight pass and the collapsed buildings share similar dominated scattering mechanisms, i.e., volume scattering, so they are easily confused. However, the two kinds of buildings have different textures. For a more accurate classification of damaged buildings and undamaged buildings, the OPCE (optimization of polarimetric contrast enhancement) algorithm is employed to enhance the contrast ratio of the textures for the two kinds of buildings and the precision-weighted multifeature fusion (PWMF) method is proposed to merge the multiple texture features. The experiment results show that the accuracy of the proposed novel method is improved by 8.34% compared to the traditional method. In general, the proposed PWMF method can effectively merge the multiple features and the overestimation of the building collapse rate can be reduced using the proposed method in this study.",Building Damage Assessment Based on the Fusion of Multiple Texture Features Using a Single Post-Earthquake PolSAR Image,2019,Earthquake; buildings; damage assessment; texture features; feature fusion; PolSAR; collapsed buildings,SCATTERING MODEL; MARCH 11; SAR; EARTHQUAKE; DISASTER,0,1
12662,"Damage assessment from very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery plays a fundamental role in the delineation of the impact caused by catastrophic events. To date internationally accepted standard guidelines on how to assess damages to building using vertical imagery have not yet been developed. This study therefore proposes a building damage scale–and related interpretation guidelines to be operationally adopted as a standard by the main stakeholders–tailored to analyses based on VHR remote sensed vertical imagery. Preliminarily, some of the damage scales used for building damage assessment by the main satellite-based emergency mapping services have been analysed and discussed. A quantitative thematic accuracy analysis based on the open accessible crisis datasets related to the earthquake occurred in Central Italy in August 2016 has been carried out. The results highlight that by using VHR remotely sensed images it is not possible to directly apply damage classification scales addressing slight structural damages (e.g. the lowest grades proposed by EMS-’98). The paper demonstrates that using different damage classes and detailing the interpretation guidelines with operational examples is essential to increase the thematic accuracy of the analysis. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

12663,"Damage to individual buildings in an urban area of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, from the 2010 Haiti earthquake was assessed by means of high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity images and ancillary building footprints. A comparison of pre- and post-event images and a building damage inventory showed that backscattering intensity between images was more significantly changed in collapsed buildings than in less damaged buildings. The linear discriminant function, based on the difference and correlation coefficient of the images was developed to detect collapsed buildings. The result showed that almost 75% of the buildings were correctly detected by discriminant analysis. An accuracy assessment revealed the difficulty of detecting small and congested buildings because the number of image pixels was too small and the buildings were obscured by neighboring buildings and other features in the images. © 2016, Earthquake Engineering Research Institute.",Building damage assessment using high-resolution satellite SAR images of the 2010 Haiti earthquake,2016,None,Damage detection; Discriminant analysis; Earthquakes; Radar imaging; Synthetic aperture radar; Accuracy assessment; Backscattering intensity; Collapsed buildings; Correlation coefficient; High resolution satellites; High resolution synthetic aperture radar; Linear discriminant functions; Neighboring building; Buildings; accuracy assessment; building; comparative study; correlation; damage mechanics; discriminant analysis; Haiti earthquake 2010; image analysis; image resolution; synthetic aperture radar; Haiti; Hispaniola; Port au Prince,0,1
12664,"When carrying out change detection for building damage assessment using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity images, it is desirable that the observation conditions of the images are similar and acquisition time is close to the earthquake occurrence time. In this way, the influence of the radar operating system and ground temporal changes can be minimized, facilitating high-accuracy assessment results. However, in practice, especially in poor developing areas, it is difficult to obtain ideal images owing to limited pre-event data archives. In the 2015 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake, the TerraSAR-X satellite captured the influenced Sankhu area before and after the earthquake on May 30, 2010 and May 13, 2015, respectively. The pre-event data was obtained in an ascending path with an incidence angle of 41◦, whereas the post-event data was obtained in a descending path with an incidence angle of 33◦. To apply the obtained data that had different observation conditions and longtime intervals for building damage assessment, two ways were considered and studied. On one hand, the feasibility of change detection considering these factors was investigated. Pixel statistic characteristics were analyzed in twelve test areas to check the influence of temporal changes, and building footprints were buffered considering two different incidence angles. On the other hand, the reliability of classification based on only post-event data was studied. The results showed good classification performance of some texture parameters, such as the “range value” and “standard de-viation,” which are worthy of further study. Moreover, the classification results obtained using the post-event data achieved similar accuracy to that using both the pre-and post-event data, preliminarily indicating the research value of post-event data-based building damage detection as it can solve the pre-event data limitation problem once and for all. © 2019, Fuji Technology Press.

12665,"On 24 August 2016, the M 6.2 Amatrice earthquake struck central Italy, well-known as a seismically active region, causing considerable damage to buildings in the town of Amatrice and the surrounding area. Damage from this earthquake was assessed quantitatively by means of multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) coherence and SAR intensity methods using dual-polarized SAR data obtained from the Sentinel-1 (VV, VH) and ALOS-2 (HH, HV) satellites. We developed linear discriminant functions based on three items: (1) the differential coherence values; (2) the differential backscattering intensity values of pre- and post-event images; and (3) a binary damage map of the optical pre- and post-event imagery. The accuracy of the proposed model was 84% for the Sentinel-1 data and 76% for the ALOS-2 data. The damage proxy maps deduced from the linear discriminant functions can be useful in the parcel-by-parcel assessment of building damage and development of spatial models for the allocation of urban search and rescue operations. © 2017 by the authors.","Building damage assessment using multisensor dual-polarized synthetic aperture radar data for the 2016 M 6.2 Amatrice earthquake, Italy",2017,Amatrice earthquake; Building damage; Dual-polarization; Multitemporal analysis; Synthetic aperture radar,Damage detection; Earthquakes; Geophysics; Radar; Radar imaging; Backscattering intensity; Building damage; Dual-polarizations; Intensity methods; Linear discriminant functions; Multi-temporal analysis; Seismically active region; Urban search and rescue operations; Synthetic aperture radar,0,1
12667,"Using aerial cameras, satellite remote sensing or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) equipped with cameras can facilitate search and rescue tasks after disasters. The traditional manual interpretation of huge aerial images is inefficient and could be replaced by machine learning-based methods combined with image processing techniques. Given the development of machine learning, researchers find that convolutional neural networks can effectively extract features from images. Some target detection methods based on deep learning, such as the single-shot multibox detector (SSD) algorithm, can achieve better results than traditional methods. However, the impressive performance of machine learning-based methods results from the numerous labeled samples. Given the complexity of post-disaster scenarios, obtaining many samples in the aftermath of disasters is difficult. To address this issue, a damaged building assessment method using SSD with pretraining and data augmentation is proposed in the current study and highlights the following aspects. (1) Objects can be detected and classified into undamaged buildings, damaged buildings, and ruins. (2) A convolution auto-encoder (CAE) that consists of VGG16 is constructed and trained using unlabeled post-disaster images. As a transfer learning strategy, the weights of the SSD model are initialized using the weights of the CAE counterpart. (3) Data augmentation strategies, such as image mirroring, rotation, Gaussian blur, and Gaussian noise processing, are utilized to augment the training data set. As a case study, aerial images of Hurricane Sandy in 2012 were maximized to validate the proposed method's effectiveness. Experiments show that the pretraining strategy can improve of 10% in terms of overall accuracy compared with the SSD trained from scratch. These experiments also demonstrate that using data augmentation strategies can improve mAP and mF1 by 72% and 20%, respectively. Finally, the experiment is further verified by another dataset of Hurricane Irma, and it is concluded that the paper method is feasible. © 2019 by the authors.",Building damage detection from post-event aerial imagery using single shot multibox detector,2019,Building damage assessment; Convolutional autoencoder; Deep learning; Post-event; SSD,None,0,1

12670,"Building damage assessment is of great significance to disaster monitoring. Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can record the polarization scattering measurement matrix of ground objects and obtain more abundant ground object information, meaning that they can be used for assessing damage to buildings. In this paper, a new approach is proposed to assess building damage using the Touzi incoherent decomposition and SAR-based characteristics of buildings before and after damage. The March 11th, 2011 earthquake that struck the coast of northeast Japan serves as the demonstration of the technique using quad-polarimetric ALOS PALSAR data acquired before and after the disaster. The analysis shows that after the buildings are damaged, there is a clear decrease in the alpha(s1) (the dominant scattering-type magnitude) components and the degree of this reduction corresponds to the degree of building damage. This means that the alpha(s1) components obtained by Touzi decomposition can effectively reflect the degree of building damage. On this basis, a model based on Touzi decomposition was established to evaluate the degree of damage to buildings, and the accuracy of the model was validated using high-resolution optical data acquired before and after the earthquake. The experimental results show that Touzi decomposition can be effectively used for damage assessment mapping in built-up areas.",Building damage mapping based on Touzi decomposition using quad-polarimetric ALOS PALSAR data,2020,Touzi decomposition; quad-polarization; SAR; buildings; damage; disaster management,SAR IMAGES; EXTRACTION,0,1
12671,"After an earthquake, rapidly and accurately obtaining building damage information can help to effectively guide the implementation of the emergency rescue and can reduce disaster losses and casualties. Using a single post-earthquake fully-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image to interpret building damage information not only involves a guaranteed data source but is also easy and can be rapidly implemented. This paper is focused on rapid building earthquake damage detection in urban areas using post-earthquake PolSAR data. In PolSAR images, the undamaged buildings parallel to satellite flight pass are different from the collapsed buildings, but the undamaged buildings divergent to satellite flight pass are very similar to collapsed buildings because of their volume scattering characteristics. In this paper, the method of polarization orientation angle (POA) compensation is employed to increase the scattering power of buildings divergent to satellite flight pass, and then Wishart supervised classification is implemented on the PolSAR data after POA compensation. In addition, the two parameters of normalized difference of the dihedral component (NDDC) and rho(HHHV) are proposed to improve the classification accuracy of the Wishart supervised classification, and both the undamaged buildings and collapsed buildings are determined. The study was carried out after the 4.14 Yushu earthquake in Yushu County, Qinghai province, China.

12676,"In this work, the directionality effects during the M-W 7.8 earthquake, which occurred in Muisne (Ecuador) on 16 April 2016, were analyzed under two perspectives. The first one deals with the influence of these effects on seismic intensity measures (IMs), while the second refers to the assessment of the expected damage of a specific building located in Manta city, Ecuador, as a function of its azimuthal orientation. The records of strong motion in 21 accelerometric stations were used to analyze directionality in seismic actions. At the closest station to the epicenter (R-Rup = 20 km), the peak ground acceleration was 1380 cm/s(2) (EW component of the APED station). A detailed study of the response spectra ratifies the importance of directionality and confirms the need to consider these effects in seismic hazard studies. Differences between IMs values that consider the directionality and those obtained from the as-recorded accelerograms are significant and they agree with studies carried out in other regions. Concerning the variation of the expected damage with respect to the building orientation, a reinforced concrete building, which was seriously affected by the earthquake, was taken as a case study. For this analysis, the accelerograms recorded at a nearby station and detailed structural documentation were used. The ETABS software was used for the structural analysis. Modal and pushover analyses were performed, obtaining capacity curves and capacity spectra in the two main axes of the building. Two advanced methods for damage assessment were used to obtain fragility and mean damage state curves. The performance points were obtained through the linear equivalent approximation. This allows estimation and analysis of the expected mean damage state and the probability of complete damage as functions of the building orientation. Results show that the actual probability of complete damage is close to 60%. This fact is mainly due to the greater severity of the seismic action in one of the two main axes of the building. The results are in accordance with the damage produced by the earthquake in the building and confirm the need to consider the directionality effects in damage and seismic risk assessments.",Case Study of a Heavily Damaged Building during the 2016 M-W 7.8 Ecuador Earthquake: Directionality Effects in Seismic Actions and Damage Assessment,2021,damage assessment; directionality effects; intensity measures; parametric model; 2016 Ecuador earthquake,None,0,1

The numerical results indicate that the linear AEM models are as reliable as the finite element method (FEM) models to predict the modal response of the case study temple. In addition, the AEM models can potentially be further developed to estimate the damage from future earthquakes through nonlinear analyses. The present study not only informs the present health status of the masonry temple, but it also estimates how acceleration at the base of the temple is propagated through the height of the temple through comparison of floor response spectra, which could provide valuable insights into the force distribution over the height of the temple for the design of future retrofits.",Case study: Post-earthquake model updating of a heritage pagoda masonry temple using AEM and FEM,2020,Applied Element Method (AEM); Finite Element Method (FEM); Lidar; Nepal Gorkha Earthquake; Pagoda temples; Post-earthquake damage assessment,APPLIED ELEMENT METHOD; 2015 GORKHA; DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; DYNAMIC IDENTIFICATION; KATHMANDU VALLEY; SEISMIC ANALYSIS; NEPAL; BUILDINGS; EARTHQUAKE; PERFORMANCE,0,1

12683,"Steel Plate Shear Walls (SPSWs) have proven to be efficient passive energy dissipating systems. Unstiffened SPSWs dissipate energy through tension yielding of web plates and formation of plastic hinges at the ends of horizontal boundary elements. In case of mid- and high-rise buildings, the traditional configuration of SPSW leads to column dimensions larger than the standard sections available commercially. A staggered arrangement of web plates reduces the axial demand in the columns of a staggered-SPSW, which reduces the column sizes. In comparison to a traditional SPSW, staggered-SPSW show reduced interstory drift and a more uniform drift distribution along the height, when subjected to a design based earthquake event. Also, staggered-SPSWs are less prone to a soft- or weak-story mechanism, resulting in better seismic performance. This study performs static and dynamic analyses to evaluate the performance of staggered SPSW during strong earthquake events. 6- and 9-story SPSWs with staggered and conventional configurations are developed in OpenSees. Plate-tearing and flexural hinge strength deterioration are incorporated through strain softening of the material. The modelling technique is validated against published experimental test results. 22-pairs of ground motions, recommended by FEMA P695, are scaled to perform incremental dynamic analysis. The interstory drift response, at design-based-earthquake level, and the fragility curve show that staggered SPSW perform better than their conventional counterpart. For the 6-story conventional SPSW, early failure is observed at the top story, which is not the case when staggered arrangement is adopted. The response of 9-story staggered SPSW is marginally better than the conventional SPSW. © 11th National Conference on Earthquake Engineering 2018.

For this respect, an example four-story self-centering precast wall building was designed and simulated using the numerical model verified according to reported test data. A total of eight different designs are considered for the example building with varying parameters of PT and ED designs, and R values. The analytical models are then subjected to a suite of 44 ground motions with each scaled up until the collapse occurs. The fragility curves are generated using the incremental dynamic analysis data, and the results are then used for collapse risk assessment in accordance with FEMA P695 procedure. The evaluation results show that ED designs have more influence than PT designs to the overall collapse fragility of self-centering precast walls. Nevertheless, all the prototype walls in this study are proved to have acceptably low probabilities of collapse, which is required by the design code.",Collapse fragility analysis of self-centering precast concrete walls with different post-tensioning and energy dissipation designs,2019,Self-centering precast wall; Seismic fragility; Incremental dynamic analysis; Collapse risk,SEISMIC PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR,0,1
12685,"Seismic risk assessment is a critical first step toward mitigating the social and economic losses resulting from earthquakes. The FEMA P-58 document, prepared by the Applied Technology Council (ATC), provides a methodology for seismic performance assessment of buildings. The methodology consists of five main steps: assembling the building performance model, defining earthquake hazards, analyzing building response, developing collapse fragility, and quantifying performance. Owing to the probabilistic nature of the methodology framework, each step incorporates uncertainty. After the 2011 earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand, a significant number of reinforced masonry low-rise buildings were deemed unusable, although the damage was repairable. This created a need to investigate the seismic collapse performance of a reinforced masonry shear wall (RMSW) system. In this study, the FEMA P-58 methodology is implemented to assess the performance of a typical RMSW office building designed according to the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) 2010 and the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) S304-14 masonry design code provisions. In order to develop the building collapse fragility curves, an analytical model to predict the behavior of RMSW was developed. The model was calibrated using experimental results from an earlier study by the authors on scaled RMSW. Subsequently, an incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) procedure was performed to study the RMSW performance under a suite of ground motions consistent with the NBCC 2010 design spectrum for a high seismicity site in Victoria, British Columbia. The results of the IDA were used to develop collapse fragility curves for RMSW in order to facilitate the quantification of the collapse risk under different levels of seismic demand. This study is expected to catalyze the development of design provisions and subsequent adoption of RMSW in the next generations of seismic codes in North America. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Collapse Fragility Evaluation of Ductile Reinforced Concrete Block Wall Systems for Seismic Risk Assessment,2016,Collapse; FEMA P-58; FEMA P-695; Fragility curves; Incremental dynamic analysis; Reinforced masonry; Seismic performance; Structural walls,Building codes; Buildings; Concrete blocks; Dynamic analysis; Earthquake engineering; Earthquakes; Geophysics; Losses; Masonry materials; Office buildings; Reinforced concrete; Risk assessment; Seismic design; Seismic waves; Seismology; Walls (structural partitions); Collapse; FEMA P-58; FEMA P-695; Fragility curves; Incremental dynamic analysis; Reinforced masonry; Seismic Performance; Structural walls; Structural design,0,0
12688,"This paper describes a web interface with GIS functionality (Web-GIS) that Eucentre (EUropean CENtre for Training and Research in Earthquake engineering) developed for SASPARM 2.0 (Support Action for Strengthening PAlestine capabilities for seismic Risk Mitigation) project [1]. The SASPARM 2.0 WebGIS is a simple and intuitive platform intended for people with different backgrounds, such as citizens, students, practitioners, governmental and non-governmental institutions. The final aim of the implemented WebGIS application is to calculate the seismic risk of residential buildings. Nablus has been taken as case study to demonstrate, implement, and calibrate project actions. To calculate the seismic risk, residential buildings data are collected. Such activity can be conducted by both practitioners and citizens who compile two standard forms that differ from each other only in terms of detail. The survey forms can be compiled directly on WebGIS, at the dedicated tabs, or through two mobile apps designed for the purpose. All filled forms are shown on the homepage map of the WebGIS platform. Starting from the collected data, the seismic risk of each single building is evaluated by combining the hazard and the vulnerability with its exposure. In particular, the seismic demand to which each building is subjected to is defined from the hazard curve. In the specific case study of Nablus, the hazard curve is obtained by referring to West Bank and Gaza Strip: Seismic Hazard Map Distribution. The structural vulnerability, instead, is quantified through fragility curves calculated with the mechanical method SP-BELA (Simplified Pushover-Based Earthquake Loss Assessment), modified to represent the building environment of Nablus.",Collecting and Managing Building Data to Perform Seismic Risk Assessment - Palestine Case Study,2017,Vulnerability assessment; Seismic risk; WebGIS platform; Mobile app,SCALE,0,0
12689,"Ground subsidence and surface cracks caused by coal mining are typical man-made geological hazards that can severely damage the ecological environment and buildings. In China, within the theme of sustained and stable development, accurate assessment of mining-related building damage is paramount in order to address the contradiction between coal mining enterprises and building owners. Previous research in China focused mainly on the mining areas of plains, and only a few studies have considered building damage caused by intensive mining in mountainous areas. First, based on field investigation, this study located ground surface cracks and assessed the damage to buildings in the village of Nanyetou in Shanxi Province (China) attributable to the exploitation of the 15110 working face of the Baiyangling coal mine. Second, based on the mining subsidence law and boundary angle, the surface influenced boundary caused by underground mining was determined. However, as the existing subsidence theory cannot adequately explain the phenomenon of building damage, the damage was investigated from the perspective of slope stability analysis, and the slope safety factor before and after working face mining were calculated using the Janbu method. The analytical results showed that slope instability due to a decrease of the safety factor because of the coal mining activity was the principal reason for damage to the village buildings, a finding that was confirmed by field survey and InSAR monitoring displacement. The results of this study could provide guidance and reference for the assessment of building damage caused by underground mining in mountain areas.",Combining subsidence theory and slope stability analysis method for building damage assessment in mountainous mining subsidence regions,2019,None,None,0,0
12690,"Building damage assessment is a critical task following major hurricane events. Use of remotely sensed data to support building damage assessment is a logical choice considering the difficulty of gaining ground access to the impacted areas immediately after hurricane events. However, a remote sensing based damage assessment approach is often only capable of detecting severely damaged buildings. In this study, an airborne LiDAR based approach is proposed to assess multi-level hurricane damage at the community scale. In the proposed approach, building clusters are first extracted using a density-based algorithm. A novel cluster matching algorithm is proposed to robustly match post-event and pre-event building clusters. Multiple features including roof area and volume, roof orientation, and roof shape are computed as building damage indicators. A hierarchical determination process is then employed to identify the extent of damage to each building object. The results of this study suggest that our proposed approach is capable of 1) recognizing building objects, 2) extracting damage features, and 3) characterizing the extent of damage to individual building properties.",Community-scale multi-level post-hurricane damage assessment of residential buildings using multi-temporal airborne LiDAR data,2019,Hurricane damage assessment; Airborne LiDAR; Point cloud processing; Data clustering; Geometric computing,SATELLITE STEREO IMAGERY; COLLAPSED BUILDINGS; COASTAL DUNES; RESOLUTION; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; DISASTER; AREAS,0,0
12693,"The damage index is a crucial parameter to determine whether the structure or component is failed after an earthquake and to assess the extent of the damage.It is also an important theoretical basis of safety assessment and restoration of the earthquake damaged buildings.This paper conducts a comparative analysis on seven representative damage models at home and abroad based on the experimental results of forty reinforced concrete columns.The results indicate that there is great difference between the damage indices obtained by different damage models in the same specimen, and the development trend of damage curves are also different.The energy-based damage models mainly show a upper convex trend of a rapid growth in the early stage but a slow growth in the later stage.In contrast, the two-parameter damage models based on the combination of deformation and energy mainly show a upper concave trend which performs a slow growth in the early stage but a rapid growth in the later stage.Park-Ang damage model and its improved form can reflect the damage development process at member level effectively, but they are not suitable for earthquake disaster assessment at structure level because of the numerous unknown parameters and complex calculation process.The damage models based on energy dissipation principle, which have less unknown parameters and simple calculation process, are in more accord with the nature of structure anti-earthquake performance, but further researches are still needed to fill the gap in the definition of boundary conditions. © 2018, Editorial Board of World Earthquake Engineering.

Spectral acceleration-displacement based damage assessments by alternating damage functions and inelastic demand evaluation methods are performed for high-code buildings in Istanbul. The buildings are mid- and high-rise, reinforced concrete, moment-resisting frames that are assumed to be designed in accordance with the provisions of Turkish Earthquake Resistant Design Code (1998). Three damage models, i.e. structural capacity and fragility curves, are employed for each building class: Expert judgment based capacity and fragility functions; HAZUS's high-code seismic design level capacity and fragility functions; and Capacity and fragility functions derived based on nonlinear analyses of code complying RC frames. Inelastic spectral displacement demands are computed with three methods: Capacity Spectrum Method, Modified Acceleration-Displacement Response Spectrum Method, and Displacement Coefficient Method. Analyses are realized under site-specific ground motions based on a state-of-the-art hazard model for eight return periods ranging from 100 to 2475 years as well as for an Mw = 7.5 scenario earthquake. Probabilistic loss curves for each case are developed. Estimated average annual losses (AAL) and loss ratios (AALR) are compared. Grid and district based maps illustrating the spatial distributions of estimated long term average losses per year and the loss ratios are presented.

12701,"The current generation of SAR satellites such as TerraSAR-X, TanDEM-X and COSMO-SkyMed provide resolutions below one meter, permitting the detailed analysis of urban areas while covering large zones. Furthermore, as they are deployable independently of daylight and weather, such remote sensing SAR data are particularly popular for purposes such as rapid damage assessment at building level after a natural disaster. The purpose of our study is the investigation of techniques for the detection of changes based on one pre-event and one post-event SAR amplitude image. We provide a comparison of several methods for detecting changes in urban areas. Especially, changes at building locations are looked for. We analyzed two areas affected differently in detail. First, a suburban area of Paris, France, was considered due to changes caused by an urbanization project. Here, we have two TanDEM-X acquisitions available, before (November 4, 2012) and after (May 10, 2013) the changes. Second, we investigated changes that happened in Kathmandu, Nepal, after the April 25, 2015 earthquake. For this analysis, we have two TerraSAR-X acquisitions, one before (October 13, 2013) and one immediately after (April 27, 2015) the earthquake. Both areas differ by the building types, the image resolution and the available reference, which makes it an interesting challenge. In this paper, we compare six different methods for change detection. The investigated methods contain both standard criteria such as Log Ratio, Kullback-Leibler and the Difference of Entropies detector, and methods developed by the authors such as a Log Ratio combined with an Alternating Sequential Filter.

12702,"Combining pre-disaster optical and post-disaster synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data is essential for the timely damage investigation because the availability of data in a disaster area is usually limited. This article proposes a novel method to assess damage in urban areas by analyzing combined pre-disaster very high resolution (VHR) optical data and post-disaster polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data, which has rarely been used in previous research because the two data have extremely different characteristics. To overcome these differences and effectively compare VHR optical data and PolSAR data, a technique to simulate polarization orientation angles (POAs) in built-up areas was developed using building orientations extracted from VHR optical data. The POA is an intrinsic parameter of PolSAR data and has a physical relationship with building orientation. A damage level indicator was also proposed, based on the consideration of diminished homogeneity of POA values by damaged buildings. The indicator is the difference between directional dispersions of the pre and post-disaster POA values. Damage assessment in urban areas was conducted by using the indicator calculated with the simulated pre-disaster POAs from VHR optical data and the derived post-disaster PolSAR POAs. The proposed method was validated on the case study of the 2011 tsunami in Japan using pre-disaster KOMPSAT-2 data and post-disaster ALOS/PALSAR-1 data. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method accurately simulated the POAs with a root mean square error (RMSE) value of 2.761° and successfully measured the level of damage in built-up areas. The proposed method can facilitate efficient and fast damage assessment in built-up areas by comparing pre-disaster VHR optical data and post-disaster PolSAR data. © 2018 by the authors.",Comparison of pre-event VHR optical data and post-event PolSAR data to investigate damage caused by the 2011 Japan Tsunami in built-up areas,2018,Damage assessment; Data fusion; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar; Polarization orientation angle; Very high resolution optical data,Data fusion; Disasters; Mean square error; Polarimeters; Polarization; Synthetic aperture radar; Tsunamis; Damage assessments; Damage investigation; Directional dispersions; Intrinsic parameters; Optical data; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radars; Polarization orientation angles; Root mean square errors; Damage detection,0,0
12703,"The need for verifying and/or validating the results of probabilistic seismic hazard studies has become evident, despite the absence of generally accepted methods for judging such results. This paper proposes a methodology for comparing the results of PSH with historical macroseismic observations, at different scale levels. The selected metric of the comparison is the mean damage, i.e. the average annually expected damage. Hence, a procedure for converting macroseismic observations and PGA levels, for which PSH estimates are provided, into mean damage values is first presented. The procedure is based on the macroseismic method for converting intensities into mean damage values, whereas it takes advantage of fragility curves (representative of the seismic vulnerability of the building stock at the time of historical observations) to transform the rates of occurrence of PGA values into the equivalent quantity in terms of mean damage. A methodology for site-specific comparison is first outlined. To overcome some of the limitations of the comparison at a single site, two procedures for aggregating several sites by sampling in space are then presented, with the aim of enlarging the available macroseismic dataset. Finally, a procedure for the comparison at the regional level is discussed. Applications of the proposed methodologies will be discussed in a companion paper (Rosti and Rota in Bull Earthq Eng, 2017).",Comparison of PSH results with historical macroseismic observations at different scales.

12705,"High-strength, lightweight concrete materials have been widely used in many building structures, while the dynamic behaviors under high-strain-rate loading are not well understood. Two groups of high-strength, lightweight concrete specimens were cast for static and dynamic tests. The compressive strengths and densities of the specimens were 39.6 N/mm(2) and 1.3 t/m(3), respectively. Specimens with length-to-diameter ratios of 0.5 and 150-mm-diameter were tested using a 155-mm-diameter split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB). A copper disc was applied as the pulse shaper, and the resulting impact velocity was proven to be stable in each test scenario. The damage mode of the concrete specimens was brittle failure, and fragments with different sizes were generated after each impact. The higher the impact velocity was, the smaller the sizes of the fragments became. A representative stress-strain curve was developed based on the geometric shape of the observed curve for each specimen. The dynamic strength generally increased with the impact velocity for strain rates ranging from 40 to 140 s(-1). A new profile consisting of one parabola and two straight lines was developed to represent the experimental dynamic increase factor. The energy absorption density and fragility curves were computed to understand the energy absorption and fragility properties of the specimens.",Compressive impact tests of lightweight concrete with 155-mm-diameter spilt hopkinson pressure bar,2020,Light weight; Concrete; SHPB; Impact; Strain rate; Strength; Fragility,FIBER-REINFORCED CONCRETE; PULSE SHAPING TECHNIQUES; WET-MIX SHOTCRETE; STRAIN-RATE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; DYNAMIC FRAGMENTATION; SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS; AGGREGATE CONCRETE; FRAGILITY ANALYSIS; FLY-ASH,0,0
12706,"Two series of load-bearing horizontal-hole interlocking hollow concrete blocks, referred to as H-shaped series and cross-shaped series, were developed, including three geometric types: type BH-290 (H-shaped), type BH-240 (H-shaped), and type BC-240 (cross-shaped). The research presented in this article investigated the compressive behavior of the proposed load-bearing horizontal-hole interlocking hollow concrete blocks and aimed at analyzing the influence of geometric parameters on the block capacity. First, compressive tests of the horizontal-hole interlocking hollow concrete blocks were carried out. The compressive strength, elastic modulus, and compressive failure mechanism were analyzed. Second, the feasibility of the finite element analysis model was verified by experimental results presented in this article, as well as by available test data from other researchers. The influences of vertical ribs, horizontal ribs, and concrete strength on the compressive strength of horizontal-hole interlocking hollow concrete blocks were investigated. Ultimately, based on the numerical modeling results, linear equations were proposed to predict the compressive strength of H-shaped series and cross-shaped series blocks. The results show that the compressive strengths of types BH-240, BH-290, and BC-240 are 15.9, 13.4, and 13.0 MPa, respectively. For the H-shaped series, the core horizontal rib is the key part that can significantly constrain the vertical ribs so that the block can achieve higher compressive bearing capacity. For the cross-shaped series, core horizontal ribs cannot improve the compressive strength of the block because core horizontal ribs and joints near them become damaged early. Improving the concrete strength and the width of the vertical rib can effectively improve the compressive bearing capacity for both H-shaped and cross-shaped series blocks. The accuracy of the proposed equations for predicting the compressive strength of H-shaped and cross-shaped blocks is acceptable, according to the current verification.",Compressive performance of new types of load-bearing horizontal-hole interlocking concrete hollow blocks,2019,compressive strength; finite element model; horizontal-hole interlocking concrete hollow block,PLASTIC-DAMAGE MODEL; MASONRY; BUILDINGS; CONSTRUCTION; DESIGN; SHAPE,0,0

12708,"Masonry structures constitute a large portion of the built heritage around the world, from the past until today. Therefore, understanding their structural behavior is crucial for preserving the historical characteristics of many buildings and in addressing the requirements for housing and sustainable development. Due to its composite and highly nonlinear nature, the analysis of masonry structures has been a challenge for engineers. This article presents a set of advancedmodels for the mechanical study of masonry, including the usual micro-modeling approaches (the masonry constituents, unit and joint, are represented separately), macro-modeling (masonry constituents are smeared in a homogeneous composite), and multi-scale techniques (upscaling from micro to macro is adopted). An extensive overview of its computational features is provided. The engineering application of such strategies is presented and covers problems from the masonry components level (meso-scale) to the structural element itself, and ultimately to the level of monumental buildings (super-large).

To investigate the effect of mechanical stress on thermal conduction, a computational homogenization method from a mesoscopic perspective was proposed in the present work. In the simulations, concrete was considered as a three-phase composite material consisting of aggregate, mortar matrix and the interfacial transition zones (ITZs) between them. The mechanical analysis was conducted firstly to study the damage distribution within concrete. The outcomes of mechanical computation were then used as the initial input data in the thermal conduction computation. The equivalent thermal conductivity of damaged element was homogenized by a composite mechanical method based on damage and the initial thermal conductivity of sound material. Accordingly, a meso-scale model in which the mechanical and thermal behavior were one-way coupled was built. The method was calibrated by comparing the numerical results with the available experimentally measured ones. Based on the verified simulation method, effective thermal conductivity (ETC) and temperature field of concrete subjected to different loading levels were calculated. Besides, the effects of loading type (compressive and tensile loadings) on ETC and temperature field of concrete were studied. It is found that ETC of concrete decreases with an increasing loading level. In addition, the effect of tensile loading on thermal behavior depends on whether the direction of thermal conduction is parallel or perpendicular to loadings. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

12711,"In this study, constant-damage yield strength spectrum (CDYSS), which is defined as the yield strength demand of a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system of varying natural vibration period with the target constant damage index and specified ductility capacity, is derived by averaging the nonlinear time-history analysis results of a SDOF system under different earthquake ground motions. A modified Park-Ang damage model proposed by the authors, eliminating its non-convergence problem both at upper and lower limits with higher precision and smaller scatter, is adopted to calculate the damage index of the SDOF system. In the construction of CDYSS, 641 sets of earthquake ground motion records are adopted and classified into 12 groups in line with Chinese code for seismic design of buildings. The yield strength demands of SDOF systems with given ductility capacity are obtained through trial and error method. Then, the mean CDYSS and the corresponding coefficient of variation for different group of site soil conditions are calculated.

12713,"Since the 1990s, the recordings of ambient vibrations in structures have gained interest in the civil engineering community due to technological improvements of portable sensors, allowing the recordings of small amplitude vibrations, and the possibility of processing a large amount of data even in real time. Many applications, based on the analysis of seismic noise, exist in the literature for checking the serviceability limit state of existing construction in the case of earthquakes. These applications can be extended to the case of occurrence of induced and triggered seismicity and its potential impact on the built environment. The latter impact has heightened both public concern and regulatory scrutiny, emphasizing the need for an integrated risk management framework. Considering the case of induced seismicity, the vulnerability assessment requires the expected damage to refer to non-structural components. In this study, some historical masonry buildings located in Alsace France are considered and the dynamic characteristics of these structures were estimated by the analysis of seismic noise recordings by sensors installed at each floor of the buildings under study. The estimated dynamic properties for small amplitude vibrations of these historical structures were used to derive simplified vulnerability models. Moreover, the Eurocode 8 defines the interstory drift limit of a building for non-structural damage, by looking at its displacement-sensitive nonstructural components at the serviceability limit state. Therefore, by adopting these limits and the developed simplified vulnerability models, new fragility curves for typical historical masonry building types dominant in the region under study are proposed. The fragility curves have been calculated using incremental dynamic analysis for the seismic demands generally imposed upon linear and slightly non-linear models of single and multiple degrees of freedom, which is the case for the effects of induced seismicity. These results will prove useful for both local end-users and industrial stakeholders, with a clear perspective for a better understanding of the risk related to induced and triggered seismicity and its sound management. © 2020 European Association for Structural Dynamics.

12714,"The Wenchuan Earthquake with a magnitude of Ms 8.0 struck the Sichuan province of China on May 12, 2008, where it mainly affected the area along the Longmenshan fault. In total, 420 three-component acceleration records were obtained by the China Strong Motion Networks Centre during this seismic event, among which over 50 records exceeded 100. gal. In the present study, we collected 48 near-fault acceleration records to derive strong ground motion parameters in terms of the peak ground acceleration, peak ground velocity, peak spectrum acceleration (5% of the damping ratio) and spectrum intensity (5% of damping ratio). We determined the building collapse ratios (CRs) for 20 targeted districts based on data acquired from both the China Earthquake Administration and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, where the CRs combined the data for all building types. Fragility curves were established between the CRs and the corresponding ground motion parameters, based on which the damage criteria were proposed. In particular, we derived the fragility curves for brick-concrete structures and frame-structures. These curves indicate how different structural types can determine the damage sustained. In addition, we developed a method for estimating building damage classifications. If we assume that buildings are built according to the improved Seismic Fortification Criterion in the revised ""Code for Seismic Design of Buildings"", the predicted CRs for the 20 targeted districts would be significantly lower compared with the actual damage they sustained, which illustrates the validity of both the method and the revised code. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Correlations between structural damage and ground motion parameters during the Ms8.0 Wenchuan Earthquake,2015,Collapse ratio; Seismic coefficient; Strong ground motion characteristics; Structural anti-seismic performance; Vulnerability; Wenchuan earthquake,Buildings; Damping; Earthquake effects; Faulting; Seismic design; Seismic response; Seismic waves; Seismology; Structural analysis; Antiseismic performance; Collapse ratios; Seismic coefficient; Strong ground motion; Vulnerability; Wenchuan Earthquake; Earthquakes; building; building code; damping; earthquake damage; fault; ground motion; peak acceleration; Sichuan earthquake 2008; structural response; vulnerability; China; Sichuan,0,0
12715,"The early stages of the design process of wind-excited tall buildings involve several decisions on structural typology, shape, orientation, optional control system, and type and distribution of nonstructural elements. Focusing on this last aspect, the main issue addressed in this paper is a systematic comparative cost-based analysis accounting for the damage at the nonstructural system level induced by extreme wind loads. This design task is accomplished in this study by making use of a cost-based decision framework developed by the authors, designated life cycle cost wind design (LCCWD), specifically tailored for wind-excited tall buildings. Various design configurations are investigated by comparing the lifetime cost induced by wind-load damage as evaluated by adaptation of the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center (PEER) equation, which was originally conceived for seismic engineering. This choice emphasizes the role of a multihazard-inspired design process. The following items are jointly considered: (1) uncertainties in wind-load characterization, structural response, and damage models; (2) wind directionality; (3) dynamic response model accounting for non-shear-type vibration modes and torsional effects; and (4) monetary loss accumulation by partitioning nonstructural damage effects among various building components. Furthermore, the LCCWD is expanded to include internalization of external costs, whereby acceleration-based perception effects on occupants' comfort lead to business interruptions and consequent downtime losses; these items at are included as indirect costs. Application of the procedure to a case study enables automated, systematic, and cost-effective comparison of various design alternatives. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Cost-Based Design of Nonstructural Elements for Tall Buildings under Extreme Wind Environments,2019,Elemental-level cost accumulation; High-rise buildings; Nonstructural damage; Wind loads,Aerodynamic loads; Architectural design; Cost effectiveness; Cost engineering; Costs; Life cycle; Seismic design; Shear flow; Tall buildings; Vibrations (mechanical); Wind stress; Dynamic response model; Elemental-level cost accumulation; High rise building; Internalization of external costs; Non-structural damage; Non-structural elements; Pacific earthquake engineering research centers; Wind load; Cost benefit analysis,0,0
12717,"This study developed a coupled thermomechanical damage model for structural steel at elevated temperatures. The need for adequate modelling of steel deterioration behavior remains a challenging task in structural fire engineering because of the complexity inherent in the damage states of steel under combined actions of mechanical and fire loading. A fully three-dimensional damage-coupled constitutive model was developed based on the hypothesis of effective stress space and isotropic damage theory. The new coupling model, adapted from an enhanced Lemaitre's ductile damage equation and taking into account temperature-dependent thermal degradation, is a heuristic approach which retains the underlying mechanisms that govern the damage processes. The proposed damage model comprises a limited number of parameters that can be identified using unloading slopes of stress-strain relationships through tensile coupon tests. The proposed damage model was successfully implemented in finite-element software and validated against a comprehensive range of experimental results. The damage-Affected structural response was accurately reproduced under various loading conditions and a wide temperature range, demonstrating that the proposed damage model is a useful tool in giving a realistic representation of steel deterioration behavior for structural fire engineering applications. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Coupled Thermomechanical Damage Modeling for Structural Steel in Fire Conditions,2020,None,Building materials; Deterioration; Heuristic methods; Steel beams and girders; Steel construction; Stress-strain curves; Unloading; Coupled thermo-mechanical; Elevated temperature; Finite element software; Stress-strain relationships; Structural fire engineering; Structural response; Temperature dependent; Wide temperature ranges; Fires,0,0
12718,"Post-earthquake observations have outlined the poor seismic performance of substandard reinforced concrete (RC) beam-column joints in existing buildings. They often exhibit significant cracking even under moderate intensity earthquakes, compromising the seismic performance of the entire building. This makes the quantification of their residual capacity and the definition of reliable repairability thresholds critical. Different approaches are available in the literature to establish the repairability of RC joints. However, a simple crack width-based criterion is required for practitioners during in-situ inspections. This study deals with the definition of crack width-based fragility curves relying on numerical analyses. Those are carried out by using the validated finite element (FE) models, being capable of reproducing the initiation and development of cracks in RC joints. To this end, the uncertainties in material properties, influencing the seismic performance of structural components, are accounted for different joints. In particular, experimentally validated FE models are evolved to stochastic level by generating random variables of material properties with the stratified sampling scheme. Fragility curves representing a certain level of probability of exceeding the defined crack width at the joint back, joint core, and beam-to-joint interface are developed. An application of the proposed methodology for in-situ inspections is also presented, and the results of in-situ measurements of residual crack width from real buildings damaged by recent earthquakes are used for the validation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Crack width-based fragility curves for repairability of substandard beam-column joints,2021,Existing buildings; Fragility; Joint; Repairability; Residual crack; Substandard,Concrete beams and girders; Reinforced concrete; Seismic waves; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Beam-column joints; Earthquake observations; In-situ measurement; Reinforced concrete beams; Residual capacity; Seismic Performance; Stratified sampling; Structural component; Earthquakes,0,0
12719,"Buildings have a multifunctional character, which makes it hard to define just one model for all their diverse functions. As these diverse functions are addressed by actors of different perspectives and domain backgrounds, the possibility to exchange available building information would be desirable. Two main models for the creation of building information are Industry Foundation Classes/Building Information Modelling (IFC/BIM) and City Geography Markup Language (CityGML). As the importance of information interchange has been recognized, several authors have tried to develop intermediate models for the information exchange between IFC/BIM and CityGML, e.g., the Unified Building Model (UBM), the BIM Oriented Indoor data Model (BO-IDM), the Indoor Emergency Spatial Model (IESM) and the BIM-GIS integration model for Flood Damage Assessment (FDA model). Nevertheless, all these models have been created with a certain use in mind. Our focus in this article is to identify common elements amongst these proposed models and to combine them into one “core model” that is as simple as possible, while simultaneously containing all important elements. Furthermore, this base model extracted from proposed intermediate models can then be expanded to serve specific use requirements, while still being exchangeable. To show this cross-domain character of the core model, we validated the resulting model with two cases of use (production environment/maintenance and 3D digital cadaster). © 2018 by the authors.",Cross-domain building models — A step towards interoperability,2018,BIM; Building information modelling; CityGML; Core model; Cross-domain; Geospatial model; IFC; Multi-purpose,None,0,0
12720,"Crowdsourced analysis of satellite and aerial imagery has emerged as a new mechanism to assess post-disaster impact in the past decade. Compared to standard ground-based damage assessments, crowdsourcing initiatives rapidly process extensive data over a large spatial extent, but utilization has been limited due to uncertainty in the results. New methods for crowdsourced satelliteimagery- based damage assessment were assessed through three test approaches. Approach 1 further develops the predominant building-by-building map-based assessment method. Two novel area-based assessment approaches were implemented, where users rate the level of building damage in an image in Approach 2 and compare building damage between two images in Approach 3. Preliminary results from statistical aggregation and regression models indicate that crowdsourced volunteers can visually identify building damage in images on an aggregated, as opposed to building-by-building basis. The correlation between crowd-identified and true damage can be further improved by weighting responses based on user and image characteristics. Results show promise in a novel method of crowdsourcing damage using area-based assessments, which addresses decision-makers' need for aggregated post-disaster loss estimates in a rapid timeframe. © 11th National Conference on Earthquake Engineering 2018.

12723,"This research presents an experimental and numerical study focusing on the compression test of cylindrical samples core drilled from existing masonry walls. This method is suitable for the minor destructive assessment of the mechanical properties of historical masonry, like that composed of aerial lime mortar joints and solid clay bricks. This particular material combination, frequently found in the vast majority of the built cultural heritage, was utilized to build representative specimens that were stored in the laboratory for one year until their testing. Cylindrical samples of 150?mm diameter were extracted from the masonry walls by using a dry core-drilling procedure, and then regularized to be tested under compression in the laboratory. A comparison is presented between the experimental results on cylindrical samples and those obtained from standard compression tests on prismatic samples consisting in stack bond prisms. Numerical simulations by finite element micro-modelling of the compression tests on the core samples were carried out to investigate the experimental behaviour of the specimens and evaluate the compressive strength of the material from this nonstandard technique. The combined experimental and numerical study allows the assessment of important mechanical parameters for the compressive characterisation of masonry composed of aerial lime mortar joints and solid clay bricks.

In this study, UAV flights were carried out by the authors over various damage sites due to the 2016 Kumamoto, Japan earthquake, such as surface faulting, overturned tombstones, landslides, collapsed buildings and a bridge. The UAV flights captured high-resolution video footages and photos, and using them, three-dimensional (3D) models were developed based on a SfM (Structure-from-Motion) technique.

12727,"The preservation (in terms of inhibition of failures and collapses) of architectural heritage against horizontal loads (such as earthquakes) requires an accurate assessment of the non-linear response up to failure: to this aim, the use of advanced numerical tools to perform three-dimensional non-linear dynamic analyses is fundamental. This paper investigates the performance (up to the activation of local failures and under horizontal loads) of three historical masonry palaces of the outstanding cultural heritage in Mantua (Northern Italy) after the 2012 Emilia earthquake. Despite the unquestionable importance of the three case studies, until now these palaces have not been studied with advanced numerical simulations; moreover, the recent seismic sequence and the consequent significant cracks patterns observed in the post-earthquake survey phase have pointed out their vulnerability even to small seismic actions. The first part of the study was addressed to an accurate knowledge of the three palaces, focusing especially on the information gathered during on-site surveys, bibliographical and historical research: the data collected were employed to detect the complex three-dimensional geometry of the palaces under study and to define the cracks patterns. In the second part of the study, detailed and representative three-dimensional finite element (FE) models of the structures were developed and non-linear dynamic analyses were carried out to obtain a deep numerical insight into the seismic response of the three palaces, identifying the most vulnerable elements for each structure. The comparison between the numerical results and the damage survey showed that the numerical approach used in this study may be an adequate tool to properly evaluate the seismic response of historical masonry buildings. A comparative assessment of the results obtained for the different palaces was performed in terms of predicted damage distributions, energy density dissipated by tensile damage and maximum displacements registered for the different macro-elements. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Damage assessment and collapse investigation of three historical masonry palaces under seismic actions,2019,crack pattern; damage distribution; failure mechanism; historical masonry palace; non-linear dynamic analysis,Buildings; Concrete beams and girders; Damage detection; Earthquakes; Seismic response; Surveys; Crack patterns; Damage distribution; Failure mechanism; historical masonry palace; Non-linear dynamic analysis; Failure (mechanical),0,0
12728,"The structural safety and seismic performance assessment of historical masonry churches belonging to cultural heritage is currently a topic of increasing interest in Italy. Recent Italian seismic events have proved that severe damage or collapse can be caused to such typology of structures even by earthquakes of small-to-moderate magnitude. This paper describes the damage occurred in three important historical masonry churches of the outstanding cultural heritage in Mantua, Northern Italy, after the 2012 Emilia earthquake and presents the results of extensive numerical investigations carried out on detailed FE models with an elasto-plastic damage constitutive law for masonry. Historical and documentary research, on-site surveys and visual inspections were fundamental to identify the critical elements and obtain a thorough detailed knowledge of the churches for the development of accurate numerical models. The results of advanced FE analyses were used to investigate the causes of the crack patterns observed after the earthquake, indicating that the damage distribution detected in the churches can be simulated satisfactorily by the numerical approach adopted. Moreover, this study provides additional information on the seismic response of the three churches analyzed under higher PGA than those registered in Mantua during the 2012 Emilia earthquake. Comparisons among the seismic response of the churches are made in terms of predicted damage distribution, maximum normalized displacements and energy density dissipated by tensile damage. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Damage assessment and partial failure mechanisms activation of historical masonry churches under seismic actions: Three case studies in Mantua,2018,Damage assessment; Full 3D FE model; Historical masonry church; Non-linear dynamic analysis; Seismic response,Earthquake engineering; Earthquakes; Masonry materials; Religious buildings; Seismic response; Structural analysis; 3-D FE models; Damage assessments; Elasto-plastic damage; Masonry churches; Non-linear dynamic analysis; Normalized displacements; Numerical investigations; Seismic performance assessment; Damage detection,0,0

12730,"Flash floods are caused by intense rainfall events and represent an insufficiently understood phenomenon in Germany. As a result of higher precipitation intensities, flash floods might occur more frequently in future. In combination with changing land use patterns and urbanisation, damage mitigation, insurance and risk management in flash-flood-prone regions are becoming increasingly important. However, a better understanding of damage caused by flash floods requires ex post collection of relevant but yet sparsely available information for research. At the end of May 2016, very high and concentrated rainfall intensities led to severe flash floods in several southern German municipalities. The small town of Braunsbach stood as a prime example of the devastating potential of such events. Eight to ten days after the flash flood event, damage assessment and data collection were conducted in Braunsbach by investigating all affected buildings and their surroundings. To record and store the data on site, the open-source software bundle KoBoCollect was used as an efficient and easy way to gather information. Since the damage driving factors of flash floods are expected to differ from those of riverine flooding, a post-hoc data analysis was performed, aiming to identify the influence of flood processes and building attributes on damage grades, which reflect the extent of structural damage. Data analyses include the application of random forest, a random general linear model and multinomial logistic regression as well as the construction of a local impact map to reveal influences on the damage grades. Further, a Spearman's Rho correlation matrix was calculated. The results reveal that the damage driving factors of flash floods differ from those of riverine floods to a certain extent. The exposition of a building in flow direction shows an especially strong correlation with the damage grade and has a high predictive power within the constructed damage models. Additionally, the results suggest that building materials as well as various building aspects, such as the existence of a shop window and the surroundings, might have an effect on the resulting damage. To verify and confirm the outcomes as well as to support future mitigation strategies, risk management and planning, more comprehensive and systematic data collection is necessary.",Damage assessment in Braunsbach 2016: data collection and analysis for an improved understanding of damaging processes during flash floods,2017,None,MAI 29TH; FLOW; VULNERABILITY; 2016-ORIGIN; PATHWAYS; GERMANY; IMPACTS; MODEL,0,0

In this study, the Park-Ang damage index has been developed in MATLAB platform to quantify the damage level for steel moment-resisting frames.

12733,"Historical seismic damage data show that most strong earthquakes are accompanied by multiple intense aftershocks. In general, the time interval between the main shock and the aftershocks is relatively short, and structure repair work is often not completed before the aftershocks occur. For a structure that has suffered damage from the main shock, the aftershock will further aggravate the damage and even cause complete collapse. Based on the incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) method, this paper establishes a probabilistic seismic demand model for the SRC framework-core tube structure and plots the vulnerability curve of a structure under the action of the main aftershock sequence, which occurs following the actions of frequent earthquakes, fortification earthquakes, and rare earthquakes. The structure vulnerability matrix and the vulnerability index are used to evaluate the seismic performance of a structure. This study found that the occurrence of aftershocks leads the structure to a more unfavourable failure state. Taking the vulnerability index as an evaluation parameter, the structural vulnerability index when subjected to an intensity 8 earthquake under the action of the main aftershock is approximately 10% larger than under the action of a single main shock. Meanwhile, the SRC frame-core structure designed according to the current Chinese specifications meets the expected seismic fortification target, even after being acted upon by the main aftershock ground motion sequence.",Damage Assessment of an SRC Frame-Core Tube Structure under the Action of a Main Aftershock Sequence,2020,None,VULNERABILITY CURVES; MULTIPLE,0,0
12734,"The majority of Turkey?s geography is at risk of earthquakes. Within the borders of Turkey, including the two major active faults contain the North-Eastern and Eastern Anatolia, earthquake, threatening the safety of life and property. On January 24, 2020, an earthquake of magnitude 6.8 occurred at 8:55 p.m. local time. According to the data obtained from the stations in the region, peak ground acceleration in the east-west direction was measured as 0.292 g from the 2308 coded station in Sivrice. It is thought that the earthquake with a magnitude of Mw 6.8 was developed on the Sivrice-Puturge segment of the Eastern Anatolian Fault, which is a left lateral strike slip fault, and the tear developed in an area of 50-55 km. Aftershocks ranging from 0.8 to 5.1 Mw occurred following the main shock on the Eastern Anatolian Fault. The earthquake caused severe structural damages in Elazi? and neighboring provinces. As a result of the field investigations carried out in this study, significant damage levels were observed in the buildings since it did not meet the criteria in the earthquake codes. Within the study's scope, the structural damage cases in reinforced concrete and masonry structures were investigated. Many structural deficiencies and mistakes such as non-ductile details, poor concrete quality, short columns, strong beams?weak columns mechanism, large and heavy overhangs, masonry building damages and inadequate reinforcement arrangements were observed.

12735,"The trend of adopting architectural designs with irregularities in elevation, meaning that the shape of the building is irregular, is on the increase. Seismically deficient structures are found in abundance in developing countries such as Pakistan, and structures with irregularities in elevation may result in failures due to sudden changes in stiffness, mass or strength along the building height. The aim of the work reported in this paper was to develop analytical seismic vulnerability curves for deficient mid-rise reinforced concrete building frames with setbacks. The vulnerability curves were derived by adopting a framework used in a previous study. Along with a regular frame, six-storey frames with different setback configurations were considered. The frames were modelled using the numerical analysis program Drain-3DX and their responses were estimated by generating force-displacement envelopes using non-linear static analysis. The response spectrum of the Uniform Building Code was used to impose a seismic demand. The hazard levels were evaluated at every point of the capacity envelope using a reverse procedure of Fema 440. The damage in the studied building frames was quantified through a direct correlation with the natural period of vibration of the buildings, as suggested in previous studies.

12736,"A crucial element of a tunnel lining design in metro tunnels is the time and the way till the final lining will begin to spall due to the high temperatures, which may be developed during a fire. Although the structural elements of the tunnel lining are considered inflamable, in a real fire situation the concrete lining can be spalled largely, sometimes perhaps entirely, with very serious consequences on cost and safety of people. The spalling rate of concrete as well as the spalling depth are two main values that cannot be measured since they are affected by a series of factors including mechanical properties, permeability of concrete and age of concrete. A lot of research has taken place in order to calculate the spalling of the concrete using numerical models, which however is not validated sufficiently by the test results. So the target of the specific research is to investigate experimentally the rate and the depth of spalling for several types of concrete under high temperatures. On this purpose specimen of all types of concrete that can be found in metro tunnels were manufactured and exposed at high temperature in a special furnace which has the ability to simulate all kind of fire scenarios and at the same time monitor the spalling depth and time. The temperature of the exposure was selected after modelling of a 25 MW fire in a metro tunnel. The modelling simulated the distribution of the temperature along the tunnel in case of a 25MW fire and representative values of the temperature for 10, 20, 50 and 100m away from the fire ignition were selected. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",Damage assessment of final linings in metro tunnels due to fire action,2019,None,Damage detection; Fires; Mechanical permeability; Office buildings; Spalling; Subways; Tunnel linings; Concrete linings; Damage assessments; Fire scenarios; High temperature; Metro tunnel; Real fire; Representative values; Structural elements; Concretes,0,0

12738,"To comprehend the seismic vulnerability of a particular region, seismic damage assessment of a large number of buildings needs to be conducted. However, a realistic representation of structural damage can only be obtained through post-earthquake field observations and reconnaissance survey reports. Post-earthquake damage survey reports for Nepal (Gorkha) earthquake (2015) and Imphal (India) earthquake (2016) presented in this study are utilized to give an overall idea about the nature of seismic damage prevalent for the widespread civil engineering infrastructural developments in the particular geographical regions. Further, the study applies the existing rapid visual screening (RVS) schemes for predicting seismic vulnerability of the structures to judge the sanctity of the schemes. An extensive state-of-the-art review of the existing RVS schemes reported in the literature is presented. A comparative study exhibiting the efficacy of the existing RVS schemes is conducted on the basis of damage survey reports obtained from the Nepal and Imphal earthquakes. Finally, a modified RVS scheme is proposed here for seismic damage assessment of masonry and low-rise reinforced concrete buildings located in hilly regions of the Indian subcontinent and other developing countries.

12739,"The 2014 Kashmir floods caused widespread damage in the valley of Kashmir, particularly in the city of Srinagar, and had a significant socioeconomic impact. Around 175,000 residential houses were damaged in the valley. Recent studies focusing on the flood-hazard that the Jhelum river poses have shown that a flood event with a return period of five or more years is likely to cause overflowing in the river. As such, policy decisions regarding flood safety are rather important. This paper seeks to inform such future policy decisions from a structural engineering point of view by presenting results from a survey of damaged houses in an area of Srinagar city. The surveyed houses are classified based on construction type and material, exposure level, and age for an adequate interpretation of results. A rational and easy-to-use method of quantifying damage using a damage index scale is proposed and used in this study. Damage index values evaluated using the proposed method are found to correlate well with actual damage in surveyed structures. 80% of the surveyed houses were submerged to more than half of their heights and nearly 20% were found to be completely collapsed. Houses with mud mortar, and timber as the material for beams, slabs and plinth were the found to be most damaged, while houses with cement mortar having a damp proof course and reinforced cement concrete beams and slabs were found to have performed well. It is emphasized that structural design in Kashmir has to account for seismic forces as well, and that any guideline thereof needs to take into account both hazards-floods as well as earthquakes.",Damage assessment of residential constructions in post-flood scenarios: a case of 2014 Kashmir floods,2021,Kashmir floods; Damage index; River Jhelum; Construction materials,INDEX; BUILDINGS,0,0
12740,"Reinforced concrete (RC) frame-shear wall structures are extensively used in urban areas. As a major part of the lateral load resisting system, the shear wall is a key component for the seismic performance assessment of such structures. In this study, a method for the seismic damage assessment of shear wall components is proposed by using the story curvature as the engineering demand parameter (EDP). The method involves (1) a shear wall story curvature calculation method and (2) a shear wall damage limit determination method that uses the story curvatures as the EDP. The story curvature adopted in this study denotes the maximum shear wall curvature within each story level. Based on the piecewise linear assumption of the curvature distribution, the story curvature calculation method requires story drifts and shear wall key design parameters as inputs. Meanwhile, based on the plane cross-sectional assumption and sectional analysis, the damage limits can be determined by considering the influences of the shear wall key design parameters, such as the axial load ratio, shear wall component length, and material information, thereby yielding more accurate estimation. Finally, the proposed method is validated by comparing it with the numerical results of several wall panels and an RC frame-shear wall structure. It is further validated by comparing it with the experiment results obtained from six shear wall tests and a full-scale shaking table test of a seven-story shear wall structure.",Damage assessment of shear wall components for RC frame-shear wall buildings using story curvature as engineering demand parameter,2019,RC shear wall; Story curvature; Damage assessment; Sectional analysis,AXIAL LOAD; CONCRETE; SIMULATION; BEHAVIOR; MODELS,0,0
12741,"On May 31st, 2019, a tornado hit the city of Talcahuano, Chile, generating significant damage to structures and leaving one person dead. The objective of the present paper is to report on damage to structures in Talcahuano. A preliminary survey was performed by the Municipality of Talcahuano and covered the entire affected area with a cellphone web application used to report the severity and distribution of damage. A more comprehensive damage survey was conducted in the Brisa del Sol neighborhood in the Medio Camino area by the UCSC team to assess the damage distribution within an area with well-defined and homogeneous building typologies. The results of the field surveys showed that the tornado behaved as a skipping tornado and that most damage to houses consisted of wall opening damage, roof sheathing failure, and wall cover removal (EF0), followed by partial roof removal (EF1). It was noticeable that self-built systems (house additions) were more damaged than original houses, which may be explained by the fact that such structures do not always meet minimum building standards. It is recommended that field surveys conducted by municipalities and the Ministry of Social Development consider typical damage types rather than just categories such as minor, moderate, or major. Finally, it is recommended that the feasibility of implementing mitigation measures such as stricter wind load provisions and dual-objective tornado design philosophy in the Concepción-Talcahuano area be analyzed. © 2020 The Author(s)","Damage assessment of the May 31st, 2019, Talcahuano tornado, Chile",2020,Damage assessment; Field survey; Talcahuano; Tornado,None,0,0
12742,"The architectural heritage was severely damaged by the seismic sequence that occurred in Emilia (Northern Italy) in May 2012. This paper investigates the seismic behavior of three masonry churches that were damaged by the 2012 Emilia earthquake. The analyzed churches are located in the South-East area of the province of Mantua: they are representative of some churches, denoted as “Matildic churches”, belonging to the territorial area between Lombardia, Emilia Romagna and Toscana and built during the Matilde di Canossa domain, between the X and the XI centuries. The study was based on detailed field surveys, in situ tests, visual inspections and existing archives in order to obtain an accurate knowledge of the churches and a proper evaluation of the damage caused by the earthquake. Then, detailed finite element models of the churches were developed and non-linear dynamic analyses with different peak ground accelerations were performed. The numerical simulations provided a deep insight into the seismic behavior of the analyzed churches, identifying the damage patterns and the main collapse mechanisms for different seismic intensity levels. The obtained results appear to be in a good agreement with the damage experienced by the churches during the earthquake. This study can be considered as a first step to assess the seismic vulnerability of the “Matildic churches”, extremely important for their historical and architectural value. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Damage assessment of three medieval churches after the 2012 Emilia earthquake,2017,Crack pattern; Damage; FE model; Field survey; Masonry church; Non-linear dynamic analysis,Damage detection; Dynamic analysis; Finite element method; Geophysics; Masonry materials; Religious buildings; Seismic response; Seismology; Surveys; Crack patterns; Damage; FE model; Field surveys; Masonry churches; Non-linear dynamic analysis; Earthquakes; building; Classic period; crack; damage mechanics; earthquake damage; earthquake intensity; field survey; finite element method; ground motion; hazard assessment; peak acceleration; seismic response; Italy; Lombardy; Emilia,0,0

An important aim of such field data analysis is establishing a better understanding of building performance such as causes of building failures. These lessons provide essential basis to improve our design codes, develop regulations and policies, to increase building resilience by addressing the infrastructure vulnerability. Currently, to make use of the datasets from around the world, significant effort is required to decode the data which often have unique local and regional context and bias. The struggle begins at data collection where there is a lack of consistent methodology and definitions that can adequately cover the regional nuance. This manuscript proposes a new paper-based tool which addresses the need for a global yet detailed universal methodology for building damage assessment post-earthquakes. The new form is based on the GEM taxonomy v2.0 and the European Macroseismic Scale EMS-98. The recent Mexican earthquake from the 19 September 2017 led to significant building damage in the capital Mexico City and the state of Morelos. A team from New Zealand assessed damage throughout the capital and tested the new paper form in Calle La Morena. The street case study presents a novel visualization of the damage data and buildings characteristics which highlights the correlation between the damage and the building features. It is hoped that this kind of illustration will lead to better comprehension of the damage drivers. © 2018 Roeslin, Ma and García.","Damage assessment on buildings following the 19th september 2017 puebla, Mexico earthquake",2018,2017 Puebla earthquake; Building damage; European Macroseismic Scale EMS-98; Global Earthquake Model (GEM); Seismic assessment forms; Seismic damage assessment,None,0,0
12744,"The seismic behavior of a representative medium-rise building of Mexico City is evaluated using the capacity spectrum method. This method is widely used in the seismic assessment of buildings because it allows obtaining fragility curves which permit evaluating the ability of a building to resist earthquakes. A real full-height multistory model is proposed to test the capabilities of the algorithm exhibited. The model is outlined through structural drawings sized and structured in accordance with building code regulations for masonry structures in Mexico City. Computational requirements for the analysis of large structures are indicated in addition to improvements to a nonlinear computing code for better performance in terms of memory management and execution times. Finally, a comparison of obtained results and building code regulations is carried out, highlighting differences in the obtained results. The need to handle meshes with a high number of finite elements (FEs) led to development of a new layered finite element that can reproduce the nonlinear behavior of its constituent materials when there are out-of-plane stresses without having to introduce additional degrees of freedom. The proposed FE is compared with the standard FE, presenting different kinematics, and excellent results are obtained. This work emerges from the need to combine and improve existing technologies in the field of finite-element analysis. One such technology is the numerical simulation of the behavior of composite materials. Therefore, it was also necessary to develop a computing program capable of reading both finite-element meshes and patterns of fibers to calculate the information of the composite materials, such as volumetric participation and fiber's orientation. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Damage assessment using modeling of large-scale confined masonry building,2018,Composite materials; Laminated element; Large reinforced concrete (RC) structures; Masonry structures; Mexican building code,Codes (symbols); Composite materials; Damage detection; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Earthquakes; Laminated composites; Reinforced concrete; Capacity spectrum method; Computational requirements; Constituent materials; Finite element meshes; Laminated element; Layered finite elements; Masonry structures; Structural drawings; Buildings; algorithm; building code; composite; earthquake damage; finite element method; masonry; multistorey building; regulatory framework; seismic response; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico City; Mexico [North America],0,0
12746,"A development of the ‘first-order storey pseudo-stiffness-based damage index’ of high-rise buildings is presented in this article. The proposed damage index is based on identification of an input set of one modal eigenpair, consisting of one modal frequency and the corresponding mode shape, overcoming the need and the difficulties of identifying multiple sets of eigenpairs in operational modal analyses of multistorey buildings. The calculation of first-order storey pseudo-stiffness-based damage index is expressed as a simple numerical procedure for comparison between the dynamic parameters of undamaged and damaged structures. The accuracy of the proposed damage assessment approach has been verified in two different tests - numerical and experimental. The numerical tests are based on the calculation of first-order storey pseudo-stiffness-based damage index in numerical models in which the structural damage is simulated with previously defined storey stiffness degradation. The experimental test consists of first-order storey pseudo-stiffness-based damage index accuracy test on the structure of the Urban Disaster Prevention Research Center, located in Tsukuba, Japan, and comparison to the results obtained by previously proven accurate damage detection method. The test results have shown that the proposed first-order storey pseudo-stiffness-based damage index index, based on the first modal eigenpair, can be applied as an instant damage detection method in structural health monitoring of multistorey buildings, providing the location and severity of structural damage. © The Author(s) 2016.",Damage evaluation in high-rise buildings using one modal eigenpair,2016,Damage detection; Damage index; Eigenpair; Modal frequency; Mode shape; Operational modal analysis; Pseudo-stiffness; Structural health monitoring,Disaster prevention; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Modal analysis; Office buildings; Stiffness; Structural analysis; Structural health monitoring; Tall buildings; Testing; Damage index; Eigenpairs; Modal frequency; Mode shapes; Operational modal analysis; Damage detection,0,0
12747,"Inelastic seismic responses of flexibly supported reinforced concrete (RC) moment-resisting frames representing short-to-tall structures stiffened with ductile RC structural walls were evaluated considering both far-field and near-field ground motions. A dual shear wall-frame resisting system with symmetric reference plan was created by adding shear walls into excitation direction of the three-dimensional frames developed by generic structure algorithm. The current study also aims to take into account soil-structure interaction effects in to damage assessment of multi-story RC buildings in terms of ductility demand, damage index, story shear force and overturning moment, as well as kinetic energy profile over the structure height. In doing so, the developed set of generic frames was considered accounting for different values of story strength, stiffness distribution and number of stories. A realistic modeling of nonlinear ductile behavior of RC elements was developed in combination with the sub-structuring method to consider the foundation flexibility in nonlinear seismic responses. Conducting a parametric study through nonlinear static analyses (pushover) as well as nonlinear response history analyses, the results indicated that the near-field ground motion presents much more damage than the far-field one. Inelastic dynamic responses to near-field records demonstrated that structures with a fundamental period greater than the pulse period respond differently from those that have shorter periods. The results were also presented as charts and tables that provide helpful information for engineering design purposes such as damage assessment of multi-story RC buildings with specific fundamental natural period and base shear strength. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Damage Index Distributions in RC Dual Lateral Load-Resistant Multi-Story Buildings Considering SSI Effects under Bidirectional Earthquakes,2018,damage index; ductility; Foundation flexibility; near-field ground motions; pushover; sub-structuring method,ductility; earthquake damage; foundation; genetic algorithm; ground motion; kinetic energy; reinforced concrete; seismic hazard; seismic response; shear strength; soil-structure interaction; stiffness,0,0
12749,"The use of energy dissipation devices as an earthquake resistant system is an increasing area of practical application worldwide. They are used as seismic protection systems in order to enhance structural performance by increasing inherent damping, raising safety, controlling deformations and balancing asymmetric conditions among others, thus reducing ideally the overall damage potential of the structures. Few codes have been developed for the analysis and design of these structures and the existing ones are still evolving. A key parameter that requires special attention is the added damping - reduced shear base design relationship due to, in a philosophical sense, seismic protected structures should assure the assumed performance enhancement. A comprehensive study of the added damping - structural strength relationship is conducted through three stages. The first stage is focused on nonlinear single degree of freedom systems, the second is extended to nonlinear 2-DOF systems in order to consider the torsional condition, and lastly a real eight story frame is analyzed. Structural performance is estimated via fragility curves constructed through the Incremental Dynamic Analysis. Damage is estimated through the Park and Ang index which is composed of two main parameters, the first related to damage caused by ductility demand, the second related to structural hysteretic dissipated energy. An ensemble of 42 Chilean accelerograms recorded at the M-w 8.8 2010 Maule Earthquake scaled to fifteen increasing intensities is considered. An optimal plan and height distribution of damping capacities is considered for the 2-DOF system and the eight story frame respectively. The Simplified Sequential Search Algorithm is the optimization technique implemented. Besides fragility curves, an added damping - strength capacity chart is presented as a decision-making tool. Structural strength reductions should be carefully considered in order to assure an effective damage potential reduction, especially when dealing with asymmetric structures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

12750,"Engineering practice shows that rock is commonly loaded cyclically during construction. Acoustic emissions (AEs) are still not effective for use as damage assessment precursors for rocks under cyclic loading-unloading. To explore more accurate damage precursors based on multiple AE indices, uniaxial loading-unloading tests were carried out on granite and marble specimens. The results show that at low stress levels, there are almost no AEs generated in the unloading stage but at higher stress levels, there are numerous AE events in the unloading part of the cycle. In each loading-unloading test, the AE count rate, R-AE, of each cycle shows a steadily increasing trend as the test progresses but the rate increases sharply in the last cycle. During the entire loading-unloading series, the AEs exhibited Kaiser effect and Felicity effects and the Felicity ratio, R-F, decreases as the cycle number increases. In addition, during rock deformation and failure, the R-F variations can be divided into three phases: Phase I, R-F > 1; Phase II, 0.6 < R-F <= 1; Phase III, R-F <= 0.6. The AEs do not show fractal characteristics during the first and second cycles but fractal features begin to appear in the third cycle. The correlation dimension, D, declines rapidly after the third cycle and then continues to decline slightly until the specimen ruptures. Combinations of R-AE, R-F and D can be used as signals for rock failure warnings and these combined indices can increase the accuracy of rock dynamic disaster predictions, especially for rocks under loading-unloading cycles. The research findings reported here should provide a more efficient method for issuing early warnings for dynamic rock disasters and provide guidance for the development of warning strategies.

12751,"In this paper, a ductile damage constitutive model was used to describe the damage evolution of material While a structure is subjected to earthquake loading. And embedding this constitutive model into UMAT subroutine using software ABAQUS to introduce damage constitutive equations. A damage index which includes both maximum and cumulative deformations was then used to estimate the different degrees of damage of structural members caused by cyclic loading. The collapse mechanism of single-layer reticulated shell was investigated through incremental dynamic analysis (IDA). Two types of collapse, dynamic instability and dynamic strength failure, were obtained. It was found that material damage accumulation had little effect on plastic development and collapse pattern when the structure was in dynamic instability; but the effect of material damage accumulation was obvious and could not be ignored when the structure was in dynamic strength failure due to large plastic development. Last, two different structural damage models one including multiple structural responses and the other including deformation and energy are defined based on limit state criteria. It was found through comparison of results that these two structural damage models can be used to accurately define and quantify different damage degrees of single-layer reticulated shells during earthquake. The vulnerability at different damage degrees of structure using the structural damage model was conducted through IDA analysis, which could be used for seismic performance evaluation and risk assessment.","Damage quantification, damage limit state criteria and vulnerability analysis for single-layer reticulated shell",2017,Reticulated shell; Damage accumulation; Damage index; Incremental dynamic analysis; Structural damage model,REINFORCED-CONCRETE FRAMES; POSTEARTHQUAKE EMERGENCY ASSESSMENT; CYCLE BENDING-FATIGUE; SEISMIC DAMAGE; RANDOM-EXCITATION; BUILDING DAMAGE; STEEL BARS; MODEL; EARTHQUAKE; USABILITY,0,0
12752,"Elevated water tanks are inverted pendulum type structures where drift limit is an important criterion for seismic design and performance evaluation. Explicit drift criteria for elevated water tanks are not available in the literature. In this study, probabilistic approach is used to determine maximum drift limit for damage state of yielding and damage state of collapse for the elevated water tanks supported on RC frame staging. The two damage states are defined using results of incremental dynamic analysis wherein a total of 2160 nonlinear time history analyses are performed using twelve artificial spectrum compatible ground motions. Analytical fragility curves are developed using two-parameter lognormal distribution. The maximum allowable drifts corresponding to yield and collapse level requirements are estimated for different tank capacities. Finally, a single fragility curve is developed which provides maximum drift values for the different probability of damage. Further, for rational consideration of the uncertainties in design, three confidence levels are selected and corresponding drift limits for damage states of yielding and collapse are proposed. These values of maximum drift can be used in performance-based seismic design for a particular damage state depending on the level of confidence.",Damage states of yielding and collapse for elevated water tanks supported on RC frame staging,2018,incremental dynamic analysis; fragility analysis; elevated water tanks; drift limits; frame staging,SOIL-STRUCTURE INTERACTION; LIQUID STORAGE TANKS; REINFORCED-CONCRETE PEDESTAL; RESPONSE MODIFICATION FACTOR; SEISMIC FRAGILITY ANALYSIS; NATURAL PERIOD; HIGHRISE BUILDINGS; DYNAMIC-BEHAVIOR; EARTHQUAKE; PERFORMANCE,0,0
12754,"Due to the casualties and economic losses that can be caused by building collapse after an earthquake, building damage assessment is a very important part of earthquake disaster evaluation. As a result of the advantages of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) imaging, both the accuracy and speed of the damage assessment can be guaranteed in the process of building damage identification using a single post-earthquake PolSAR image. The number of collapsed buildings is usually overestimated when adopting the traditional method, which is because the scattering mechanism is similar to that of intact oriented buildings. In view of this, the variable coefficient of angle domains based on the Fourier amplitude spectrum parameter (CV_AFI) is proposed to ameliorate the damaged building overestimation. By combining the improved Yamaguchi four-component decomposition method with the CV_AFI parameter, the proposed method can be used to extract building damage information from a single PolSAR image. With the Ms 7.1 Yushu earthquake in China as the research case, compared with the traditional method, the producer's accuracy of the proposed method for undamaged buildings was increased by 38.87%. The proposed method can obtain a higher accuracy of building damage information extraction and significantly reduce building damage overestimation.",Damaged building extraction from post-earthquake PolSAR data based on the Fourier transform,2021,None,None,0,0
12755,"A methodology for the automated identification of building damage from post-disaster aerial images was developed based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and building damage inventories. The aerial images and the building damage data obtained in the 2016 Kumamoto, and the 1995 Kobe, Japan earthquakes were analyzed. Since the roofs of many moderately damaged houses are covered with blue tarps immediately after disasters, not only collapsed and non-collapsed buildings but also the buildings covered with blue tarps were identified by the proposed method. The CNN architecture developed in this study correctly classifies the building damage with the accuracy of approximately 95 % in both earthquake data. We applied the developed CNN model to aerial images in Chiba, Japan, damaged by the typhoon in September 2019. The result shows that more than 90 % of the building damage are correctly classified by the CNN model.","Deep Learning-Based Identification of Collapsed, Non-Collapsed and Blue Tarp-Covered Buildings from Post-Disaster Aerial Images",2020,deep learning; building damage; aerial image; earthquake; typhoon,DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; EARTHQUAKE,0,0
12756,"The opportunity to locate and quantify the major criticalities associated to natural catastrophic events on a territory allows to plan adequate strategies and interventions by civil protection bodies involved in local and international emergencies. Seismic risk depends, most of all, on the vulnerability of buildings belonging to the urban areas. For this reason, the definition, by a deep analysis of the territory, of instruments identifying and locating vulnerability, largely favours the activities of institutions appointed to safeguard the safety of citizens. This paper proposes a procedure for the definition of vulnerability maps in terms of vulnerability indexes and critical peak ground accelerations for mid-small urban centres belonging to Mediterranean areas. The procedure, tested on the city centre of the Island of Lampedusa, is based on a preliminary historical investigation of the urban area and of the main formal and technological features of buildings involved. Moreover, the vulnerability of the constructions is evaluated by fast assessment methods (filling of evaluation forms). The vulnerability model, allowing the definition of the fragility curves, is calibrated on the basis of the results of an identification process of prototype buildings, selected to be adequately representative. Their characterizations have been provided using the results of an experimental dynamic investigation to develop high representative numerical model. Critical PGA values have been determined by pushover analyses. The results presented provided an unambiguous representation of the major criticalities with respect to seismic vulnerability and risk, of the city centre of the island, being a suitable tool for planning and handling of emergencies. © Asteris et al.; License Bentham Open.",Definition of seismic vulnerability maps for civil protection systems: The case of lampedusa Island,2016,Masonry; PGA; Pushover; Seismic risk; Vulnerability assessment,Criticality (nuclear fission); Seismology; Urban planning; Identification process; Masonry; Peak ground acceleration; Pushover; Seismic risk; Seismic vulnerability; Technological feature; Vulnerability assessments; Risk assessment,0,0
12757,"This paper presents panel-developed, expert opinion-based suggestions, and a Delphi process for the development of an earthquake damage assessment and recovery model. The model was specifically designed for the disaster relief of the damaged bridges of the 921 earthquake in Taiwan and uses four major indices: emergency handling ability, administrative capability, budget execution responsibility, and law enforcement reliability. The 921 earthquake, which occurred on September 21, 1999, forced the Taiwanese government into an unprecedented relief operation consisting of emergency rescue and reconstruction. However, some of the relief measures reflected possible inefficiency in intergovernmental cooperation. Regarded as one of the most decisive relief measures in Taichung County before it was consolidated and upgraded to a municipality on 25 December, 2010, the rescue and reconstruction of the majorly damaged bridges in the county were taken as an example to analyze the differences in the earthquake relief policies between the central and local governments. Based on experts' experiences in government affairs and the four major indices of the damage assessment and recovery model, the ongoing governmental restructuring policy is considered retrospectively not only at the central government level but also at the local government level; this would serve to improve preparedness for catastrophes and to solve possible problems in earthquake-related intergovernmental cooperation.",Delphi process applied to the 921 earthquake relief for damaged bridges in Taiwan,2017,921 earthquake; Bridge reconstruction; Delphi process; Government administration; Major index,BUILDINGS; SYSTEMS,0,0
12759,"In recent years there has been an increasing interest from governmental authorities and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in the seismic safety enhancement of school buildings in developing countries. Schools represent a reference point for local communities and can be used as primary facilities for emergency and recovery activities after an earthquake. Focusing on the Nepal case, the last 2015 seismic events have shown that Nepalese school buildings are characterized by a high level of vulnerability. According to post-disaster surveys, more than the 20 percent of the country's classrooms experienced damage or collapse during the earthquake. Nepal's building stock is mainly constituted by non-engineered constructions realized without seismic detailing and material quality controls. Particularly, unreinforced masonry (URM) structures, representing the majority of the total building inventory, are characterized by numerous construction deficiencies such as inadequate wall-to-wall or wall-to-floor connections which have led to frequent out-of-plane collapses. Herein, a spectral-based methodology to derive fragility curves for Nepalese unreinforced masonry school buildings subjected to out-of-plane damage is discussed. The technique is applied to the case of typical mud-mortar URM Nepalese structures, by taking into account regional variations in construction practice, material properties and recurrent failure modes detected after the 2015 seismic events. © 13th International Conference on Applications of Statistics and Probability in Civil Engineering, ICASP 2019.

12762,"Albay has zero casualty goals on every disaster that comes its way. Along with this, it is important that elementary schools, especially those schools that served as evacuation centers, receive and act upon the timely delivery of a warning system and make their school buildings as safe as possible. The main objective of the study was to design and develop the rapid damage assessment system for public elementary school buildings of Albay, Philippines. Specifically, it achieved the following: (1) identify the current procedures in conducting rapid damage assessment in public elementary school buildings of Albay; (2) determine the design features of the proposed rapid damage assessment system; and (3) generate appropriate report formats to represent the rapid damage assessment information. Rational Unified Process methodology phases and disciplines were used to design and develop the proposed system. Data were gathered through key informant interview and document analysis that covers Albay Province with four school divisions and 602 public elementary schools. The study is an efficient rapid damage assessment tool capable of processing and extracting information from the database and locates the public elementary school buildings of Albay through geographical information system support. It gathers information on school building damages, saves and views the data in real time, generates a report from the data collected, and provides quick and accurate information to the Department of Education officials to enable them to determine the type and extent of damages to the school building. Findings show that this new technique of assessing school damages is fast and efficient. The main advantage is the quickness and automation of the procedure.

12763,"Oblique aerial images provide a more comprehensive view for the geometric and texture information of both rooftop and facade of buildings, hence it is possible to precisely detect damage grading of building for a detailed and overall damage assessment after a disaster event. The detection of damaged to building facades can improve the accuracy of damage-type classification to support reconstruction after disaster events, especially in the case of moderate damaged buildings. In this paper, a novel approach for automatic detection of damaged facade based on local symmetry feature and the Gini Index using oblique aerial images is presented. First, facade is extracted from oblique images using three-dimensional texture mapping. Then, local symmetry points are detected in a sliding window, and we obtain the histogram bins of local symmetry points from vertical and horizontal direction. Finally, damaged and nondamaged of building facade are distinguished using Gini Index.

12764,"Change detection between images is a procedure used in many applications of remote sensing data. Among these applications, the identification of damaged infrastructures in urban areas due to a large-scale disaster is a task that is crucial for distributing relief, quantifying losses, and rescue purposes. A crucial consideration for change detection is that the images must be co-registered precisely to avoid errors resulting from misalignments. An essential consideration is that some large-magnitude earthquakes produce very complex distortions of the ground surface; therefore, a pair of images recorded before and after a particular earthquake cannot be co-registered accurately. In this study, we intend to identify changes between images that are not co-registered. The proposed procedure is based on the use of phase correlation, which shows different patterns in changed and non-changed areas. A careful study of the properties of phase correlation suggests that it is robust against misalignments between images. However, previous studies showed that, in areas with no-changes, the signal power in the phase correlation is not concentrated in a single component, but rather in several components. Thus, we study the performance of the l(1)-regularized logistic regression classifier to identify the relevant components of phase correlation and learn to detect non-changed and changes areas. An empirical evaluation consisting of identifying the changes between pre-event and post-event images corresponding to the 2018 Sulawesi Indonesia earthquake-tsunami was performed for this purpose. Pairs of visible and near-infrared (VNIR) spectral bands of medium-resolution were used to compute the phase correlation to set feature space. The phase correlation-based feature space consisted of 484 features. We evaluate the proposed procedure using a damage inventory performed from visual inspection of optical images of 0.5-m resolution. A third-party provided the referred inventory. Because of the limitation of medium-resolution imagery, the different damage levels in the damage inventory were merged into a binary class: changed and non-changed. The results demonstrate that the proposed procedure efficiently reproduced 85 +/- 6% of the damage inventory. Furthermore, our results identified tsunami-affected areas that were not previously identified by visual inspection.",Detecting urban changes using phase correlation and l(1)-based sparse model for early disaster response: A case study of the 2018 Sulawesi Indonesia earthquake-tsunami,2020,Building damage; Phase correlation; Sparse logistic regression; The 2018 Sulawesi Indonesia earthquake-tsunami,COLLAPSED BUILDINGS; IMAGE REGISTRATION; KUMAMOTO EARTHQUAKE; DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; LIDAR DATA; SATELLITE; INFORMATION; DISPLACEMENT; EXTRACTION; SUPERSHEAR,0,0
12766,"This study presents an application of the innovative fragility method proposed in companion paper (Part I) to a horizontal heat exchanger in Darlington nuclear generating station. To illustrate the advantages of the proposed method, seismic fragility curves and High Confidence of Low Probability of Failure seismic capacity of the heat exchanger are calculated by the conventional and proposed fragility methods. The results show that, by using two ground motion parameters, the median seismic capacity of the heat exchanger has remarkable 53.9% increase, and the High Confidence of Low Probability of Failure seismic capacity is increased by 25.0%. These increases come from the reduction of conservatism of the median seismic demand by incorporating the correlation between two ground motion parameters. Although applications of components mounted on supporting structures are not presented, seismic capacities of components are expected to increase as long as the effect of structural dominant modes on seismic responses are captured by employing the proposed method.

The present study aimed to develop a dynamic agent-based simulation model in post-earthquake USAR operations using geospatial information system and multi agent systems (GIS and MASs, respectively). We also propose an approach for dynamic task allocation and establishing collaboration among agents based on contract net protocol (CNP) and interval-based Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods, which consider uncertainty in natural hazards information during agents' decision-making. The decision-making weights were calculated by analytic hierarchy process (AHP). In order to implement the system, earthquake environment was simulated and the damage of the buildings and a number of injuries were calculated in Tehran's District 3: 23%, 37%, 24% and 16% of buildings were in slight, moderate, extensive and completely vulnerable classes, respectively. The number of injured persons was calculated to be 17,238. Numerical results in 27 scenarios showed that the proposed method is more accurate than the CNP method in the terms of USAR operational time (at least 13% decrease) and the number of human fatalities (at least 9% decrease). In interval uncertainty analysis of our proposed simulated system, the lower and upper bounds of uncertain responses are evaluated.

12774,"Since the two devastating tsunamis in 2004 (Indian Ocean) and 2011 (Great East Japan), new findings have emerged on the relationship between tsunami characteristics and damage in terms of fragility functions. Human loss and damage to buildings and infrastructures are the primary target of recovery and reconstruction; thus, such relationships for offshore properties and marine ecosystems remain unclear. To overcome this lack of knowledge, this study used the available data from two possible target areas (Mangokuura Lake and Matsushima Bay) from the 2011 Japan tsunami. This study has three main components: (1) reproduction of the 2011 tsunami, (2) damage investigation, and (3) fragility function development. First, the source models of the 2011 tsunami were verified and adjusted to reproduce the tsunami characteristics in the target areas. Second, the damage ratio (complete damage) of the aquaculture raft and eelgrass was investigated using satellite images taken before and after the 2011 tsunami through visual inspection and binarization. Third, the tsunami fragility functions were developed using the relationship between the simulated tsunami characteristics and the estimated damage ratio. Based on the statistical analysis results, fragility functions were developed for Mangokuura Lake, and the flow velocity was the main contributor to the damage instead of the wave amplitude. For example, the damage ratio above 0.9 was found to be equal to the maximum flow velocities of 1.3 m s-1 (aquaculture raft) and 3.0 m s-1 (eelgrass). This finding is consistent with the previously proposed damage criterion of 1 m s-1 for the aquaculture raft. This study is the first step in the development of damage assessment and planning for marine products and environmental factors to mitigate the effects of future tsunamis. © 2018 Biological Society of Washington.

12778,"Rapid and profound changes in the technology used for data acquisition, computing and information management provides a framework that has the potential to allow communities to consider acquiring, analyzing and managing data in new ways. Improving the collection and management of data, immediately in post-disaster reconnaissance and in long-term impact assessments, is central to enabling knowledge of such events to be used and applied to improving community resilience to those disasters. This paper presents the development and applications of an integrated and extensible framework for the capture of attribute data that describes pre-disaster physical characteristics and post-disaster damage of assets within our communities. The framework, referred to as Real-time Individual Asset Attribute Collection Tool (RiACT) and its associated Asset Repository Web Portal, enables data capture by direct field observations of asset attributes. It also includes the real-time transfer of these field observations to the web portal and/or the download of previously acquired history and metadata of any specific asset of interest to the observer whilst they are in the field. The use of this framework enables improved understanding of asset portfolios within the context of risk reduction and readiness, as well as facilitating efficient and rapid capture of damage distribution across the affected region. This in turn supports better decision making for a quicker disaster response and recovery. This paper presents a review of the existing state-of-art data collection methodologies and describe the development of an improved tool and its Information Technology architecture. Experiences and challenges in applying the framework are highlighted through: (1) the capture of community data in Viet Nam for a multi-hazard assessment in 2014 and 2018, the refinement of asset data related to residential buildings in the Greater Wellington region in 2016, and a survey of building types in Tanna, Vanuatu in 2018; (2) facilitating training in field data capture processes in Indonesia in 2015, as well as in Samoa and Vanuatu in 2017; (3) collection of asset damage data following the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake in New Zealand, the 2016 Tropical Cyclone Winston in Fiji and the 2015 Illapel earthquake and tsunami in Chile. © 2019 Lin, King, Horspool, Sadashiva, Paulik and Williams.",Development and application of the real-time individual asset attribute collection tool,2019,Damage assessment; Exposure dataset; Field data collection; Inventory repository; Post-disaster reconnaissance; Survey attributes,None,0,0
12779,"Flood loss models are one important source of uncertainty in flood risk assessments. Many countries experience sparseness or absence of comprehensive high-quality flood loss data, which is often rooted in a lack of protocols and reference procedures for compiling loss datasets after flood events. Such data are an important reference for developing and validating flood loss models. We consider the Secchia River flood event of January 2014, when a sudden levee breach caused the inundation of nearly 52 km2 in northern Italy. After this event local authorities collected a comprehensive flood loss dataset of affected private households including building footprints and structures and damages to buildings and contents. The dataset was enriched with further information compiled by us, including economic building values, maximum water depths, velocities and flood durations for each building. By analyzing this dataset we tackle the problem of flood damage estimation in Emilia-Romagna (Italy) by identifying empirical uni- and multivariable loss models for residential buildings and contents. The accuracy of the proposed models is compared with that of several flood damage models reported in the literature, providing additional insights into the transferability of the models among different contexts. Our results show that (1) even simple univariable damage models based on local data are significantly more accurate than literature models derived for different contexts; (2) multivariable models that consider several explanatory variables outperform univariable models, which use only water depth. However, multivariable models can only be effectively developed and applied if sufficient and detailed information is available. © Author(s) 2018.",Development and assessment of uni- and multivariable flood loss models for Emilia-Romagna (Italy),2018,None,accuracy assessment; data set; flood damage; levee; modeling; risk assessment; uncertainty analysis; Emilia-Romagna; Italy; Emilia,0,0
12780,"Commercial building flood losses significantly affect the Australian economy; however, there are not many models for commercial flood damage estimation and their results are not reliable. This study has attempted to derive and develop a new model (FLFA(CS)) for estimating the magnitude of direct damage on commercial structures. The FLFA(CS) - Flood Loss Function for Australian commercial structures, was calibrated using empirical data collected from the 2013 flood in Bundaberg, Australia, and considering the inherent uncertainty in the data sample. In addition, the newly derived model has been validated using a K-fold cross-validation procedure. The model performance has also been compared with the Flood Loss Estimation MOdel for the commercial sector (FLEMOCS) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) damage functions from overseas, as well as the ANUFLOOD damage model from Australia. The validation procedure shows very good results for FLFA(CS), performance (no bias and only five per cent mean absolute error). It also shows that ANUFLOOD, as Australia's most prevalently used commercial loss estimation model, is still subject to very high uncertainty. Hence, there is an immediate need for a project to build new depth damage functions for commercial and industrial properties. Awareness of these issues is important for strategic decision-making in flood risk reduction and it could amplify the cognition of decision-makers and insurance companies about flood risk assessment in Australia.

12782,"This paper deals with the development of nonlinear static models for the calculation of capacity curves that are subsequently applied in a scenario-based assessment of school buildings. The investigated building types include unreinforced masonry buildings with rigid floors and reinforced concrete buildings with slender shear walls, both of which are typical in central Europe. The curves were established by means of simplified mechanics-based models of the structures together with the expected failure mechanisms of the structural members, from which bilinear capacity curves were calculated. These capacity curves were used to derive fragility curves for a number of predefined earthquake scenarios in Basel, Switzerland. This application revealed that with the initial capacity curves developed in this project, the damage in the earthquake scenarios was largely overestimated compared to that predicted from empirical intensity-based vulnerability models. The initial curves had been determined with models that made use of code recommendations for the assessment of existing structures together with experimental mean material characteristics. Modifications to the modelling procedure, including revised assumptions concerning the failure modes and changes to the assumed initial stiffness based on vibration measurements, led to revised curves which featured, in particular, increased ductility. With these updated and validated capacity curves, results closer to the empirical intensity-based models were obtained. While the type of modelling used herein has its limitations due to simplicity, it was still possible to account for the influence of typical characteristics (such as the detailing of RC walls) on the relative behaviour and response of the buildings, thus justifying the use of analytical capacity and fragility functions, as opposed to empirical intensity-based models, in the final risk assessment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Development and validation of simplified mechanics-based capacity curves for scenario-based risk assessment of school buildings in Basel,2020,Capacity curves; Displacement-based evaluation; Fragility curves; Mechanical method; Seismic vulnerability assessment,Concrete buildings; Earthquakes; Reinforced concrete; Risk assessment; Risk perception; School buildings; Walls (structural partitions); Capacity curves; Displacement-Based; Fragility curves; Mechanical methods; Seismic vulnerability; Failure (mechanical); earthquake damage; failure mechanism; floor; masonry; reinforced concrete; risk assessment; stiffness; structural response; Basel; Basel-Stadt; Switzerland,0,0
12783,"Extending the application of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite materials into the automotive, aerospace and military manufacturing is a significant advance in recent years. However, few extending have been achieved in civil infrastructure and building construction industry. This gap is partly due to (i) the lack of multiphysics and multiscale models unifying degradation-deformation damage phenomena to assess the safety and durability of newly adopted or proposed material and structural systems, and (H) no available computational models that are succinctly fundamental and directly interactable with other digital files from architecture designer or manufacturer. To begin addressing this gap, this paper presents a structure level multiphysics model that uses the UV and moisture deterioration variables homogenized from a micromechanics model to integrate a nonlocal continuum damage model in a curvilinear coordinate system. This model links the application of analysis to the architecture or manufacturing digital model by enabling more accurate predictions of mechanical performance.

12784,"Nonintrusive damage assessment of concrete structures is evolving using newer technological interventions. Researchers are using different assessment techniques having their intrinsic limitations. A few are partially destructive, whereas others only provide qualitative information about the damages. Therefore, there is a need for a method using high-resolution imaging techniques for the assessment of exact damages and their depth along with intensity. Millimeter wave may be one of the good options for damage assessment. It is an efficient technique used in imaging applications due to its high resolution and effective penetration. Therefore, a novel millimeter wave assessment method is used in this study as a nondestructive post-fire damage test of concrete based civil engineering structures. An active millimeter wave radar system of 55-65 GHz has been used to measure the complex relative permittivity of concrete cube specimens for evaluation of damages caused by fire. In this study, fire damaged and control concrete cube specimens of 150 mm size were used for the measurement.

12785,"A collaborative effort was made within the scope of the EU project ITERATE to develop a web-based tool for large-scale probabilistic assessment intended to enable Algerian stakeholders to understand and calculate seismic risk though the convolution of hazard, exposure and vulnerability. A great amount of information was collected, organized and processed to determine the characteristics of the Northern Algerian built inventory (buildings and bridges) in terms of quantity, location, typology and structural behavior, using the city of Blida as pilot case-study. Furthermore, the vulnerability of the inventory was evaluated through the development of fragility curves, based on the observed behavior of a great number of nonlinear structural models under the effect of multiple earthquake records, accounting for epistemic and aleatory uncertainties. The developed exposure and vulnerability models, along with an updated seismic hazard model were loaded to a specifically developed web application which allows the probabilistic evaluation of seismic event scenarios, as well as automated predictions in terms of human and economic losses. © 13th International Conference on Applications of Statistics and Probability in Civil Engineering, ICASP 2019.

12786,"This work proposes a prescriptive methodology for the predesign in a simple manner timber structures up to 6 floors against seismic loads. The research is based on the analysis of structural models of archetypes oriented to social housing with eccentricity controlled by a suitable selection of strength and stiffness with respect to the structural axes. Through pseudo 3-D analysis of structural models of archetypes, and by identifying their dynamic behavior it is possible to define simplified models that allow the realization of parametric studies in relatively short time, which makes it attractive to use fragility curves for making decisions regarding design parameters. Response of models monitored in order to achieve structures with structural axes of variable resistance in height, in order to achieve optimal performance for various seismic records, so all resistant lines actively participate in the energy dissipation. The study's results ultimately suggest a proportional resistance for each level with respect to the first level response, which are proportional to the weight of the building. An important result of this work is that it is possible to suggest a simple way to design the system with seismic design coefficients, as an alternative to using the R-factor that reduces the elastic spectrum. The proposed methodology also incorporates control over the relative displacements between stories.

12787,"Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) is an engineered wood product with high rigidity, dimensional stability, and desirable environmental properties. Because of these characteristics, it presents the potential to resist the impact loads associated with windborne debris in both tornadoes and hurricanes. Full-scale experimental debris impact testing was performed on 3-layer CLT in order to determine its response to debris impact loading scenarios. A variety of missile masses, speeds, and impact locations were tested to determine this response. Various forms of failure were observed including missile perforation, excessive backside deflection, and dislodgement of debris on the backside of tested panels. Analysis of the experimental data was then performed with the goal producing a debris impact fragility curve for CLT. The resulting curves were based on relating a missile's kinetic energy with the probability of failure as defined by relevant testing standards. The results of this study point towards 3-ply CLT having a high likelihood of surviving impacts from EF-2 and EF-3 level missiles with a decreased likelihood of surviving debris from EF-4 and EF-5 level events.

12790,"This paper presents recent efforts in the development of risk-targeted ground motions for the Indonesian Earthquake Resistance Building Code SNI 1726-2012. Recently, in 2010, the Indonesian seismic hazard map was revised by our Indonesian Team from the 2002 map to a new hazard map. The revised map has adopted the most recent data and current state of knowledge in probabilistic and deterministic seismic hazard assessment methodologies, and through the use of the most recent ground motion predictive equations. So-called risk-targeted ground motions (RTGM) have also been developed. The risk-targeted ground motions for Indonesia are calculated as spectral response accelerations that result in 1% probability of building collapse in 50 years through a similar methodology as conducted by Luco et al. (2007). The authors do so by adopting generic fragility curves with alogarithmic standard deviation, β, value considered to be representative of Indonesian buildings.

12792,"In Japan, an evaluation of residual risk to events beyond the design basis is required for nuclear power plants (NPPs) and a probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) is considered as an effective measure to evaluate the residual risk. Meanwhile, for standardization in design of NPPs, a number of studies have been conducted on applying seismic isolation systems. In terms of residual risk of a seismically isolated NPP, application of a failsafe system is considered to enhance the redundancy and the robustness of the plant and also expected as a measure to reduce the risk. In this paper, firstly we proposed a fragility evaluation method for a seismically isolated building. We also calculated fragility curves. The result of the trial calculation showed that the failure in the seismic isolation layer was dominant. Then, focusing on events beyond the design basis, we examined some case studies on application of fail-safe systems to NPPs. Installing devices in seismically isolated layer to support the building as a part of the fail-safe systems, we tried to change the dominant failure mode in order to reduce the failure probability. Furthermore, we assumed some shock absorbers as additional fail-safe systems which could be expected to reduce the response of buildings when the building hit the retaining wall.",Development of evaluation method for seismic isolation systems of nuclear power facilities - Proposal of fragility evaluation method and study on application of fail-safe system,2017,None,Nuclear energy; Nuclear power plants; Outages; Risk assessment; Risks; Safety engineering; Seismic design; Seismology; Shock absorbers; Structural design; Effective measures; Fail safe systems; Failure Probability; Fragility curves; Isolated buildings; Probabilistic Risk Assessment; Seismic isolation; Seismic isolation systems; Nuclear fuels,0,0
12793,"Extended linear Drucker-Prager (DP) model has been a proper choice to capture the stress-strain of cylindrical concrete columns confined by fiber reinforced polymers (FRPs). However, most existing DP models calibrated by uniform active/passive tests are unsuitable for concrete under non-uniform passive confinement. This paper aims to calibrate the key parameters i.e., friction angle, plastic dilation angle and hardening needed for the DP model based on tri-axial test results on concrete cube subjected to non-uniform confinement. The effect of friction angle parameter is isolated from the hardening parameter within the yield function while the friction angle is defined as a function of concrete grade and hardening as a function of lateral confinement stiffness ratio. Here, the plastic lateral strains of non-uniform confined concrete, which could be obtained in cyclic tests but were usually left aside, are used to define a function for plastic dilation angle which works compatibly with the yield parameters. The resultant extended DP model could capture the stress-strain behaviour of concrete under both uniform or non-uniform passive pressure as well as the variable flow rules and different load paths occurring across the section of FRP-confined non-circular concrete.

This study aimed to analyze flood impact on residential areas and household damage, to develop a new, more accurate, method for flood damage assessment, considering different house types. To do this it was necessary to understand the vulnerability of different house types and household assets, and to develop flood damage functions which accounted for these variations. We considered the Bago River basin of Myanmar as a study area. A detailed household questionnaire survey was conducted to collect data. Using this data, new flood damage functions for residential buildings and assets for different types of house were developed by considering building characteristics such as construction materials, number of stories, and height of plinth level from the ground. The actual and potential flood damage data were combined to develop flood damage functions with improved accuracy for extreme floods. Then, flood damage to residential buildings and assets for recent floods were assessed by developing a grid-based approach, integrating hydrologic-hydraulic and flood loss estimation models. The reduction in expected annual damage by use of different flood adaptation options for residential buildings was also evaluated quantitatively. The results of this study show that elevating the plinth level of the building and adding an additional story to the house can significantly reduce the flood damage to residential buildings and assets, and these results provide useful information for establishing flood protection adaptation measures. © 2021 The Authors",Development of flood damage assessment method for residential areas considering various house types for Bago Region of Myanmar,2021,Adaptation measures; Damage functions; Flood impact; Residential areas; Risk reduction,None,0,0

According to bibliographical research, the industrial sector is often unprepared for these joint natural and technological or Natech events mainly because of the lack of guidelines on how to apply Natech regulations and the lack of information on the dynamics of Natechs. In order to fill the gaps and provide guidance on Natech risk assessment to operators, a systematic risk analysis methodology was developed and resulted firstly in proposing general reference bow-ties that reconfigure accidental scenarios triggered by flood events. The validation of these scenarios was made in the surface treatment sector.

The extreme damage that occurred during the 2016–2017 Central Italy seismic swarm highlighted once again the noteworthy seismic vulnerability of unreinforced masonry churches, which exhibited several collapses and caused uncountable losses to the Italian artistic heritage. The seismic performance of 158 affected buildings was analyzed in the aftermath of the main shocks. The failure modes activated by the earthquakes were identified making reference to the local mechanisms currently considered in Italy for post-seismic assessment of churches. The structural damage of the investigated buildings, related to 21 mechanisms rather than to an overall global response, was explained resorting to empirical statistical procedures taking into account ground motion intensity and structural details that can worsen or improve the seismic performance. Finally, parametric fragility curves were derived selecting those structural details that mostly influence the damage by means of the likelihood-ratio test.

12808,"Societal risks associated with debris flow hazards are significant and likely to escalate due to global population growth trends and the compounding effects of climate change. Quantitative risk assessment methods (QRA) provide a means of anticipating the likely impacts and consequences of settlement in areas susceptible to landslide activity and are increasingly being used to inform land use decisions that seek to increase disaster resilience through mitigation and/or adaptation. Current QRA methods for debris flow hazards are based primarily on empirical vulnerability functions that relate hazard intensity (depth, velocity, etc.) to expected levels of loss for a given asset of concern, i.e. most of current methods are dedicated to loss-intensity relations. Though grounded in observed cause-effect relationships, empirical vulnerability functions are not designed to predict the capacity of a building to withstand the physical impacts of a debris flow event, or the related uncertainties associated with modelling building performance as a function of variable debris flow parameters. This paper describes a methodology for developing functions that relate hazard intensity to probability of structural damage, i.e., fragility functions, rather than vulnerability functions, based on the combined hydrodynamic forces of a debris flow event (hazard level) and the inherent structural resistance of building typologies that are common in rural mountainous settings (building performance). Hazard level includes a hydrodynamic force variable (FDF), which accounts for the combined effects of debris flow depth and velocity, i.e. momentum flux (hv2), material density (ρ) and related flow characteristics including drag (Cd) and impact coefficient (Kd). Building performance is measured in terms of yield strength (Ay), ultimate lateral capacity (AU) and weight to breadth ratios (W/B) defined for a portfolio building types that are common in mountain settlements. Collectively, these model parameters are combined using probabilistic methods to produce building-specific fragility functions that describe the probability of reaching or exceeding successive thresholds of structural damage over a range of hazard intensity values, expressed in terms of momentum flux. Validation of the proposed fragility model is based on a comparison between model outputs and observed cause-effect relationships for recent debris flow events in South Korea and in Colombia. Debris flow impact momentum fluxes, capable of resulting in complete damage to unreinforced masonry buildings (URM) in those regions are estimated to be on the order of 24 m3/s2, consistent with field-based observations.

12810,"Passive control systems, such as buckling-restrained braces (BRBs), have emerged as efficient tools for seismic response control of new and existing structures by imparting strength and stiffness to buildings, while providing additional high and stable energy dissipation capacity. Systems equipped with BRBs have been widely investigated in literature; however, only a deterministic description of the BRBs’ properties is typically considered. These properties are provided by the manufacturer and are successively validated by qualification control tests according to code-based tolerance limits. Therefore, the device properties introduced within the structure could differ from their nominal design estimates, potentially leading to an undesired seismic performance. This study proposes a probabilistic assessment framework to evaluate the influence of BRBs’ uncertainty on the seismic response of a retrofitted RC frame. For the case study, a benchmark three-story RC moment-resisting frame is considered where BRBs’ uncertainty is defined compatible to the standardized tolerance limits of devices’ quality control tests. This uncertainty is implemented through a two-level factorial design strategy and Latin hypercube sampling technique. Cloud analysis and probabilistic seismic demand models are used to develop fragility functions for the bare and retrofitted frame for four damage states while also accounting for the uncertainty in the property of BRBs. Risk estimates are successively evaluated for three case study regions. The results show that, for the considered case study structure, these uncertainties could lead to an increase of fragility up to 21% and a variation in seismic risk estimates up to 56%. © 2021 The Authors.

12812,"Regional snowmelt flood disasters (RSFDs) can cause significant direct tangible damage which generally refers to the physical destruction due to direct contact with the flood water, such as damage to buildings, croplands, livestock, and infrastructure. Information about people, habitations, and infrastructure affected by the flood is essential for disaster responders and the humanitarian community to plan and coordinate emergency response activities. However, this direct tangible damage information obtained in the ground is limited, incomplete, contradictory, and sometimes impossible to obtain in a short time. Earth observation satellites help overcome operational uncertainties after the RSFDs.

A series of HJ-1 and GF-1 images were used to track the flood extent over the duration of the disaster, and the maximum affected flood area was assigned as the area in which direct tangible damage occurred. Pre-disaster GF-2 images were then used to estimate direct tangible damage to habitations (2375 households and 6388 rooms), infrastructure (102km of roads), and affected population (7125) in the flood area, which covered an area of 185,240m(2). Our method is an effective approach for the design of rescue plans and disaster subsidy programs.","Direct tangible damage assessment for regional snowmelt flood disasters with HJ-1 and HR satellite images: a case study of the Altay region, northern Xinjiang, China",2018,Snowmelt flood disaster; Tangible damage; HJ-1; GF-2; Remote sensing,OF-THE-ART; IMPACT ASSESSMENT; TIME-SERIES; WATER; MAP; SENSITIVITY; DYNAMICS; EXTENT; DELTA,0,0
12813,"Previous applications of machine learning in remote sensing for the identification of damaged buildings in the aftermath of a large-scale disaster have been successful. However, standard methods do not consider the complexity and costs of compiling a training data set after a large-scale disaster. In this article, we study disaster events in which the intensity can be modeled via numerical simulation and/or instrumentation. For such cases, two fully automatic procedures for the detection of severely damaged buildings are introduced. The fundamental assumption is that samples that are located in areas with low disaster intensity mainly represent nondamaged buildings. Furthermore, areas with moderate to strong disaster intensities likely contain damaged and nondamaged buildings. Under this assumption, a procedure that is based on the automatic selection of training samples for learning and calibrating the standard support vector machine classifier is utilized. The second procedure is based on the use of two regularization parameters to define the support vectors. These frameworks avoid the collection of labeled building samples via field surveys and/or visual inspection of optical images, which requires a significant amount of time. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated via application to three real cases: the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake-tsunami, the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, and the 2018 Okayama floods. The resulted accuracy ranges between 0.85 and 0.89, and thus, it shows that the result can be used for the rapid allocation of affected buildings.",Disaster Intensity-Based Selection of Training Samples for Remote Sensing Building Damage Classification,2021,Automatic labeling; building damage; multiregularization parameters; support vector machine (SVM),FRAGILITY CURVES; COLLAPSED BUILDINGS; EARTHQUAKE; SUPPORT; TSUNAMI; MODEL; SVM,0,0
12814,"We analyze the case of a building that collapsed in a multifamily complex of Tlalpan borough in Mexico City during the 19 September 2017 Central Mexico earthquake. Despite having similar materials and similar structural and geometric properties, this was the only building that collapsed in the complex. A structural analysis of the building and a study of the soils' predominant periods indicated that resonance effects, if any, would not be significant. However, phenomena related to the anomalous performance of buildings in dense urban areas such as geological soil, soil-structure interaction, and soil-city interaction effects were also investigated. A detailed analysis of the directionality of seismic actions recorded at nearby accel-erometric stations and of the azimuths of sound and damaged buildings indicates that directionality effects were responsible for the collapse of the building. Subsequently, a set of 58, two-component acceleration records of the earthquake was used to perform a thorough directionality analysis. The results were then compared with the foreseen uniform hazard response spectra and the design spectra in the city. Seismic actions in the city due to this earthquake were stronger than those corresponding to the uniform hazard response spectra. In addition, although design spectra have been significantly improved in the new 2017 Mexican seismic regulations, they were exceeded in 11 of 58 analyzed spectra. In 4 of these 11 cases, the design spectra were exceeded due to directionality effects. These results confirm the necessity of considering directionality effects in damage assessments, strong-motion prediction equations, and design regulations.",Do Directionality Effects Influence Expected Damage?

12815,"Masonry infills represent one of the prevailing types of non-structural elements in buildings of both Western and Eastern modern architecture. Recent seismic events have provided evidence that damage on masonry infills can lead not only to large economic losses but also to significant injuries and even fatalities. The estimation of damage of such elements and the corresponding consequences within the Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering (PBEE) framework, requires reliable fragility curves. Although there is an important body of work on testing masonry infills, there is very limited work that has led to the definition of fragility functions. This contribution presents drift-based fragility functions developed for in-plane loaded masonry infills, derived from a comprehensive experimental dataset gathered from current literature, comprising 152 specimens of infilled RC or steel frames tested under lateral cyclic loading, with different types of masonry blocks. Three key damage states associated with the structural performance and reparability of infill walls have been defined. In particular, four sources of uncertainty are evaluated: specimen-to-specimen, finite-sample, measured mortar compression strength and prism compression strength, presence of openings. The fragility curves developed in the present study are very useful for estimating damage and expected earthquake-induced economic losses for infilled buildings, by employing recently proposed methodologies based on aggregating the estimated damage at the component level for a specific structure.",Drift-based fragility assessment of masonry infills,2017,Fragility Functions; Infills; Masonry,Computational methods; Engineering geology; Geophysics; Losses; Masonry materials; Sampling; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Drift-based fragility; Fragility function; Infills; Masonry; Non-structural elements; Performance-based earthquake engineering; Sources of uncertainty; Structural performance; Earthquake engineering,0,0
12816,"It is undoubted how effective is the use of simulation for training and building situation awareness in a dynamic scenario evolution. When a disaster occurs, risk managers and emergency officials are required to know what critical infrastructure has been damaged and what the current disaster status is in order to direct assistance, supplies and resources accordingly. Drones, and UAVs in general, are able to carry out triage activities and disaster assessment ""from above"", thus representing a time- and life-saving resource. However, this implies pilots capable to accomplish tasks quickly and effectively so high quality training for the drone pilots on the ground is demanding more and more attention. The simulation-based training system proposed in this paper aims at pushing drones applications beyond the borders of Earth, thus supporting disaster relief operations within a moon base scenario. The Drones based RElief on Disaster Simulation (DREDIS) system, developed as integral part of the 2016 edition of SEE (Simulation Exploration Experience), is intended to demonstrate the powerful role of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as sophisticated measuring, area mapping, visual inspection, damage assessment and rescue supporting tool on a moon base scenario where every second in disaster relief operations counts more than in any other place. © 2016 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS).",Drones based relief on moon disaster simulation,2016,Disaster relief; Drones; Modeling & simulation; Simulation Exploration Experience,Damage detection; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Drones; Moon; Moon bases; Space research; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Damage assessments; Disaster relief; Disaster relief operations; Disaster simulation; Dynamic scenarios; Simulation Exploration Experience; Simulation-based training; Situation awareness; Emergency services,0,0
12817,"Dynamic problems analysis in the field of construction is necessary to guarantee the reliability of the structures in different applications, especially in case of structures subjected to seismic solicitations. In that context, the interest of this work is to study the effects of the composite materials used in the bracing concept for a building by using displacement dimensioning methods and establishing the “Pushover method” fragility curves. For this reason, a set of reinforced concrete buildings designed accordingly to the usual seismic practices, is used to study the influence of the bracing based on the innovative plates (FRP) compared to the one of the reinforced concrete sail which is based on the stability of the work during an earthquake. From one hand, the assumption of adherence is considered perfect between the FRP strips and the concrete, and on the other hand, between the reinforcements and the concrete, which makes it possible to analyze efficiently the behavior of the mechanical response of the proposed variants in this study. The aim is to improve the understanding of bracing in case of reinforced concrete construction in quasi-static (Pushover) and dynamic regimes. Several seismic numerical simulations based on the tool of massive finite elements have been conducted in order to identify the interest of different variants through the indicators’ evaluation of partial and total degradation of the superstructure. The study of the influence of each design variant on the stability of the construction has ultimately clarified the role of a new bracing proposal developed based on FRP materials.

12818,"The DIM2SEA research project aims to increase urban resilience to large-scale disasters. We are engaged in developing a prototype Dynamic Integrated Model for Disaster Management and Socioeconomic Analysis (DIM2SEA) that will give disaster officials, stake-holders, urban engineers and planners an analytic tool for mitigating some of the worst excesses of catastrophic events. This is achieved by harnessing state-of-the-art developments in damage assessment, spatial simulation modeling, and Geographic Information System (GIS). At the heart of DIM2SEA is an agent-based model combined with post-disaster damage assessment and socioeconomic impact models. The large amounts of simulated spatial and temporal data generated by the agent-based models are fused with the socioeconomic profiles of the target population to generate a multidimensional database of inherently “synthetic” big data. Progress in the following areas is reported here: (1) Synthetic population generation from census tract data into agent profiling and spatial allocation, (2) developing scenarios of building damage due to earthquakes and tsunamis, (3) building debris scattering estimation and road network disruption, (4) logistics regarding post-disaster relief distribution, (5) the labor market in post-disaster urban dynamics, and (6) household insurance behavior as a reflection of urban resilience. © 2018, Fuji Technology Press.

12819,"The development of collapse fragility curves is an essential requirement for the assessment of the collapse risk of structures. These fragility curves depend on the structural collapse capacity that is evaluated in terms of either the intensity measure (IM) or the damage measure (DM); such as the engineering demand parameter (EDP). In turn, collapse capacity estimates are sensitive to the method employed for their assessment. Conventionally, the IM and DM rules are employed in conjunction with incremental dynamic analyses (IDA) to quantify the collapse capacity of a structure. However, this approach has been criticised for being subjective in nature, since it depends on the structural response approaching predetermined threshold values. Therefore, it does not relate to the actual dynamic instability. Although the selection of these thresholds stems from the results of experimental investigations and equivalent numerical models and serve as an indirect check for dynamic instability, the present study seeks to provide a mathematical basis for defining collapse criteria. A dynamical system approach is used to formulate a mathematical criterion for defining P-Delta instability induced seismic collapse in single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) structures. The non-linear SDOF structure is considered as a non-autonomous, non-smooth system, and is studied as an ensemble of different sub-systems. Collapse is defined as the point when the dominant system eigenmode of the structure changes from stable to unstable, and remains unstable as the structure collapses. This approach can be applied to first mode governed multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) structures when studied as an equivalent SDOF structure. It is found that the dynamical systems approach results in higher deformations at collapse when compared to the conventional IM/DM rule based approach, suggesting the conservatism involved in the latter. However, it results in lower deformations at collapse when compared to the energy criterion, which relies on the occurrence of large deformations to predict collapse. Furthermore, the derived fragility curves show that the proposed approach yields lower probabilities of collapse when compared to the conventional method. Therefore, the proposed method can be used an alternative method for the performance design of structures.",Dynamical systems approach for the evaluation of seismic structural collapse and its integration into PBEE framework,2020,P-Delta instability; Dynamical systems; Dynamic stability; Performance-based earthquake engineering; Structural collapse; Collapse analysis,INSTABILITY; BUILDINGS; CAPACITY; DAMAGE,0,0

12821,"The casualties and economic loss related to private buildings due to the earthquake in Meinong District in Kaohsiung in 2016 reflected the importance of seismic retrofitting in such buildings. Under the restrictions of current rules, regulations, and systems, the government has promoted projects for the seismic assessment and retrofitting of structures in the hope of utilizing available resources to encourage people to conduct related evaluation and retrofitting. In 2017, an act to expedite the reconstruction of old and dangerous urban buildings passed all required legislative stages and came into effect, serving as a basis for rules, regulations, and systems related to the demolition and reconstruction of private buildings with structural hazards. However, no law for retrofitting private buildings with structural hazards has been drafted and related design practices and supportive mechanisms are scarce. Therefore, in order to explore the necessity and urgency of the relevant regulations and promotion strategies for seismic assessment and retrofitting of building, and to assist the establishment of the relevant regulations and the promotion mechanism of seismic retrofitting of private building, pushover analysis on buildings damaged by the 2016 Meinong earthquake was simulated using structural analysis software. Earthquake damage in metropolitan areas was assessed, and the input-output approach to cost-benefit analysis of seismic retrofitting was employed. In addition, analytical software was adopted to simulate cases of seismic retrofitting in buildings, with the Taiwan Earthquake Loss Estimation System developed by the National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering employed to conduct cost analysis on building retrofitting. The cost analysis results of two buildings in this study were compared to the actual costs incurred by building damage due to the earthquake to complete the cost-benefit analysis of the retrofitting projects.

12822,"Risk evaluation and loss analysis is key in foreseeing the impact of disasters caused by natural hazards and may contribute effectively in improving resilience in a community through the pre-evaluation of preparedness and mitigation actions. The pilot study presented herein is for the Chilean city of Iquique, which is located at the core of a seismic gap that extends from south Perú to north Chile, and has strategic geopolitical and economic importance for the country. The region was hit April 1, 2014, by an Mw 8.2 earthquake that caused only moderate damage, but seismological evidence suggests that there is still a potential for a much larger event in the region. Therefore, a careful damage assessment study is fundamental to anticipate the possible physical, social, and economic consequences that Iquique may face in the future. In this work, the HAZUS-MH platform was adapted and used to simulate a set of ten plausible physics-based future seismic scenarios with magnitudes ranging from Mw 8.40 to Mw 8.98, which were proposed based on an analysis of interplate locking and the residual slip potential remaining after the April 1, 2014, earthquake. Successful application of this damage assessment methodology relies on the construction of a comprehensive exposure model that takes into account regional features and a good characterization of the physical vulnerabilities. For Iquique, a large body of public and local data was used to develop a detailed inventory of physical and social assets including an aggregated building count, demographics, and essential facilities. To characterize the response of the built environment to seismic demand, appropriate HAZUS fragility curves were applied, and outcomes were validated against the damage observed in the 2014 earthquake. After satisfactory testing, a deterministic earthquake damage assessment study was carried out for the collection of predictive scenarios aimed to estimate their expected impacts. This analysis provides data for future evaluations of different physical and social mitigation measures for the city. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Earthquake damage assessment for deterministic scenarios in Iquique, Chile",2018,Damage assessment; Disaster risk reduction; HAZUS; Risk in Iquique; Scenario modeling,disaster management; earthquake damage; earthquake magnitude; modeling; risk assessment; scenario analysis; Chile; Iquique; Tarapaca,0,0
12823,"The post-earthquake damage assessment represents the first step after an emergency to support not only the safety of people, but also the preservation of buildings through the realization of prompt and effective provisional interventions. The issue is of particular relevance in case of monumental assets such as churches that are the focus of the paper. In Italy, since 1997 the post-earthquake damage assessment of churches has been carried out using a specific form, which was formally approved in 2001 by the Italian Civil Protection. Being the most advanced tool available in the literature within this specific field, the Italian form has been widely used also internationally. It follows the approach based on the decomposition of the church into macroelements. Although the latter has found wide confirmation through the interpretation of real damage, some critical issues were raised in relation to the versatility of the form and the reliability of the damage index that the approach provides. The post-earthquake damage assessment of 48 unreinforced masonry churches located in New Zealand, hit by the Canterbury earthquake sequence 2010–2011, represented an unprecedented opportunity, at international level, to investigate and to address the aforementioned issues. Starting from some weaknesses of the actual form, a new proposal (named CAF-D) for the damage assessment of unreinforced masonry churches has been developed and presented in the paper. The new form is still based on the macroelement approach, but it considers, in a separate way, the macroelements and the seismic damage modes they might develop, thus overcoming the limitation of the fixed number of damage mechanisms identified a priori by the current Italian form. The more reliable damage assessment approach that such form aims to achieve is the prelude to the development of a specific vulnerability model, derived by combining an empirical and an expert elicitation approach. A specific vulnerability model developed for New Zealand churches, derived by implementing the proposed CAF-D form and the related damage assessment procedure, is presented in the last part of the paper. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Earthquake damage assessment of masonry churches: proposal for rapid and detailed forms and derivation of empirical vulnerability curves,2019,Damage assessment form; Emergency management tool; Unreinforced masonry churches; Vulnerability curves,Earthquakes; Historic preservation; Masonry materials; Religious buildings; Risk management; Room and pillar mining; Structural analysis; Damage assessments; Earthquake sequences; Emergency management; Macro-element approaches; Preservation of buildings; Unreinforced masonry; Vulnerability curves; Vulnerability models; Damage detection; damage mechanics; earthquake damage; empirical analysis; masonry; monument; preservation; reinforced concrete; vulnerability; Canterbury [South Island]; New Zealand; South Island,0,0
12824,"Earthquakes have caused considerable structural damage globally in the past few decades. These incidents have demonstrated the severe and lasting effects of seismic activity on society and the economy. If an effective earthquake damage assessment system can be constructed, seismic disasters and damage can be estimated before an earthquake occurs. Relevant prevention and relief efforts can then be developed accordingly, including effective implementation of disaster prevention, disaster relief, accident handling, disaster investigation, and reconstruction. In addition, when an earthquake occurs, such a system can estimate, for example, the numbers of collapsed buildings and casualties, which will aid post-seismic emergency response and can be used to reduce seismic damage. This study has combined domestic and international disaster damage assessment models to estimate post-seismic damage using grid-based data and an earthquake damage estimation system. The simple interface and expandable framework of the system provide it with flexibility and convenience for future system extension.

Second, Byblos potable water network, seismicity, and geology are detailed. Third, the potable water network damage assessment methodology is presented.

Moreover, different Byblos geotechnical maps, landslide hazard, and liquefaction are investigated and embedded. Damage results to pipelines are dependent on the hazard maps obtained using different GMPEs and geotechnical maps.

12826,"Earth Observation (EO) data are used to map mostly affected urban areas after an earthquake generally exploiting change detection techniques applied at pixel scale. However, Civil Protection Services require damage assessment of each building according to a well-established scale to manage rescue operations and to estimate the economic losses. Considering the earthquake that hit L'Aquila city (Italy) on April 6, 2009, this work assess the feasibility of producing damage maps at the scale of single building from Very High Resolution (VHR) optical images collected before and after the seismic event. We considered the European Macroseismic Scale 1998 (EMS-98) and assessed the possibility to discriminate between collapsed or heavy damaged buildings (damage grade DG equal to 5 in the EMS-98 scale) and less damaged or undamaged buildings (DG < 5 in the EMS-98). The proposed approach relies on a pre-existing urban map to identify image objects corresponding to building footprints. The image analysis is carried out according to many different parameters with the objective of assessing their effectiveness in singling out changes associated to the building collapse. Features describing texture and colour changes, as well statistical similarity and correlation descriptors, such as the Kullbach Leibler Distance and the Mutual Information, were included in our analysis. Two supervised classification approaches, respectively, based on the use of the Bayesian Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) criterion and on Support Vector Machines (SVM), were compared. In our experiment, we considered the whole L'Aquila historical centre comparing classification results with the ground survey performed by the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV).

12827,"The Indo-Gangetic Foredeep region lies in close proximity to the Himalayan collision tectonics and the Peninsular Shield thereby subjecting it to repeated strong ground shaking from large and great earthquakes from these active tectonic regimes. An attempt is, therefore, made to understand the seismotectonic regime of the Indo-Gangetic Foredeep region while performing probabilistic seismic hazard modeling of its important cities of Patna and Lucknow and the religious city of Varanasi based on consideration of seismogenic source characteristics, smoothened gridded seismicity zoning, and generation of next generation ground motion attenuation models appropriate for this region along with other existing region-specific ground motion prediction equations in a logic tree framework. In the hazard modeling, peak ground acceleration (PGA) and 5% damped pseudo-spectral acceleration (PSA) at different time periods for 10 and 2% probability of exceedance in 50 years with a return period of 475 and 2475 years have been estimated at firm rock site condition (site class B/C) with an average shear-wave velocity of about 760 m/s, of which, however, the results of only 475 years of return period have been presented here for urban development and earthquake engineering point of view. Surface-consistent probabilistic seismic hazard is modeled using the International Building Code-compliant short and long period site factors corresponding to topographic gradient-derived shear-wave velocity-based site classes. The estimated surface-consistent PGA is seen to vary in the range of 0.222–0.238 g in Patna City, while it varies in the range 0.257–0.295 g in Lucknow and 0.146–0.172 g in the city of Varanasi. The cumulative damage probabilities in terms of ‘none,’ ‘slight,’ ‘moderate,’ ‘extensive,’ and ‘complete’ have been assessed using the capacity spectrum method in the Seismic Loss Estimation Approach (SELENA) using both the fragility and capacity functions for six model building types in these cities. The discrete damage probability exhibits that the building types ‘IGW-RCF2IL (PAGER/FEMA:C1L),’ ‘IGW-RCF21M (PAGER/FEMA:C1M),’ and ‘IGW-RCF11L (PAGER/FEMA:C3L)’ will suffer minimum damage, while ‘IGW-RCF21H (PAGER/FEMA:C1H),’ ‘IGW-RCF11M (PAGER/FEMA:C3M),’ and ‘PAGER/FEMA:C3H’ will suffer extensive damage in the event of a maximum earthquake of Mw 7.2 impacting the terrain as predicted from median nodal maximum magnitudes in a heuristic search in the probabilistic protocol. The estimated probabilistic seismic hazard and damage scenario are expected to play vital roles in the earthquake-inflicted disaster mitigation and management of these cities for better predisaster prevention, preparedness, and postdisaster rescue, relief, and rehabilitation. The results may also be incorporated in the building codal provisions of these smart cities as intended by the Federal Government of India. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Earthquake hazard potential of Indo-Gangetic Foredeep: its seismotectonism, hazard, and damage modeling for the cities of Patna, Lucknow, and Varanasi",2019,GMPEs; Indo-Gangetic Foredeep; Probabilistic seismic hazard; SELENA; Site condition; Structural damage,earthquake damage; ground motion; numerical model; probability; seismic hazard; seismicity; seismotectonics; structural analysis; Bihar; India; Patna,0,0
12828,"In recent years, there is an increasing need to quantify earthquake-induced losses throughout the expected life of a building in order to evaluate alternative design options and to minimize repairs in the aftermath of an earthquake. For this reason, the next generation of performance-based earthquake engineering evaluation procedures has formalized procedures that assess several metrics of seismic performance including economic losses. This paper discusses an analytical study that quantifies the expected earthquake-induced losses in typical office steel buildings designed with perimeter special moment frames or perimeter concentrically braced frames at various ground motion intensities. These buildings are designed in urban California in accordance with today's seismic design provisions in North America. The expected economic losses associated with repair are computed based on a refined performance-based earthquake engineering framework developed within the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research (PEER) center. This framework integrates site-specific seismic hazard, state-of-the-art nonlinear models that incorporate complex deteriorating phenomena of the structural components of a steel frame building, fragility curves of structural and non-structural components that express the probability of being or exceeding a specific damage level, and the resulting repair costs. The effect of residual deformations along the height of steel frame buildings on their earthquake losses is also examined. It is shown that repair costs in the aftermath of earthquakes vary significantly depending on the employed lateral load resisting system, as well as the analytical model representation of the steel frame building itself.",Earthquake loss assessment of steel frame buildings designed in highly seismic regions,2015,Collapse; Loss assessment; Losses due to demolition; Special concentrically braced frames; Steel special moment frames,Architectural design; Computational methods; Engineering geology; Losses; Repair; Seismic design; Steel construction; Structural dynamics; Structural frames; Collapse; Concentrically braced frames; Ground motion intensities; Lateral load resisting systems; Pacific earthquake engineering researches; Performance-based earthquake engineering; Special concentrically braced frames; Special moment frames; Earthquakes,0,0

According to the Spanish Seismic Code, the basic peak ground acceleration for a 475-year return period is 0.04 g, which corresponds to an intensity of VI. Thus, the expected physical damage is quantified and its impact on population and other quantities, such as debris and economic cost, are studied.

12832,"This paper presents a framework combining theoretical, numerical, and experimental approaches for evaluating the remaining-life of high-rise steel buildings based on earthquake-induced fatigue damage propagation in local beam-to-column connections. A mesh-independent finite element model is developed and implemented using the concept of lumped damage mechanics to estimate the fatigue-induced life loss associated with the extent of crack propagation until complete rupture failure occurred in beam-to-column connection substructure of high-rises. In this framework, a damage state variable is introduced at each end of beam elements and can be linked to the extension of the fatigue fracture in real frame building joints. Then, the damage evolution law is developed by extending the conventional Manson–Coffin law and a new crack-driving parameter to quantify the extent of damage states and predict the remaining life of the associated components in high-rises buildings. The proposed model is validated by a damage index measured from the local wireless sensors in substructure tests of ductile steel beam-to-column connections subjected to ultra-low cycle fatigue loadings.

Data were compiled from existing worldwide databases, and completed with earthquake information from regional studies. Economic data were converted to a single common currency unit (2015 USD value) and the wealth of the areas affected by 65 earthquakes of the region from 1900 to 2015 was assessed. Reduced-form models were used to determine economic and human losses, with earthquake magnitude and intensity as hazard-related variables, and gross domestic product of the affected area and the affected population as exposure-related variables. Damage to buildings was also used as a hazard-related variable to predict economic and human losses. Finally, site-specific regression models were proposed for economic and human losses due to earthquakes in the Mediterranean region, and more specifically, in Algeria. We show that by introducing the damage variable into the models, prediction error can be reduced, and that accuracy of loss model estimation is site dependent and requires regional data on earthquake losses to improve. A case study for Constantine, Algeria shows the improvements needed for increased accuracy. © 2017, The Author(s).","Economic and Human Loss Empirical Models for Earthquakes in the Mediterranean Region, with Particular Focus on Algeria",2017,Algeria; Earthquake loss estimation; Mediterranean region; Reduced-form models; Seismic intensity; Seismic magnitude,accuracy assessment; disaster management; earthquake damage; earthquake intensity; earthquake magnitude; economic impact; empirical analysis; Algeria; Constantine [Algeria]; Mediterranean Region,0,0

12835,"This study evaluates the effects of infills on the seismic resilience of special steel moment resisting frames. For this purpose, three structures of 4, 8 and 12 story are selected and designed in three different modes namely without infills, with Infills and with infills having openings. Finite element models are developed in OpenSees software. Seismic capacity and demand of structures are calculated using incremental dynamic analysis (IDA). Then, using statistical methods and probabilistic functions based on inter story drifts of the structures, fragility curves are obtained according to the HAZUS instructions. Finally, by quantifying damages, changes in seismic resilience are assessed. This makes it possible to relate the probability functions, fragility and resilience curves in an integrated approach. The results of the analysis show that infills may significantly reduce structural damages and an increase its resilience at different risk levels. The role of infills in increasing the resilience index is highlighted by the increase in risk level. This increase has been far more significant in low rise frames. It is also observed that the decreasing effect of infill openings in resilience index of high-rise buildings is less than low-rise ones although insignificant in some cases which can be overlooked. © 2021",Effect of infills on seismic resilience of special steel moment resisting frames,2021,Fragility curves; Incremental dynamic analysis; Masonry infill; Seismic resilience; Steel moment frame,None,0,0
12836,"Masonry infill walls significantly contribute to the seismic demand imposed on RC buildings. However, in general, infill walls are considered as nonstructural elements in seismic design and assessment of buildings and therefore potentially lead to inaccurate prediction of seismic performance of the buildings. The modeling of masonry infill walls is challenging, especially because they exert complex nonlinear material behavior and are subject to large variation in material properties. This study investigated the effect of infill-wall material type and modeling techniques on the seismic performance of RC frame buildings. The seismic performance of 3-, 6-, and 9-story RC buildings with calcarenite masonry, clay masonry, and lightweight concrete masonry were investigated. The infill wall was modeled using macromodeling approaches in which equivalent diagonal struts were used to simulate the infill-wall behavior. Nonlinear dynamic analysis of the buildings was carried out to develop the probabilistic seismic demand model (PSDM) using 30 ground motion records. Finally, fragility curves were developed for bare frames and infilled frames to quantify the effect of the variables investigated. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Effect of Infill-Wall Material Types and Modeling Techniques on the Seismic Response of Reinforced Concrete Buildings,2020,Macromodeling; Masonry infill wall; Probabilistic seismic demand model (PSDM); Reinforced concrete (RC),Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Infill drilling; Light weight concrete; Reinforced concrete; Seismic design; Seismic waves; Seismology; Concrete masonry; Equivalent diagonal struts; In-filled frames; Modeling technique; Non-structural elements; Nonlinear material behavior; Probabilistic seismic demand models; Seismic Performance; Walls (structural partitions); construction material; ground motion; infill; masonry; probability; reinforced concrete; seismic design; seismic response; three-dimensional modeling,0,0
12839,"Reinforced concrete frame (RCF) buildings are widely used around the world and they are present in most urban areas. This situation has occurred because they are cost-efficient, have good seismic performance and because the materials and technologies required for their construction are available in many countries. One of the decisions during the design stage of new buildings based on this structural system is selecting the type of partitions. So far, in most developing countries the use of masonry brick walls to separate habitational spaces is still the predominant choice for most new projects. This situation stems from the fact that the selection of partition elements is often motivated by architectural, economic and cultural reasons, and because there is lack of information about the potential impact of the weight of partition elements on the seismic performance. This paper presents the evaluation of the effect of the partition weight on the seismic performance of RCF buildings. For this purpose, a six-story building was designed considering three different types of partitions: a) drywall, b) expanded-reinforced polystyrene and c) traditional clay partitions. Each building design was modelled in three-dimensions using fiber elements and subjected to nonlinear analyses. Based on these results, fragility curves were calculated for different seismic performance levels. The results of these evaluations show that seismic performance improves when lighter partitions are used, particularly in the nonlinear range. These buildings showed higher performance at the life-safety and collapse levels. All things considered, the results of this research show that the weight of partitions has a notable impact in seismic performance, and it suggests that it should be given careful consideration to its choice during the design phase of a project, and that cities planners should promote the use of lightweight partitions for new buildings. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Effect of Partition Weight on the Seismic Performance of Reinforced Concrete Frame Buildings,2019,None,Architectural design; Developing countries; Seismic design; Seismic waves; Seismology; Urban planning; Lightweight partitions; Masonry brick walls; Materials and technologies; Potential impacts; Reinforced concrete frame buildings; Reinforced concrete frames; Seismic Performance; Structural systems; Reinforced concrete,0,0
12840,"Fragility curves are useful tools for evaluating the probability of structural damage due to earthquakes as a function of ground motion indices. The force reduction factor (R) is one of the seismic design parameters that determine the nonlinear performance of building structures during strong earthquakes. R factor itself is mostly a function of displacement ductility (mu), natural period of a structure, and soil conditions. A statistical method (Path Analysis) is proposed for the first time to determine the effect of R, mu and T on the column fragility curve parameters of typical box girder, two spans reinforced concrete highway bridge class. An analytical approach was adopted to develop the fragility curves based on numerical simulation. The R, mu and fundamental period T have been used to characterize different bridge configurations.

12841,"Structural characteristics, type of earthquake and geotechnical and geophysical attributes are important parameters while analysing the seismic performance of any structure. Thus, the present study thoroughly estimates the seismic vulnerability, which includes (i) extended finite fault modelling, for generating ground motion at bedrock level, (ii) multichannel analysis of surface wave (MASW) testing on soft soil site and 1-D ground response analysis to simulate amplification caused by soft soil site and (iii) nonlinear analysis of buildings. A four-storey reinforced concrete (RC) building with different arrangements of unreinforced masonry (URM) infill is considered, namely bare frame (BF), open ground storey (OGS), fully infill (FI) frame and partially infill (PI) frame. The finite element models of these frames are developed in opensees to study their nonlinear dynamic behaviour using synthetically generated ground motions. Finally, the fragility curves are generated for all four building frames. The results show that the median peak ground acceleration (PGA) value of the PI frame is almost two times the OGS frame for all damage states. Also, the BF, PI and FI frames designed using standard practices shows the performance level of collapse prevention, whereas the OGS shows a high damage probability of collapse under design-level earthquake. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Effect of site amplification on seismic fragility of RC building with different infill configurations using synthetic ground motions,2021,Reinforced concrete (RC); Seismic fragility; Synthetic ground motion; Unreinforced masonry (URM) infill,None,0,0
12842,"The seismic response of structures is very complex owing to the behaviour of soils during an earthquake. Traditional seismic designs rely on the assumption that the base of the foundation is fixed. However, the foundation tends to displace owing to the flexible nature of the soil. Indian seismic code and other codes though incorporate the effect of soil-structure-interaction (SSI), but in a very broad sense, and thus are inadequate. This study aims to understand the seismic performance of reinforced concrete (RC) framed buildings designed according to the Indian code, considering soil flexibility. The seismic vulnerability of buildings is investigated through pushover and fragility analysis. Six RC framed buildings with different heights, encompassing low-, mid- and high-rise buildings, covering a wide range of lateral periods (short-, medium- and long-periods), are considered. These buildings are considered to be resting on raft foundations. The soil flexibility for four types of soft clay soil is computed based on shear velocity, shear modulus and density. A variational study for a range of soft soils in combination with short-, medium- and long-period structures is carried out. Fragility curves and damage probability matrices are developed using push over analysis incorporating SSI. The overall conclusions from the fragility curves are that the soil flexibility may significantly increase the seismic vulnerability of low-rise RC framed buildings, and the performance of high-rise buildings may be improved by taking this into consideration. © 2019, © 2019 International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering (IABSE).",Effect of Soil Flexibility on Seismic Fragility of Code-Designed Reinforced Concrete Framed Buildings,2020,flexible base; fragility curve; reinforced concrete; seismic performance; seismic vulnerability,Clay; Earthquakes; Seismic design; Seismic waves; Shear flow; Soil structure interactions; Tall buildings; Damage probability matrices; Flexible base; Fragility curves; High rise building; Long-period structure; Push-over analysis; Seismic Performance; Seismic vulnerability; Reinforced concrete,0,0
12843,"In recent years, the nuclear industry and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) have made a tremendous effort to assess the safety of nuclear power plants as advances in seismology have led to the perception that the potential earthquake hazard in the United States may be higher than originally assumed. The Seismic Probabilistic Risk Assessment (S-PRA) is a systematic approach used in the nuclear power plants in the U.S. to realistically quantify the seismic risk as by performing an S-PRA, the dominant contributors to seismic risk and core damage can be identified. The assessment of component fragility is a crucial task in the S-PRA and because of the conservatism in the design process imposed by stringent codes and regulations for safety related structures, structures and safety related items are capable of withstanding earthquakes larger than the Safe Shutdown Earthquake (SSE). One major aspect of conservatism in the design is neglecting the effect of Soil-Structure-Interaction (SSI), from which conservative estimates of In-Structure Response Spectra (ISRS) are calculated resulting in conservative seismic demands for plant equipment. In this paper, a typical Reactor Building is chosen for a case study by discretizing the building into a lumped mass stick model (LMSM) taking into account model eccentricities and concrete cracking for higher demand. The model is first analyzed for a fixed base condition using the free field ground motion imposed at the foundation level from which ISRS are calculated at different elevations. Computations taking into account the SSI effects are then performed using the subtraction method accounting for inertial interactions by using frequency dependent foundation impedance functions depicting the flexibility of the foundation as well as the damping associated with foundation-soil interaction. Kinematic interactions are also taken into account in the SSI analysis by using frequency dependent transfer functions relating the free-field motion to the motion that would occur at the foundation level as the presence of foundation elements in soil causes foundation motions to deviate from free-field motions as a result of ground motion incoherence and foundation embedment. Comparing the results of the seismic response analyses, the effects of the SSI is quantified on the overall seismic risk and the SSI margin is calculated. A family of realistic seismic fragility curves of the structure are then developed using common industry safety factors (capacity, ductility, response, and strength factors), and also variability estimates for randomness and uncertainty. Realistic fragility estimates for structures directly enhances the component fragilities from which enhanced values of Core Damage Frequency (CDF) and Large Energy Release Frequency (LERF) are quantified as a final S-PRA deliverable.

12844,"Recently, the nuclear industry has made a tremendous effort to assess the safety of nuclear power plants (NPP), as advances in seismology have led to the perception that the potential earthquake hazard in the U.S. may be higher than originally assumed. Due to the conservatism in the NPP design, structures and safety-related items are capable of withstanding earthquakes larger than the safe shutdown earthquake (SSE). One major aspect of conservatism in the design is ignoring the effect of soil-structure interaction (SSI), which results in conservative estimates of seismic demands for plant equipment. In this paper, a typical reactor building (RB) is chosen for a case study to investigate the potential benefit of accounting for SSI effects. A lumped mass stick model is first developed and analyzed with a fixed base configuration, using the free-field ground motion as input at the foundation level, as well as with a SSI configuration. Fragility analyses are then performed for the RB and one of its components to quantify the effects of the SSI on the overall seismic risk. In each case, a family of seismic fragility curves is developed. It is found that consideration of SSI effects in the analysis can improve the component fragilities, and potentially enhance the core damage frequency (CDF) of the plant.

12845,"Post-earthquake recovery models can be used to quantify the resilience-related benefits of policies intended to mitigate building seismic risk. An assessment of the effect of the Los Angeles Soft-Story Ordinance on the post-earthquake housing recovery of residential communities is presented. An inventory of approximately 8000 buildings located in five Los Angeles neighborhoods is considered. The neighborhoods vary based on the percentage of soft-story buildings, population density and the fraction of renter- and owner-occupied residences. Archetype buildings that are representative of the target inventory are developed based on a building-by-building survey performed using Google Street View. Variations in the number of stories and presence and layout of the soft first story are considered in the development of the archetypes. Analytical building-level damage fragility curves are developed using the results from nonlinear analyses of structural models representing each archetype. A scenario-based damage assessment is performed using shaking intensities generated from the Southern California ShakeOut scenario, and a discrete-time state-based stochastic process model is used to represent post-earthquake recovery. The quantified effect of the Ordinance retrofit varied based on the considered recovery metric. For instance, the initial loss of occupancy for the entire inventory is reduced by 25%. However, if the time to restore 90% occupancy is used as the recovery performance metric, the Ordinance retrofit leads to a 64% reduction.",Effect of the Los Angeles Soft-Story Ordinance on the post-earthquake housing recovery of impacted residential communities,2019,Post-earthquake recovery; Seismic resilience; Los Angeles Soft-Story Ordinance; Earthquake policy evaluation; Seismic retrofit,EARTHQUAKE; NORTHRIDGE; BUILDINGS,0,0
12846,"The yielding mechanisms of reinforced concrete (RC) structures are the main cause of the collapse of RC buildings during earthquake excitation. Nowadays, the application of earthquake energy dissipation devices, such as viscous dampers (VDs), is being widely considered to protect RC structures which are designed to withstand severe seismic loads. However, the effect of VDs on the formation of plastic hinges and the yielding criteria of RC members has not been investigated extensively, due to the lack of an analytical model and a numerical means to evaluate the seismic response of structures. Therefore, this paper offers a comprehensive investigation of how damper devices influence the yielding mechanisms of RC buildings subjected to seismic excitation. For this purpose, adapting the Newmark method, a finite element algorithm was developed for the nonlinear dynamic analysis of reinforced concrete buildings equipped with VDs that are subjected to earthquake. A special finite element computer program was codified based on the developed algorithm. Finally, a parametric study was conducted for a three-story RC building equipped with supplementary VD devices, performing a nonlinear analysis in order to evaluate its effect on seismic damage and on the response of the structure. The results of this study showed that implementing VDs substantially changes the mechanism and formation of plastic hinges in RC buildings.",Effect of viscous dampers on yielding mechanisms of RC structures during earthquake,2015,earthquake; reinforce concrete; viscous damper; seismic damage; yield surface; finite element,REINFORCED-CONCRETE FRAMES; SOIL-STRUCTURE INTERACTION; MOMENT-RESISTING FRAME; SEISMIC PERFORMANCE; NONLINEAR-ANALYSIS; INELASTIC RESPONSE; DYNAMIC-ANALYSIS; DAMAGE MODEL; BEHAVIOR; DESIGN,0,0
12847,"The collapse of building structures during earthquakes has drawn much attention to the safety assessment and seismic design of structures to prevent their collapse. From the perspective of the energy flow during a dynamic event, an energy criterion for the dynamic instability of hardening structures under arbitrary excitations was previously developed. In this paper, the criterion is modified for the collapse identification of deteriorating structures, using an effective form of internal and external work applied to the structures. To account for the dynamic stability of a structural system at different damage stages, two time-varying energy indexes are introduced: one for the description of the structural properties, i.e., the effective intrinsic energy; and the other for the measurement of external work, i.e., the valid input energy. The first passage of the structural effective intrinsic energy over the valid input energy is shown to be an important indicator of the system instability that leads to the collapse of the structure. If the effective intrinsic energy is always less than the valid input energy during a dynamic process, the structure will survive. Collapse assessments are carried out with regard to the validity of the criterion as applied to three different deteriorating structures. The results show that the proposed criterion is able to depict the dynamic stability state and to predict the specific time of the collapse occurrence for deteriorating structural systems.

12848,"This paper explores the effectiveness and applicability of a newly developed thermo-mechanical coupled damage model for use in structural fire engineering. The damage-affected structural response of frame systems is accurately reproduced in this paper, which demonstrates the capability of the coupled damage model in giving a realistic representation of steel deterioration behaviour under combined actions of fire and mechanical loads. The coupled damage model is then used to assess the performance of a three-dimensional low-rise five-storey building and mid-rise ten-storey building with office occupancy under fire. Results provide a check of the office buildings for satisfying robustness requirements and give insight into the reasons that cause structural collapse. Compared to the conventional numerical approach, the consideration of coupled thermo-mechanical damage accumulation results in a substantial decrease in the time to collapse. A key finding from this study is that estimation of ultimate failure time by incorporating the coupled damage model with the recommended damage parameter sets has the potential to be utilized as a useful tool in helping designers to determine how much time is realistically available for evacuation before progressive collapse occurs in these types of buildings. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Effectiveness of coupled thermo-mechanical damage modelling in steel structural fire engineering,2021,None,Deterioration; Office buildings; Steel beams and girders; Coupled thermo-mechanical; Numerical approaches; Progressive collapse; Steel deterioration; Structural collapse; Structural fire engineering; Structural response; Thermo-mechanical coupled; Fires,0,0

12851,"Over the past six years, to increase the use of renewable materials in the construction industry, a novel steel-timber hybrid building system was developed and studied at the University of British Columbia and FPInnovations. The hybrid structural system was a steel moment resisting frames (SMRFs) with Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) infill walls.

The effect of CLT infills on the collapse risk of the SMRFs was not explicitly investigated, and is the topic of this paper. With consideration of seismicity of Vancouver (Canada)and using the 2010 National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) force based design guideline, 3- and 6-storey, 3-bay, bare and middle bay CLT-infilled SMRFs, were designed. Nonlinear analytical building models that account for the frame-infill interactions, were developed in the OpenSees finite element tool. L-shaped steel bracket connections were modeled using experimentally calibrated nonlinear two-node-link elements. Moreover, to allow brackets deformation, a small gap was provided at the interface of the steel frame members and CLT infill panels. To assess the collapse behavior and collapse fragility curves, incremental dynamic analysis was performed using 60 ground motion records selected with seismicity of Vancouver.

These are two-story residential houses built with an oriented strand board (OSB) wall system and stucco sheathing, an OSB wall system without stucco, and a horizontal board sheathing wall system without stucco. Three-dimensional numerical models of the structures were developed using the Timber3D program and calibrated with full-scale shake table test data. The shear wall systems were simulated with the modified Stewart (MSTEW) model that accounts for cyclic and in-cycle degradation. For this study, seven short duration ground motions from the China Lushan earthquake of 2013 and seven long duration motions from the adjacent 2008 Wenchuan earthquake were selected. Both suites of motions were recorded at the same strong motion stations and were spectrally matched to have similar spectra. Fragility curves for collapse and drift exceedance were derived based on incremental dynamic analysis (IDA). Results indicate that under long duration motions, median collapse capacities for the three houses are reduced by 26-61% compared to that due to short duration motions. A 1% lesser peak interstory drift (ISD) approaching collapse was also estimated under long duration motions. In addition, for a 3% design drift limit, there is a 17% higher probability of exceeding this drift due to long duration shaking. This study demonstrates that from the three types of houses analyzed in this study, house that had blocked shearwalls with OSB sheathing showed significantly higher seismic resistance than the other two housing types analyzed, while house that used horizontal wood boards showed the lowest resistance.

12854,"This study investigates the effects of ground-motion sequences on fragility and vulnerability of reinforced concrete (RC) moment-resisting frames (MRFs). Two four-storey, four-bay RC MRFs are selected as case studies. These structures, which share the same geometry, are representative of distinct vulnerability classes in the Mediterranean region and are characterized by different material properties, cross-section dimensions, and detailing. The first case study is a ductile MRF designed according to Eurocode 8 (i.e., a special-code frame), while the second is a non-ductile MRF designed to sustain only gravity loads (i.e., a pre-code frame). The influence of masonry infills on their seismic performance is also investigated. Advanced numerical models are developed to perform cloud-based sequential nonlinear time history analyses using ground-motion sequences assembled by randomly pairing two real records via Latin hypercube sampling. Different structure-specific damage states are considered to derive fragility curves for the undamaged structures, when subjected to a single ground-motion record, and state-dependent fragility curves by considering the additional damage induced by a second ground-motion record within the sequence. Damage-to-loss models are then used to derive mean vulnerability relationships. Results of the analysis show the importance of considering the effect of damage accumulation in the pre-code frames. Moreover, the presence of infills shows an overall positive contribution to the seismic performance of both frame types.

12855,"The seismic damage simulation of buildings has become a research focus because of the rapid urbanisation and the increase in the building density. However, there is no consensus regarding whether the spatial variability of ground motions at the local sites must be considered in collapse simulations. Thus, in the present study, a numerical model based on the finite element method that can effectively predict the collapse behaviour of reinforced concrete buildings is developed. Then, field ground motion records are selected from the measurement database. Finally, a building neighbourhood comprising four typical three-storey reinforced concrete frame structures is established as a numerical example, and the effects of the spatial variability and intensity of ground motions on the structural response and collapse behaviour of buildings are comprehensively investigated. The results indicate that the spatial variability of the ground motions significantly affects the structural responses and collapse behaviours of the buildings within a certain range of the ground motion intensity. The collapse behaviour of a single building exhibits significant differences with different ground motion intensities. These differences are attributed to the coupling of the nonlinearity of the structures and the randomness of the ground motions.

12856,"Seismic isolation is widely used around the world for the protection of buildings, but its long-term behaviour was not considered in detail in past seismic design of isolated structures. Nevertheless, the American seismic code has recently introduced an explicit procedure aimed at evaluating upper-bound and lower-bound values of isolation system properties. Yet there are few studies on the evolution and extent of the deterioration of elastomeric (e.g., high-damping rubber bearings) and sliding (e.g., flat sliding bearings) isolators during their lifetime and on their impact on the seismic behaviour of the superstructure. To investigate this problem, six-storey–reinforced concrete buildings, base isolated with high-damping rubber bearings acting alone or in combination with flat sliding bearings, are designed without considering the variability of mechanical properties of the isolation system due to ageing and air temperature. Then, based on experimental results from accelerated ageing tests at high temperature, mathematical models are implemented to account for oxidation of elastomers and friction changes. The variability of mechanical properties at different mean temperatures, due to seasonal thermal variations, is also considered. Finally, fragility curves are developed for the base-isolation system and superstructure on the basis of nonlinear dynamic analysis of the degraded test structures. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Effects of the long-term behaviour of isolation devices on the seismic response of base-isolated buildings,2019,ageing effects; air temperature effects; elastomeric bearings; fragility curves; nonlinear seismic analysis; sliding bearings,Atmospheric temperature; Bearings (structural); Concrete buildings; Damping; Deterioration; Mechanical properties; Nonmetallic bearings; Reinforced concrete; Rubber; Seismic response; Ageing effects; Air temperature; Elastomeric bearing; Fragility curves; Nonlinear seismic analysis; Sliding bearing; Seismic design,0,0
12857,"Probabilistic risk analysis is an effective tool for risk-informed decision-making related to the building facilities. All sources of the uncertainties should be considered in seismic risk assessment framework. Not only the levels of these uncertainties but also the effects on the performance of the buildings should be clearly identified. This paper aims to assess the impacts of the potential uncertainties on the seismic risk of steel frame equipped with steel panel wall (SPWF). Firstly, the performance limits of the SPWF structures are determined according to cyclic test results of two SPWF specimens. Then a validated numerical model of a 12-story SPWF building is modeled and used to perform the nonlinear time-history analysis, and the record-to-record uncertainty is identified by a set of ground motions derived from SAC project. Furthermore, comparisons are made on fragility curves for the building with or without considering the combining uncertainties in structural system, in defining performance limits and modeling technology. Finally, the annual probability and probability in 50years for each performance limit is calculated and compared. The impacts of such uncertainties on seismic risk of SPWF building are quantified for risk-informed evaluation of the SPWF buildings.",Effects of various uncertainties on seismic risk of steel frame equipped with steel panel wall,2018,Steel frame; Steel panel wall; Uncertainty; Seismic risk; Seismic fragility; Retrofit,PROBABILISTIC PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT; REINFORCED-CONCRETE FRAMES; SYSTEMS; REHABILITATION; BEHAVIOR,0,0

12859,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficiency of various structural modeling schemes for evaluating seismic performances and fragility of the reactor containment building (RCB) structure in the advanced power reactor 1400 (APR1400) nuclear power plant (NPP). Four structural modeling schemes, i.e. lumped-mass stick model (LMSM), solid-based finite element model (Solid FEM), multi-layer shell model (MLSM), and beam-truss model (BTM), are developed to simulate the seismic behaviors of the containment structure. A full three-dimensional finite element model (full 3D FEM) is additionally constructed to verify the previous numerical models. A set of input ground motions with response spectra matching to the US NRC 1.60 design spectrum is generated to perform linear and nonlinear time-history analyses. Floor response spectra (FRS) and floor displacements are obtained at the different elevations of the structure since they are critical outputs for evaluating the seismic vulnerability of RCB and secondary components. The results show that the difference in seismic responses between linear and nonlinear analyses gets larger as an earthquake intensity increases. It is observed that the linear analysis underestimates floor displacements while it overestimates floor accelerations. Moreover, a systematic assessment of the capability and efficiency of each structural model is presented thoroughly. MLSM can be an alternative approach to a full 3D FEM, which is complicated in modeling and extremely time-consuming in dynamic analyses. Specifically, BTM is recommended as the optimal model for evaluating the nonlinear seismic performance of NPP structures. Thereafter, linear and nonlinear BTM are employed in a series of time-history analyses to develop fragility curves of RCB for different damage states. It is shown that the linear analysis underestimates the probability of damage of RCB at a given earthquake intensity when compared to the nonlinear analysis. The nonlinear analysis approach is highly suggested for assessing the vulnerability of NPP structures. © 2021 Korean Nuclear Society",Efficiency of various structural modeling schemes on evaluating seismic performance and fragility of APR1400 containment building,2021,Beam-truss element model; Floor response spectrum; Multi-layer shell model; Reactor containment building; Time-history analysis,None,0,0
12860,"The implementation of a wireless smart sensor network (WSSN) to monitor a structure subjected to sudden events (e.g., earthquakes) poses many challenges. One typical challenge is to synchronize the data from different sensors during event-triggered sensing, because each wireless sensor has its own independent clock and their triggering time is generally different and unknowable. The challenge becomes more acute when real-time data acquisition is required to support vibration control or rapid damage assessment under sudden events. Although various strategies have been proposed to achieve synchronized sensing of WSSNs, all of these strategies fall short in addressing the challenges of sudden-event monitoring. In this paper, we first proposed an efficient two-stage time synchronization strategy for general structural health monitoring as a baseline and implemented it on a next-generation wireless smart sensor. Building upon the baseline method, efficient time synchronization strategies are proposed, which are fully autonomous and highly efficient for sudden-event monitoring. Two classes of events are considered: short-duration events, for example, bridge impacts, during which initial data loss issues are critical, and long-duration events, such as strong winds, which can benefit significantly from employing real-time monitoring. For short-duration events, a post-event time synchronization strategy is developed, which autonomously performs offline synchronization after measurement. For long-duration events, a real-time time synchronization strategy is proposed, which can support real-time applications under sudden events, for example, vibration control. These time synchronization strategies are experimentally validated to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy (under 20-μs maximum error) of the proposed sudden-event synchronized sensing strategies. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Efficient and high-precision time synchronization for wireless monitoring of civil infrastructure subjected to sudden events,2021,event-triggered sensing; structural health monitoring; sudden-event monitoring; time synchronization; wireless smart sensors,Damage detection; Data acquisition; Smart sensors; Structural health monitoring; Vibration control; Wireless sensor networks; Civil infrastructures; Long duration events; Real time data acquisition; Real time monitoring; Real-time application; Short duration events; Time synchronization; Wireless smart sensors; Synchronization,0,0
12861,"Knowing the response of buildings to earthquakes is very important in order to ensure that a structure is able to withstand a given level of ground shaking. Thus, nonlinear dynamic earthquake engineering analyses are unavoidable and are preferable procedure in the seismic assessment of buildings. In order to estimate seismic performance on the basis of the hazard at the site where the structure is located, the selection of appropriate seismic input is known to be a critical step while performing this kind of analysis. In this paper, seismic analysis is performed for a four-story reinforced concrete ISPRA frame structure which is designed according to Eurocode 8 (EC8). A total of 90 different earthquake scenarios were selected, 30 for each of three target spectrums, EC8 spectrum, Uniform Hazard Spectrum (UHS), and Conditional Mean Spectrum (CMS). The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the average maximum Inter-story Drift Ratio (IDR) for each target spectrum. Time history analysis for every earthquake record was obtained and, as a result, IDR as the main measure of damage were presented in order to compare with defined performance levels of reinforced concrete bare frames.",Efficient damage assessment for selected earthquake records based on spectral matching,2019,seismic damage assessment; target spectrum; earthquake records,None,0,0
12862,"Reinforced concrete (RC) structures are common in seismic zones. However, damage assessment after earthquake events can be problematic and subjective due to their highly nonlinear and time-varying behaviour when damaged. This research develops a hysteresis loop analysis (HLA)-based method for rapid structural health monitoring of an experimental, scaled 12-storey RC frame building subjected to two levels of input ground motions. A six equivalent degree-of-freedom (DOF) system model is proposed to represent the 12-storey test structure, where the accelerations of every two floors are recorded during earthquake excitations. Hysteresis loops are then reconstructed for each DOF using the calculated equivalent restoring force and divided into a number of half cycles in chronological order. Finally, changes in elastic storey stiffness used as a damage index are tracked over time for damage identification of each DOF based on the statistical analysis of the selected half cycles. The identification results clearly show that the proposed algorithm is capable of identifying damage that was not evident by external visual appearance, and also offers significant advantages in identifying the location and severity of damage over traditional methods for realistic RC structures immediately after an event. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Efficient hysteresis loop analysis-based damage identification of a reinforced concrete frame structure over multiple events,2017,Damage identification; Hysteresis loop analysis; Reinforced concrete structure; Seismic response; Shaking table test; Structural health monitoring,Concretes; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Earthquakes; Geophysics; Hysteresis; Hysteresis loops; Reinforced concrete; Seismic response; Seismology; Structural analysis; Structural health monitoring; Chronological order; Damage assessments; Damage Identification; Degree of freedom (dof); Earthquake events; Earthquake excitation; Reinforced concrete frame structures; Shaking table tests; Damage detection,0,0
12863,"In this paper, the properties of cement mortar with 0.5 W/C before and after freeze-thaw cycles in 4 wt% NaCl solution were measured. The experiments include mass loss, X-CT scanning and axial compression full curve. Results showed that cement mortar damage under freeze-thaw cycle was a layer-by-layer peeling process from exterior to interior. As the freeze-thaw cycles proceeded, the initial mass loss rate of mortar slowly increased and then the rate rapidly increased, and a mass loss prediction equation was proposed. Using X-ray CT scanning and 3D reconstruction technology, a method for the evaluation of the internal damage rule of cement mortar under freeze-thaw cycles was proposed. The porosity change of sample before and after freeze-thaw cycles was calculated by X-ray CT scanning technology. As the number of freeze-thaw cycles increased, the porosity increment of the samples increased approximately linearly. The peak compressive stress, initial elasticity modulus and residual strength of cement mortar caused by freeze-thaw cycles reduced gradually, and with the increase in cycling number, the downward trend became more obvious. Based on mass loss and the change of internal overall porosity of mortar, an elastic modulus damage model of cement mortar was established which is in good agreement with the experimental results.

12864,"Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme events and, consequently, flooding in urban and peri-urban areas. The electrical grid is exposed to an increase in fault probability because its infrastructure was designed considering historical frequencies of extreme events occurred in the past. In this respect, to ensure future energy plans and securing services is of great relevance to determine and evaluate the new zones that may be under risk and its relation to critical infrastructures for such extreme events. In this regard, the electrical distribution system is one of the key critical infrastructures since it feeds the others and with the future plans of zero-emissions (leading to the electrification of transport, buildings, renewable energies, etc.) will become even more important in the short term. In this paper, a novel methodology has been developed, able to analyze flood hazard maps quantifying the probability of failure risk of the electrical assets and their potential impacts using a probabilistic approach. Furthermore, a process to monetize the consequences of the yielded risk was established. The whole method developed was applied to the Barcelona and Bristol case study cities. In this way, two different examples of application have been undertaken by using slightly different inputs. Two main inputs were required: (1) the development of accurate GIS hazard flooding models; and (2) the location of the electrical assets (i.e., Distribution Centers (DCs). To assess and monetize the flood risk to DCs, a variety of variables and tools were required such as water depths (i.e., flood maps), DCs' areas of influence, fragility curves, and damage curves. The analysis was performed for different return periods under different scenarios, current (Baseline) and future (Business As Usual (BAU) rainfall conditions. The number of DCs affected was quantified and classified into different categories of risk, where up to 363 were affected in Barcelona and 623 in Bristol. Their risk monetization resulted in maximums of 815,700 € in Barcelona and 643,500 € in Bristol. Finally, the percentage of risk increases when considering future rainfall conditions (i.e., BAU) when calculated, resulting in a 2.38% increase in Barcelona and 3.37% increase in Bristol, which in monetary terms would be an average of a 22% increase. © 2020 by the authors.",Electrical grid risk assessment against flooding in Barcelona and Bristol cities,2020,City resiliency; Electrical distribution network; Flooding; GIS model; RESCCUE project; Risk Assessment,accuracy assessment; distribution system; electrification; extreme event; flood frequency; flooding; GIS; infrastructure; probability; rainfall; risk assessment; smart grid; water depth; Barcelona [Catalonia]; Bristol [Bristol (ADS)]; Bristol [England]; Catalonia; England; Spain; United Kingdom,0,0
12865,"Tornado-induced wind load modeling has advanced significantly in recent years, but comparison of the experimental or numerical models to observed tornado damage is limited. This paper describes the development of empirically derived tornado fragility functions for residential structures following the 22 May 2011 Joplin, Missouri tornado. The fragility functions were created by combining a residential structure damage assessment of the Joplin tornado using the enhanced Fujita (EF) scale and a tornado wind field model conditioned to tree-fall patterns. The damage states for the fragility functions used the degrees of damage (DOD) for one-and two-story residential structures from the EF scale. The empirical tornado fragility functions were compared to analytically derived fragility functions for straightline winds from the FEMA Hazus hurricane model to provide a first attempt at ascertaining how different or similar failure wind speeds are for residential structures under tornado-induced and straightline wind loads. Median failure wind speeds from the empirical tornado fragility functions increased monotonically with DOD, from 33.4 m/s for DOD1 to 85.6 m/s for DOD9. Median failure wind speeds of the empirical tornado fragility functions and Hazus hurricane straightline wind fragility functions differed by 5% or less when suburban terrain was assumed throughout the damage path, and 25% or less when open terrain was assumed. The results suggest that tornado load amplification factors are at worst no more than 55% for residential structures, and may be lower than 10%.

12866,"Earthquakes that have occurred in the last twenty years in the Mediterranean area have had significant economic and social impacts. Most of the economic losses of reinforced concrete (RC) frames was due to nonstructural component damage, particularly masonry infills and partitions. Therefore, the seismic behaviour of masonry infills should be reliably characterized. The main goals of this study for a more reliable loss estimation for infilled RC frames are: (i) the analysis of the inter-story drift ratio (IDR) capacity at given damage states (DSs) with the aim to define drift-based fragility functions and (ii) analyse direct losses due to infill damage following seismic events. First, a database of experimental tests performed on 1-bay, 1-story scaled RC frames infilled with clay bricks or concrete blocks is collected. Drift-based fragility curves are obtained, which depend on the infill brick materials and properties. Then, the drift capacity threshold at each DS is correlated to the in-plane response of the infill panel to directly quantify the relationship that exists among them. The influence of openings on drift capacities is also evaluated. Then, seismic losses related to infills are computed, providing expected monetary losses depending on the infill typology. The required reparation activities and their costs are also listed. The bearing of each activity and cost at each DS is explicitly evaluated. Additionally, loss functions that directly depend on IDR demand are provided, thus fusing together the damage analysis and loss analysis.

12868,"Recent earthquakes have exposed the vulnerability of existing buildings; this is demonstrated by damage incurred after moderate-to-high magnitude earthquakes. This stresses the need to exploit available data from different sources to develop reliable seismic risk components. As far as it regards empirical fragility assessment, accurate estimation of ground-shaking at the location of buildings of interest is as crucial as the accurate evaluation of observed damage for these buildings. This implies that explicit consideration of the uncertainties in the prediction of ground shaking leads to more robust empirical fragility curves. In such context, the simulation-based methods can be employed to provide fragility estimates that integrate over the space of plausible ground-shaking fields. These ground-shaking fields are generated according to the joint probability distribution of ground-shaking at the location of the buildings of interest considering the spatial correlation structure in the ground motion prediction residuals and updated based on the registered ground shaking data and observed damage. As an alternative to the embedded coefficients in the ground motion prediction equations accounting for subsoil categories, stratigraphic coefficients can be applied directly to the ground motion fields at the engineering bedrock level. Empirical fragility curves obtained using the observed damage in the aftermath of Amatrice Earthquake for residential masonry buildings show that explicit consideration of the uncertainty in the prediction of ground-shaking significantly affects the results. © 2020, The Author(s).",Empirical fragility assessment using conditional GMPE-based ground shaking fields: application to damage data for 2016 Amatrice Earthquake,2020,Ground motion prediction equations; Logistic regression; Masonry buildings; Predictive fragility; Seismic fragility assessment; Spatial correlation,Buildings; Damage detection; Equations of motion; Forecasting; Motion estimation; Probability distributions; Soils; Stratigraphy; Accurate estimation; Fragility assessment; Fragility curves; Ground motion prediction; Ground-motion prediction equations; Joint probability distributions; Simulation-based method; Spatial correlation structures; Earthquakes; bedrock; earthquake damage; earthquake event; empirical analysis; ground motion; masonry; residential development; shaking table test; Amatrice; Italy; Lazio; Rieti,0,0
12869,"Significant structural and non-structural damage suffered by residential buildings due to recent earthquakes world-wide provide a sad testimony to the vulnerability of the existing building stock. This evidence stresses the need to develop accurate seismic vulnerability assessment tools in the service of strategic planning and applicable at a territorial scale. The empirical fragility curves have been used quite often in order to characterize the vulnerability of prescribed buildings classes as opposed to individual buildings. In this approach, the fragility curve represents both the building-to-building variability within the class and the uncertainty in the building class response to future earthquakes. Development of empirical fragility curves for classes of buildings depends to a large extent on the pairs of seismic ground shaking intensity and observed damage data gathered from spatially distributed buildings. The seismic intensity experienced at the site of each building is usually estimated by employing maps of ground shaking for the earthquake of interest (a.k.a., shakeMaps). The accuracy in the estimation of the ground shaking intensity is arguably as important as that of the evaluation of the incurred damage. The former involves explicit characterization of the uncertainties in the ground-shaking intensity estimation. This can be achieved through application of ground motion prediction equations and the corresponding spatial correlation structure in the residuals (of the predictive equation), resulting in generation of random fields of ground shaking. Each field represents a plausible distribution of ground motion intensity for a given earthquake scenario. Then, the random ground shaking field can be updated based on available observations of ground shaking intensity from nearby stations. The generated random fields can be further modified to consider the local stratigraphic and topographic amplification. For a given damage pattern observed for a prescribed building class, the generation of random ground motion fields leads to a set of plausible empirical fragility curves (corresponding to exceedance of different damage states). The fragility curves and their 16th, 50th and 84th percentiles, obtained based on the generated random ground shaking fields and observed damage in the aftermath of Amatrice 2016 Earthquake (based on Copernicus EMS damage maps) show reasonable agreement with the empirical fragility curves available in the literature for similar buildings classes. © 2019 The authors.",Empirical fragility curves based on random ground shaking fields: Employing Copernicus-EMS damage grading maps for 2016 amatrice sequence,2019,Empirical fragility curves; Masonry buildings remote sensing; Visual survey; Vulnerability assessment,Buildings; Computational methods; Earthquake engineering; Engineering geology; Equations of motion; Grading; Motion estimation; Remote sensing; Stratigraphy; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Fragility curves; Ground motion intensities; Ground shaking intensity; Ground-motion prediction equations; Masonry building; Spatial correlation structures; Topographic amplification; Vulnerability assessments; Earthquakes,0,0
12879,"Non-linear dynamic analysis and the damage index of Park-Ang have been often used to assess expected seismic damage to a structure. Depending on the size of the structure and the duration of the record, the computational effort in dynamic analyses is usually high. In this research, a new damage index is proposed based on nonlinear static analysis. The damage index is a linear combination of two energy functions: (1) the strain energy associated with the stiffness variation and the ductility of the structure, and (2) the dissipated energy associated with hysteretic cycles. These two energy functions are obtained from the capacity curve of the structure and from the energy balance with the spectral acceleration. To show the ability of the index to represent damage, low-rise steel buildings were studied under the seismic actions that are expected in Mexico City. The results obtained with the new method show good agreement with those calculated by means of dynamic analyses using the Park-Ang damage index. On average, the Park-Ang damage index is well-fitted by the combination of 62% of the strain energy and 38% of the energy dissipated by hysteresis. Moreover, the new damage index can link damage to certain characteristics of seismic actions, such as their intensity and duration. Therefore, the new approach results in a practical, powerful tool for estimating seismic damage in buildings, especially as probabilistic approaches require massive computations.

12880,"Seismic vulnerability of historic churches is a well known issue in earthquake engineering. The need of preserving these buildings encourages the development of reliable numerical methods to assess their seismic behavior. In this paper a new approach is presented, based on evaluating damage pattern obtained by non-linear dynamic analysis and the energy dissipated by each macro-element during earthquakes. A hierarchy of dissipated energy'' concept emerges to give a scale of vulnerability of the parts that compose a church. By modifying masonry mechanical parameters or geometric features, the crack pattern and amount of energy dissipation density of each element is varied and calibrated to achieve the desired hierarchy. The structural designer can therefore estimate the effectiveness of strengthening devices by checking reduction and possibly migration of dissipated energy density from weaker structural elements to more resistant ones, together with a preferable damage pattern. The proposed strategy is applied to a single nave church, hit by the Emilia Romagna earthquake (Italy, 2012), first defining a scale of vulnerability of the macro-elements and then proposing a rehabilitation strategy, which improves the seismic response in terms of damages and dissipated energy. The strong vulnerability of the main dome vault is shown, due to the combination of its high dissipated energy density with its intrinsic weakness.

12881,"Conventional concrete frames are designed to dissipate the earthquake energy through inelastic deformation of the structural elements. It leads to hefty repairment costs and prolonged down time after earthquakes. Self-centering concrete frames (SCCF) have been introduced to minimize the unrecoverable structural damages and post-earthquake repairment costs. SCCF exhibits predictable yield mechanism and self-centering capacity. This paper presents an energy-based seismic design (EBSD) procedure for SCCFs. Based on a proposed damage model, hysteretic energy demand, E-H, is introduced as a key design parameter. The desired damage state and structural deformations can be considered in design process. EBSD allows designers to select various performance objectives at different seismic intensities. A prototype building is designed using the proposed EBSD procedure. The performance of SCCF designed using EBSD is compared with the same prototype structure designed using direct displacement-based design method (DDBD).

12883,"In this study, we developed an enhanced approach for large-scale flood damage and risk assessments that uses characteristics of buildings and the built environment as object-based information to represent exposure and vulnerability to flooding. Most current large-scale assessments use an aggregated land-use category to represent the exposure, treating all exposed elements the same. For large areas where previously only coarse information existed such as in Africa, more detailed exposure data are becoming available. For our approach, a direct relation between the construction type and building material of the exposed elements is used to develop vulnerability curves. We further present a method to differentiate flood risk in urban and rural areas based on characteristics of the built environment. We applied the model to Ethiopia and found that rural flood risk accounts for about 22% of simulated damage; rural damage is generally neglected in the typical land-use-based damage models, particularly at this scale.

12886,"Models for estimating flood losses to infrastructure are rare and their reliability is seldom investigated although infrastructure losses might contribute considerably to the overall flood losses. In this paper, an empirical modelling approach for estimating direct structural flood damage to railway infrastructure and associated financial losses is presented. Via a combination of event data, i.e. photo-documented damage on the Northern Railway in Lower Austria caused by the March River flood in 2006, and simulated flood characteristics, i.e. water levels, flow velocities and combinations thereof, the correlations between physical flood impact parameters and damage occurred to the railway track were investigated and subsequently rendered into a damage model. After calibrating the loss estimation using recorded repair costs of the Austrian Federal Railways, the model was applied to three synthetic scenarios with return periods of 30, 100 and 300 years of March River flooding. Finally, the model results are compared to depth-damage-curve-based approaches for the infrastructure sector obtained from the Rhine Atlas damage model and the Damage Scanner model. The results of this case study indicate a good performance of our two-stage model approach. However, due to a lack of independent event and damage data, the model could not yet be validated. Future research in natural risk should focus on the development of event and damage documentation procedures to overcome this significant hurdle in flood damage modelling.",Estimating flood damage to railway infrastructure - the case study of the March River flood in 2006 at the Austrian Northern Railway,2015,None,BUILDINGS,0,0
12887,"Modern seismic codes are based on capacity design and the hierarchy of strength philosophy that allows inelastic response in case of severe earthquakes. Thus, in most traditional systems, earthquake damage develops at well-defined locations in reinforced concrete (RC) structures.

There is a perceived strong demand from government and industry to develop techniques for assessing damage to steel reinforcement bars embedded in cracked structural concrete elements of earthquake-damaged buildings. Although some studies have been conducted recently, a validated methodology to quantify the level and extent of plastic deformation and residual strain capacity has yet to be widely accepted. In this paper, a damage assessment methodology is proposed based on empirical relationships between hardness versus strain and residual strain capacity that accounts for the effects of strain aging.

12888,"Insufficient information about the seismic performance of tunnel-form buildings and limited relevant design codes and standards are the main barriers towards application of these systems in seismically active areas. Vertical and horizontal irregularity of typical tunnel-form buildings is another cumbersome challenge restricting the application of these systems. To address these issues, this study aims to evaluate the seismic behaviour of tunnel-form buildings with horizontal irregularity and develop appropriate design methodologies. Based on the results of 3, 5, 7 and 10-storey buildings, new response modification factors are proposed as a function of seismic demand and expected performance level. Fragility curves are also derived for various levels of intensity, and simple equations are introduced to estimate uncoupled frequency ratios. The results, in general, demonstrate the flexible torsional behaviour of irregular tunnel-form structures and their adequate seismic resistance capacity. The buildings studied herein, managed to satisfy the immediate occupancy performance requirements under design-basis earthquake, which implies that the plan regularity requirement for tunnel-form buildings in seismic codes may be too conservative. Moreover, it is concluded that using response modification factor equal to 5 can generally result in sufficient stability and adequate performance level under both design basis and maximum considered earthquake scenarios. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Estimation of seismic response parameters and capacity of irregular tunnel-form buildings,2019,Fragility analysis; Irregularity; Response modification factor; Tunnel-form structural system; Uncoupled frequencies ratio,Architectural design; Earthquakes; Seismic design; Seismic response; Fragility analysis; Irregularity; Response modification factors; Structural systems; Uncoupled frequencies ratio; Tunnels; earthquake event; methodology; parameter estimation; seismic response; tunnel,0,0
12889,"The assessment of the vulnerability of buildings subjected to earthquake-induced liquefaction requires the definition of an integrated damage scale accounting both for ground motion damage and permanent ground movements. The latter can cause rigid-body settlements and tilt of the building, but also flexural demand on members due to the differential settlement of isolated shallow footings. The magnitude of those differential settlements should be estimated based on probabilistic approaches and appropriate modelling of the different sources of uncertainty associated to the phenomenon, especially in the case of liquefiable deposits. Nevertheless, most of the existing procedures to estimate differential settlements rely only on soil characteristics, thus neglecting the influence of the building stiffness on the soil-structure interaction. Such an assumption may result in code-conforming rigid reinforced concrete (RC) frames showing unrealistically high vulnerability. In the present work, representative values of the members’ initial flexural demand due to differential settlement are proposed based on simplified modelling of the soil and structure variability and on a preliminary assumption of seismic forces’ distribution. A simple procedure is developed that relies on the structure-to-soil stiffness ratio and the equivalent soil heterogeneity under shallow footings. The methodology is calibrated using parametric linear analyses for a set of planar RC frames, and the estimated member demand due to differential settlements is related to the expected demand due to the seismic action considering different intensities. Results show that, in most cases, the relevance of the potential increment of the initial member flexural demand due to differential settlements may not be very severe when compared to the seismic demand. As such, more simplified approaches could be considered for damage assessment of the combined effects, namely those where differential settlements are accounted for separate to the seismic and rigid-body demand. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Estimation of the potential relevance of differential settlements in earthquake-induced liquefaction damage assessment,2020,Differential settlement; Earthquake; Liquefaction; Soil-structure interaction; Stiffness,Damage detection; Liquefaction; Reinforced concrete; Rigid structures; Soil liquefaction; Soil structure interactions; Soils; Stiffness; Uncertainty analysis; Differential settlement; Permanent ground movements; Probabilistic approaches; Reinforced concrete frames; Representative values; Simplified modelling; Soil characteristics; Sources of uncertainty; Earthquakes; building; earthquake damage; estimation method; ground motion; ground settlement; induced seismicity; liquefaction; soil-structure interaction; stiffness,0,0

12892,"The current design approach recommended by seismic codes is often based on the use of uniform-hazard response spectra, reduced to account for inelastic structural behaviour. This approach has some strong limitations that have been highlighted in many studies, including not allowing a direct control of the seismic risk and losses. This study aims at quantifying the levels of safety and the costs associated with this design approach, and to investigate alternative design approaches that have been developed in the last decades. In particular, a risk-targeting approach and a minimum-cost approach are considered. The first one, allowed by US codes, aims at designing structures with the same risk of collapse throughout regions of different seismicity. The second one aims to minimize the sum of the initial construction cost and the cost of expected losses due to future earthquakes. The comparison of the three approaches is performed by considering, as an example structure, a four-storey reinforced concrete frame building located in different areas in Europe, and by looking at the implications in terms of achieved safety levels, initial costs, and future losses.

12893,"Few studies have investigated so far the collapse capacity of buildings with base-isolation. In such studies, preliminary considerations have been drawn based on a number of assumptions regarding: (i) the methodology used for assessing the collapse capacity, (ii) the collapse conditions and failure modes assumed for both superstructure and isolation system, and (iii) the numerical modeling assumptions. The main results pointed out that the collapse conditions of base-isolated buildings may occur for intensity levels slightly higher than those associated with the design earthquake. In this paper, further developments are made through the use of enhanced models for the description of the behavior of a rubber-based isolation system and the assumption of more rational collapse conditions. Collapse fragility functions, in terms of mean and dispersion values, are proposed for two archetypes representative of existing buildings retrofitted using the seismic isolation technique. The collapse margin ratio (median collapse capacity Sa, C, namely the spectral acceleration associated to a probability of exceedance equal to 50%, divided by the design spectral acceleration at the collapse prevention limit state) has been evaluated for each examined case-study.

12894,"The earthquake early warning (EEW)-research group at National Taiwan University has been developing a microelectromechanical system-based accelerometer called “P-Alert”, designed for issuing EEWs. The main advantage of P-Alert is that it is a relatively economical seismometer. However, because of the expensive nature of commercial hardware for structural health monitoring (SHM) systems, the application of SHM to buildings remains limited. To determine the performance of P-Alert for evaluating post-earthquake building safety, we conducted a series of steel-frame shaking table tests with incremental damage. We used the fragility curves of different damage levels and the interstory drift ratios (calculated by the measured acceleration of each story using double integration and a filter) to gauge the potential damage levels. We concluded that the acceptable detection of damage for an entire building is possible. With improvements to the synchronization of the P-Alert sensors, we also anticipate a damage localization feature for the stories of a building. © 2018 by the authors.

12895,"In flood risk management, the choice of vulnerability functions has a remarkable impact on the overall uncertainty of modelling flood damage. The spatial transferability of empirical vulnerability functions is limited, leading to the need for computation and validation of region-specific vulnerability functions. In data-scarce regions however, this option is not feasible. In contrast, the physical processes of flood impact model chains can be developed in these regions because of the availability of global datasets. Here we evaluated the implementation of a synthetic vulnerability function into a flood impact model. The function bases on expert heuristics on a targeted sample of representative buildings (targeted heuristics). We applied the vulnerability function in a meso-scale river basin and evaluated the new function by comparing the resulting flood damage with the damage computed by other approaches, (1) an ensemble of vulnerability functions available from the literature, (2) an individual vulnerability function calibrated with region-specific data, and (3) the vulnerability function used in flood risk management by the Swiss government.

12896,"How long can a seismically deficient building be used until the seismic risk becomes too high to be acceptable? A model interim use plan is developed with requirements to abandon the building if retrofit is not completed in the use period. Acceptable seismic performance is keyed to American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) 41 levels. The acceptable occupancy or use period is limited to that which results in the same probability of performance as stated for an ASCE 7-16–compliant building, except that the total risk in the use period is due to all possible earthquakes impacting the site, not just the maximum considered earthquake. The Thiel–Zsutty damage model is used to determine the probabilities for assigned threshold ranges where unacceptable performance can occur. Other response prediction models can be used if they provide an annual probability of a given performance level exceedance. Example applications are given for both marginally and highly deficient buildings located at 17 national sites in high and moderate seismic hazard regions and include ASCE 7 Risk Class I–IV buildings.

12898,"Rigid Wall Flexible roof Diaphragm (RWFD) buildings, commonly referred to as big-box buildings are the most prevalent type of construction for low-rise industrial and warehouse facilities in the United States (US). These buildings usually incorporate rigid-in plane concrete tilt-up walls and flexible wood roof diaphragms, which is a commonly seen construction technique in the Western United States. Due to their vulnerability in high seismic areas (e.g. California) observed in past earthquakes, an alternative design methodology was introduced in the FEMA P1026 document to account for the response of the flexible roof diaphragm. The FEMA P1026 design approach has been validated through numerical collapse assessment studies. In this study, the Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering framework, introduced by the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research (PEER) center, is combined with Monte Carlo Simulation to evaluate, in a probabilistic sense, the earthquake-induced economic losses for these structures. The results are presented in terms of expected losses for two hazard intensities: Maximum Considered Earthquake (MCE) and Design Earthquake (DE), while loss disaggregation plots for collapse and no collapse losses are also presented. The results demonstrate the ability of the FEMA P1026 design approach to reduce earthquake losses compared to current code-conforming RWFD buildings. Additionally, the results can provide damage and loss information for modeling of these types of buildings within a resilient community and other spatially focused analyses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

12899,"Confinement of reinforced concrete members has repeatedly proven crucial when structures are exposed to strong ground motions. Yet, unconfined concrete is still widely used in developing countries with significant seismic hazard. To quantify the effect of lack of confinement on collapse probability of reinforced concrete frames, incremental dynamic analyses were conducted on two 4-story reinforced concrete moment resisting frame buildings using 5 ground motions. The structures are identical and comply to Eurocode demands except for the fact that one is completely unconfined whereas the other is confined according to the code. The analyses were conducted in OpenSEES using Mander's material model for confined and unconfined concrete. Based on the results of the analyses, collapse fragility curves were created for each structure. The results show statistically significant effect of confinement on the collapse probability of the reinforced concrete frame. The prabability of collapse is 1.2 and 12 %, respectively, for the code complying and the unconfined structure exposed to a design level earthquake. © 2017 The Authors.

12900,"According to “The structural design manual of timber frame structure” of National institute of forest science, the number of wooden structure has been increasing since 2000. However, the scope of structure safety verification for wooden structures is defined as more than 3 stories or as more than 500m². So, wooden structure buildings that are mainly composed less than 2 stories are usually excluded the scope of structure safety verification. Therefore, a horizontal loading test is performed on the beam-column joint of timber frame structures that have been recently built.

12901,"Damage assessments after past earthquakes have frequently revealed that plan configuration irregular buildings have more severe damage due to excessive torsional responses and stress concentration than regular buildings. The plan configuration irregularities introduce major challenges in the seismic design of buildings. One such form of irregularity is the presence of re-entrant corners in the L-shaped buildings that causes stress concentration due to sudden changes in stiffness and torsional response amplification; hence causes early collapse. A constructive research into re-entrant corner and torsional irregularity problems is essentially needed greater than ever. Therefore, the focus of this study is to investigate structural seismic response demands for the class of L-shaped buildings through evaluating the plan configuration irregularity of re-entrant corners and lateral–torsion coupling effects on measured seismic response demands. The measured responses include story drift, inter-story drift, story shear force, overturning moment, torsion moment at the base and over building height, and torsional irregularity ratio. Three dimensional finite element model for nine stories symmetric buildings as reference model is developed. In addition, six L-shaped building models are formulated with gradual reduction in the plan of the reference building model. The results prove that building models with high irregularity are more vulnerable due to the stress concentration and lateral torsional coupling behavior than that with regular buildings. In addition, the related lateral shear forces in vertical resisting elements located on the periphery of the L-shaped buildings could be significantly increased in comparison with the corresponding values for a symmetric building. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Evaluation of plan configuration irregularity effects on seismic response demands of L-shaped MRF buildings,2018,L-shaped buildings; Plan configuration irregularity; Seismic design demands; Torsional irregularity ratio,Damage detection; Finite element method; Seismic design; Seismic response; Stress concentration; Structural frames; Torsional stress; Design of buildings; Irregular buildings; L-shaped building; Plan configuration irregularity; Re-entrant corners; Structural seismic response; Three dimensional finite element model; Torsional irregularity ratio; Architectural design; amplification; building; damage mechanics; earthquake damage; seismic design; seismic response; stiffness; structural response; torsion; vulnerability,0,0
12902,"The building seismic performance assessment can be defined as a posterior phase of investigation in which a detailed analysis is executed in order to evaluation of seismic damages and quantify the sequences of the earthquake for a building, this approach could be probabilistic evaluation or deterministic one.

A 3D mathematical modelling, pushover analysis by using SeismoStruct software. In addition, incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) and fragility curve according to FEMA P-58 are developed in order to obtain damage limits in term of performance levels of the case study building. Fragility curves are useful tools for showing the probability of structural damage due to earthquakes as a function of ground motion indices. IDA is performed for those simulated building using twelve ground motions with scaling peak ground acceleration increased every 0.1g until it achieved 1.5g to determine the drift capacity of the building in four performance levels, operational (OP), immediate occupancy (IO), life safety (LS) and near collapse (NC) as defined in FEMA P-58.

12903,"The improved mega sub-controlled structure system (MSCSS) significantly reduced the building responses and improved the control effectiveness as compared to conventional mega substructure (MSS). However, since the MSCSS is designed to resist future earthquakes, the seismic risk assessment of the structure remains a significant concern. In this study, the seismic risk analysis of MSCSS is performed to probabilistically compare the building performance and its resistance to future earthquake damage at certain categories of limit states (LSs), which include category one (slight damage, moderate damage, and collapse damage LS) and category two (damage control and collapse prevention). The comparison is realized with the result of the traditional MSS. The probability of exceedance of the above damage LS for a particular ground motion (GM) intensity (i.e. Sa (T1,5%)) is evaluated to assess and compare the vulnerability of these buildings. The evaluation is done through developing fragility curves and relationships for MSCSS and MSS. The result showed that the improved MSCSS has strong seismic resistance ability and provides a better response from a nonlinear analysis result. Furthermore, the fragility curve of moderate and collapse damage LSs indicated that MSCSS requires higher GM intensity to reach a moderate and collapse damage LS than MSS. That means MSCSS is the most stable with a significant difference as compared to its counterpart. This is also true for the second category of LS, that is, damage control and collapse prevention. While at the slight damage LS, both the MSCSS and MSS require approximately the same GM intensity to reach a slight damage LS, as the difference is not significant. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Evaluation of Seismic Fragility Analysis of the Mega Sub-Controlled Structural System (MSCSS),2020,damage measure (DM); fragility curve; intensity measure (IM); mega sub-controlled structure system (MSCSS); Mega substructure (MSS); seismic fragility assessment,collapse; earthquake damage; failure mechanism; ground motion; seismic design; seismic response; seismic retrofit; structural analysis,0,0
12904,"The assessment of historical elements at risk from earthquake loading presents a number of differences from the seismic evaluation of modern structures, for design or retrofitting purposes, which is covered by existing building codes, and for the development of fragility curves, procedures for which have been extensively developed in the past decade. This article briefly discusses: the hazard framework for historical assets, including a consideration of the appropriate return period to be used for such elements at risk; the intensity measures that could be used to describe earthquake shaking for the analysis of historical assets; and available approaches for their assessment. We then discuss various unique aspects of historical assets that mean the characterisation of earthquake loading must be different from that for modern structures. For example, historical buildings are often composed of heterogeneous materials (e.g., old masonry) and they are sometimes located where strong local site effects occur due to: steep topography (e.g., hilltops), basin effects or foundations built on the remains of previous structures. Standard seismic hazard assessment undertaken for modern structures and the majority of sites is generally not appropriate. Within the PERPETUATE project performance-based assessments, using nonlinear static and dynamic analyses for the evaluation of structural response of historical assets, were undertaken.

In this study, CPT and laboratory test data were compiled adjacent to the liquefaction-induced damaged buildings. To understand the capability of system response approach and damage assessment tools such as LSN and LPI, fifty five cases were selected. Results revealed that the system response can be applied to shallow silty soils in Adapazari. It was evaluated that soils with soil behavior index (Ic) greater than 2.6 may liquefy (even if they are located over the ground water level), if they have Plasticity Indices lower than 15%.

12909,"Vibration-based structural identification is an essential technique for assessing structural conditions by inferring information from the dynamic characteristics of structures. However, the robustness of such techniques in monitoring the progressive damage of real structures has been validated with only a handful of research efforts, largely due to the paucity of monitoring data recorded from damaged structures. In a recent experimental program, a mid-rise cold-formed steel building was constructed at full scale atop a large shake table and subsequently subjected to a unique multi-hazard scenario including earthquake, post-earthquake fire, and finally post-fire earthquake loading. Complementing the simulated hazard events, low-amplitude vibration tests, including ambient vibrations and white noise base excitation tests, were conducted throughout the construction and the test phases. Using the vibration data collected during the multi-hazard test program, this paper focuses on understanding the modal characteristics of the cold-formed steel building in correlation with the construction and the structural damage progressively induced by the simulated hazard events. The modal parameters of the building (i.e., natural frequencies, damping ratios, and mode shapes) are estimated using two input-output and two output-only time-domain system identification techniques. Agreement between the evolution of modal parameters and the observations of the progression of physical damage demonstrates the effectiveness of the vibration-based system identification techniques for structural condition monitoring and damage assessment.",Evolution of modal characteristics of a mid-rise cold-formed steel building during construction and earthquake testing,2020,cold-formed steel; damage assessment; modal parameters; shake table tests; system identification,EIGENSYSTEM REALIZATION-ALGORITHM; NATURAL EXCITATION TECHNIQUE; SYSTEM-IDENTIFICATION; AMBIENT VIBRATION; BENCHMARK PROBLEM; PHASE-I,0,0

The literature on the load bearing capacity of masonry walls in case of fire showed an enhanced performance of these elements, however the lack of normative documents, characterization of material properties at high temperatures and experimental results, for calibrating and validating the numerical models, indicates the need of further research.

12914,"Concrete filled steel tubular (CFST) columns are well known for excellent structural behavior and have been widely used in building structures, especially in high-rise and super high-rise buildings. However, the seismic performance of the steel reinforced concrete (SRC) beams to inclined circular CFST columns connection under cyclic loads was rarely studied before. This paper presents experimental and numerical study on the seismic performance of the connection. Based on the cyclic loading test results, with good ductility and energy dissipation capacity, the tested connection encased by the SRC ring beam showed good seismic performance and satisfied the principle of strong column & weak beam and strong joint & weak member in seismic design.

12915,"An experimental investigation of hospital building equipment is presented. Dynamic properties and seismic performance of typical ambulatory freestanding cabinets are assessed by unidirectional and bidirectional shake table tests, also considering the presence of internal partitions and cabinet contents. Vulnerability analysis is performed according to the most recent and reliable assessment methods, evaluating the influence of different parameters of the sample cabinets. The performance criteria referred within this research are the limit states reached by the specimens (ie, rocking and overturning) and by their contents (ie, overturning and breaking). Fragility curves are evaluated for the components and the contents, considering both acceleration and velocity intensity measures, and also using dimensionless intensity measures developed in recent studies. The outcomes of the present study confirm the findings of previous laboratory tests and numerical simulations carried out by the same authors and provide a further insight for the reliable seismic performance assessment of hospital cabinets and their contents. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Experimental assessment of the seismic performance of hospital cabinets using shake table testing,2019,hospital contents; overturning; rocking; seismic assessment; shake table testing; testing protocol,Earthquake engineering; Hospitals; Seismic waves; overturning; rocking; Seismic assessment; Shake table testing; Testing protocols; Earthquake effects; dynamic analysis; dynamic property; experimental study; multistorey building; seismic response; shaking table test; vulnerability,0,0
12916,"Damage to nonstructural systems during an earthquake can leave a building inoperable, causing economic losses, and extensive downtime. Among these nonstructural systems, partition wall damage has been reported frequently during past earthquakes while the seismic response of these systems is poorly understood. To better understand the seismic performance of integrated ceiling-piping-partition systems, a series of full-scale system-level experiments using a two-story steel bracedframe structure was conducted at the University of Nevada, Reno Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation site. In this study, responses and behaviors of partition walls were critically assessed through several design variables including: 1) framing systems, 2) partition wall heights, 3) partition wall geometries, 4) openings in partition walls, and 5) top connections. Experimental fragility curves were developed based on damage caused from inter-story drift. Along with fragilities, out-of-plane acceleration amplification factors for partition walls were computed. This study showed that the acceleration amplification factors for out-of-plane partition walls are comparable with the recommended amplification suggested by the code for flexible components.",Experimental fragility analysis of cold-formed steel-framed partition wall systems,2015,None,Earthquakes; Losses; Seismic response; Seismology; Structural analysis; Amplification factors; Experimental fragility curves; Flexible components; Fragility analysis; Network for earthquake engineering simulations; Nonstructural systems; Seismic Performance; University of Nevada; Walls (structural partitions),0,0
12917,"Q690 high strength steel (HSS) is a structural steel with yield-to-tensile ratio being generally greater than 0.90 and elongation lower than 20%, resulting in considerable decrease in steel member ductility. In seismic affecting zones, steel members are usually designed as compact sections to avoid premature local buckling for attaining fully developed plasticity. However, this approach increases the potential risk of fracture for Q690 steel structures. Thus, cyclic behaviors of Q690D HSS compact section beam-columns need to be thoroughly investigated. To this end, this paper conducted five cyclic loading tests of Q690 HSS compact H-section beam-columns based on a reliable testing system. The influences of the flange width-to-thickness ratio, web height-to-thickness ratio, axial-load ratio and overall slenderness on the failure mode, energy dissipation capacity and hysteretic behavior were analyzed. It shows that plastic local buckling dominates the failure mechanism of all the specimens without overall buckling being observed. The ultimate inter-story drift ratio was more than 1/50. The Q690 welded beam-columns with Class 1 and Class 2 H-section exhibit not only favorable plastic deformability but also excellent energy dissipation capacity and therefore could be applied in seismic steel frames. To attain accurate evaluation of damage and cyclic response, two damage models and two point-oriented hysteretic models were selected and combined to form four damage-based hysteretic models. The four hysteretic models were then implemented to simulate the cyclic loading experiments. It was found that the ultimate strength-oriented hysteretic model incorporated with Kumar Satish damage model provides the most accurate simulation. The hysteretic model parameters were calibrated using experiments data. The simulation results of the developed hysteretic model match well with those experimental curves. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Experimental investigation on cyclic behavior of Q690D high strength steel H-section beam-columns about strong axis,2019,Beam-column; Damage model; High strength steel; Hysteretic model; Seismic performance,Building materials; Connectors (structural); Cyclic loads; Energy dissipation; Failure (mechanical); High speed steel; Hysteresis; Seismology; Steel construction; Beam-columns; Cyclic loading experiment; Damage model; Energy dissipation capacities; Experimental investigations; Hysteretic model; Inter-story drift ratios; Seismic Performance; High strength steel; buckling; column; cyclic loading; damage mechanics; ductility; experimental study; failure mechanism; loading test; seismic response; steel,0,0
12918,"An experiment was conducted to investigate the seismic damage of a full-web steel-reinforced concrete (SRC) frame structure. A 1/3 scale, 2-bay, 3-story model of the full-web SRC frame was designed and constructed, and the load-displacement hysteretic curve, stiffness and strength degradation, displacement ductility, energy dissipation, crack propagation, failure mechanism, damage parameter, and evolution of seismic damage were investigated under low-reversed cyclic lateral loading. Based on an existing seismic damage model, the damage index was calculated and cumulative damage of the frame model was determined. The experimental results showed that the damage process of the full-web SRC frame structure consisted of four stages - namely, the undamaged stage, initial damage stage, stable development stage, the rapid development stage. Frame beams were damaged first, followed by damage to frame columns; Frame beams experienced the greatest damage. The damage value was largest for the first floor of the structure. Damage values calculated with the two methods were similar and accurately reflected the evolution of seismic damage.

12919,"In Italian seismic areas brickwork or stone masonry walls are commonly present in historic buildings. In recent years, the strengthening of masonry walls with external bonded (EB) fibre reinforced polymers (FRPs) has been increased to improve the tensile capacity of masonry that is normally weak. Many aspects of this strengthening method are not yet completely known; in particular, the debonding mechanisms of FRP strips need to be analysed through more investigation. The objectives have been, on one side, to investigate the behaviour of single-story shear brickwalls under in-plane loading with and without strengthening by Glass-FRP strips and, on the other hand, to analyze the mechanisms of debonding. Two experimental walls, built with historic solid clay bricks in scale 1/3rd, were subjected to precompression to simulate actual loading condition in masonry building for service loads and tested under cyclic shear force. One was strengthened after damage with EB GFRP strips - and then once again - subjected to the same loading until failure; another one was strengthened with GFRP strips without damage and subjected to the same path of loading until failure. The response of both models are presented and compared; finally, failure mechanisms are discussed.",Experimental response of masonry walls in-plane loading strengthened with GFRP strips,2020,Masonry; External bounded strengthening; GFRP strip; Cyclic shear tests; Debonding failure,LIMIT ANALYSIS; HOMOGENIZATION MODEL; NUMERICAL-ANALYSIS; DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; BOND BEHAVIOR; CHURCHES; EMILIA,0,0
12920,"This paper is concerned about precast reinforced concrete shear walls and the methods of assembling shear wall panels to form a reliable load transfer system. An assembling method is proposed using dry connection through a horizontal steel connector (H-connector) and high-strength bolts. To investigate the effectiveness and the design of such a connection method, three wall-connector assembly specimens with different connection details have been constructed and tested under monotonic loading while subjected to a constant vertical compression. The test results provided comprehensive data regarding the progressive transition of the load transfer mechanisms and showed that the performance of the shear wall assembly was generally satisfactory in terms of ensuring the full development of the shear wall strength and ductility. To assist in the interpretation of the experimental results and enable further parametric analysis, a detailed finite element model has been developed with incorporation of the main load transfer mechanisms, in addition to the description of the nonlinear behavior of the shear wall. The finite element model has been verified to represent well the actual behavior of the shear wall assembly, and it has provided further insight into the occurrence of slippage at the connection, the development of the bearing resistance of the bolts and the compression load transfer through contact in the later stage of the response.

12921,"In order to study the restoring force characteristics and seismic performance of steel transition connections in traditional buildings, the cyclic loading test was carried out on four transition connections with different slenderness ratios (8.9 and 12.5) of upper column and axial compression ratios (0.2 and 0.4) located between the rectangular and circular tubes. The test results show that the P-Δ effect of the transition column aggravates with the increase of the axial compression ratio and the slenderness ratio of the rectangular steel tube, and the ultimate bearing capacity of the test specimens gradually decreases. The formulas of the characteristic points on skeleton curves were presented by theoretical calculation, and the ideal hardening model of skeleton curves was developed. A damage model applied to the transition connections in traditional buildings considering cumulative energy dissipation and deformation on the perfoemance of specimens was introduced. The cumulative damage index in each of the hysteretic loops was defined, the overall seismic behaviors including unloading stiffness and other mechanical performance indexes were described quantitatively. Finally, the hysteretic rules at different loading stages were present, and the restoring force model used for transition connections in traditional buildings considering damage effects was proposed. By comparison, the proposed restoring force model considering damage effects agrees well with the test results, which can appropriately exhibit mechanical characteristics and hysteretic behavior of the traditional buildings under cyclic loads. © 2021, Editorial Office of Journal of Building Structures.

12922,"Damage of nonstructural components during past seismic events was shown to be not only a critical threat to life safety in extreme cases but also led to substantial reduction of functionality of buildings and other facilities. Because of the complex construction of nonstructural and architectural components, current standards provide only limited guidance for the seismic design. Suspended ceiling systems are among the less understood important nonstructural/architectural components in buildings for which design standards provide limited guidance. To understand the dynamic behavior of suspended ceiling systems, a series of full scale shake table tests of 20 ft × 53 ft and 20 ft × 20 ft ceiling systems were conducted at the Structural Engineering and Earthquake Simulation laboratory (SEESL) at University at Buffalo (UB). For the full scale dynamic testing, a new test frame providing a continuous suspended ceiling area of 1,060 ft2 was constructed on the tandem shake tables and was equipped with an open-loop shake table compensation procedure. The combined designs of the physical frame and of the shake table motion controllers allowed simulating the required floor/roof motion according to ICC-ES AC156 standard at the roof of the test structure. Various test configurations were selected in order to determine the influence of different system conditions and the effects or efficiency of various protective systems required by the current standard ASTM E580 for seismic design. Based on the test data and the failure mechanisms observed, damage states are defined, and fragility curves are developed. The results of the fragility analysis show that a ceiling system becomes more vulnerable as (a) it is subjected to multi-directional input motions, (b) heavier tiles are installed, (c) the size of a ceiling area increases, and (d) lateral restraints are not installed. In addition, simplified numerical models that can capture the special behavior of ceiling systems are developed and presented in a companion paper. This paper presents the experimental study of large area suspended ceiling systems involving test setup and configurations, test motions generated by a unique control system, and basic lessons gained from the experiments. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Experimental Study of Large Area Suspended Ceilings,2019,Compensated Floor Motion; Failure Mechanism; Fragility Analysis; Nonstructural Components; Shake Table Testing; Suspended Ceiling Systems,Architectural design; Building materials; Dynamics; Earthquake effects; Failure (mechanical); Floors; Roofs; Seismic design; Testing; Failure mechanism; Floor motion; Fragility analysis; Non-structural components; Shake table testing; Suspended ceilings; Ceilings,0,0
12923,"We propose a novel measurement method for directly measuring the lateral displacement of structures by using air-coupled ultrasound transducers. The normally-distributed far field of an ultrasound transducer in a lateral direction is taken advantage of for the purposes of measuring lateral displacement. The measurement system is composed of three flat-type air-coupled ultrasound transducers and a steel wire as a target. The ultrasound transducers are immobilized at a fixed point, whereas the steel wire is separately arranged on the opposite side. When the steel wire is displaced laterally, the lateral displacement is calculated utilizing the intensity ratio of the reflected ultrasound waves. The accuracy of the lateral displacement measurement is experimentally assessed to be within +/- 0.5 mm and the feasibility of the measurement system is discussed. The results show that a developed displacement measurement method will be usable in the field of structural health monitoring due to its accuracy and wide measurement range through the use of several ultrasound transducers.",Experimental study on lateral displacement measurement using air-coupled ultrasound transducers,2015,Lateral displacement; Air-coupled ultrasound; Earthquake; Building structure; Damage assessment; Structural health monitoring,None,0,0
12924,"Base isolation is accepted as the method of choice for mitigating the seismic risk of critical facilities, including hospitals. However, while many studies have confirmed the effectiveness of isolation in reducing seismic demands on attached nonstructural components, only a few have investigated the performance of unanchored building equipment and contents (ECs), and especially mobile ECs supported on wheels/casters, in base-isolated buildings. Motivated by the fact that about one-third of ECs in typical hospitals are supported on wheels/casters, this study investigated the seismic response of such ECs in base-isolated buildings through shake table tests. A comparative approach was adopted to examine the performance of lead-rubber bearing (LRB) and triple-friction pendulum (TFP) isolation systems against a conventional fixed-base hospital in reducing displacement and velocity demands on mobile ECs. It was observed that base isolation is effective in reducing seismic demands, especially velocity, on ECs. It was concluded that, in base-isolated buildings, locking the wheels/casters on ECs reduces EC response. Fragility curves were developed for mobile ECs on unlocked wheels and casters in base-isolated buildings. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Experimental Study on the Seismic Response of Equipment on Wheels and Casters in Base-Isolated Hospitals,2019,Base isolation; Hospital; Medical equipment; Mobile equipment; Nonstructural components; Wheels/casters,Bearings (structural); Biomedical equipment; Earthquake effects; Hospitals; Locks (fasteners); Seismic response; Base isolation; Base-isolated building; Building equipments; Comparative approach; Critical facilities; Lead rubber bearing; Mobile equipments; Non-structural components; Wheels,0,0
12926,"In Europe, the design of new structures according to modern regulations requires a uniform hazard spectrum for a given return period (e.g., 475 years). The assumption is that the resulting collapse probability is equally uniform for all structures, regardless of their structural properties or location. However, the uncertainty in the collapse capacity and hazard curves at different sites lead to an unequal level of risk. This discrepancy is undesirable given that some inhabitants will live in dwellings with a lower seismic safety than others living in structures designed according to the same regulation. The estimation of risk-targeted hazard maps allows for the definition of a design ground motion leading to a uniform level of risk. Using hundreds of fragility models developed for European buildings and hazard results from the SHARE project, we calculate risk-targeted hazard maps for a pre-established annual collapse probability.",Exploring Risk-Targeted Hazard Maps for Europe,2016,None,SEISMIC DESIGN MAPS; VULNERABILITY FUNCTIONS; FRAGILITY CURVES; PERFORMANCE; SAFETY; DAMAGE,0,0
12927,"Simplified seismic assessment procedures relying on displacement-based formulations have recently been implemented for the evaluation of the seismic performance in buildings and bridges. For bridges, displacement-based assessment procedures have been formulated to predict the displacement response at several performance levels defined based on the expected damage on the structural elements. These displacement profiles have been subsequently used to estimate the performance level achieved under a given seismic hazard intensity and to develop damage fragility curves. For buildings, these concepts have been extended to compute economic losses in agreement with current performance-based earthquake engineering procedures. In this study, existing displacement-based formulations for the approximate seismic assessment of single-column multi-span continuous RC bridges, with non-sacrificial shear keys for the pier-to-deck connections, are extended for the computation of expected annual losses under transverse direction excitation. Additionally, an iterative response spectrum analysis procedure, which directly considers higher mode effects, is proposed for computing the displacement response, and these results are also used to estimate direct expected annual losses. Results show that both procedures tend to compute higher losses when compared with those obtained with a fully probabilistic loss assessment framework, using demand estimations computed with nonlinear response history analysis. Results also show that the simplified loss assessment procedure is highly sensitive to the definition of the collapse fragility curve. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Extension of displacement-based simplified procedures to the seismic loss assessment of multi-span RC bridges,2021,bridges; displacement-based assessment; expected annual loss; loss assessment; seismic response,Earthquake engineering; Losses; Seismology; Spectrum analysis; Assessment procedure; Displacement profiles; Displacement response; Displacement-based formulations; Expected annual loss; Nonlinear response history analysis; Response spectrum analysis; Simplified procedure; Damage detection; assessment method; bridge; displacement; probability; reinforced concrete; seismic response; structural analysis,0,0
12928,"In this study, low and medium-rise non-ductile RC frame structures were selected and strengthened by external GFRP confinement. Non-linear time-history analyses, followed by damage analyses, were carried out for the unstrengthened and strengthened frames under different near/far-fault earthquakes, without and with soilstructure interaction (SSI). The obtained results indicated that the external GFRP confinement successfully prevents the collapse of non-ductile RC frames located in near-fault areas in 2 km proximity to the fault. In 5-10 km proximity to the fault, GFRP confinement reduces the damage from severe damage to moderate damage or from moderate damage to light damage. The results also reaffirm that external GFRP confinement can be effective to fix design errors. With raft foundation on stiff soil, the SSI effect on near-fault earthquake damage of the frames can be negligible. These conclusions can be helpful for mitigating the seismic risk of 1970s-codecompliance or design-error structures.",External GFRP confinement to decrease near-fault earthquake damage of reinforced concrete structures considering soil-structure interaction,2021,GFRP; Retrofitting; Near-fault earthquake; Damage assessment; Reinforced concrete frame; Soil-structure interaction,STRESS-STRAIN MODEL; BEAM-COLUMN JOINTS; SEISMIC PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT; DYNAMIC-RESPONSE; GROUND MOTIONS; FRP CONFINEMENT; PLASTIC HINGE; RC BUILDINGS; DESIGN; FRAMES,0,0
12929,"Masonry buildings constructed along busy roads are vulnerable to vehicular impacts. As most of these impacts are likely to occur at low velocity due to severe braking by drivers to avoid catastrophe, the present study reports a failure analysis of masonry walls subject to low velocity impacts. An explicit finite element modelling method incorporating homogenised anisotropic masonry material developed previously for static loading was validated through low velocity impact test datasets reported in the literature. Subsequently, an extensive study was undertaken to evaluate the impact damage patterns of masonry walls of varied boundary conditions, aspect ratios, and slenderness ratios. This paper identifies a threshold impact energy, below which contemporary single leaf masonry walls irrespective of their boundary conditions and aspect ratio, exhibit global damage with varied failure patterns. Slenderness ratio of the impacted wall is shown as the most important parameter in resisting impact loads.

In this paper, based on the Weibull distribution model modified by the writer with the aim of exploring different mechanical properties of three types of shotcrete, the acoustic emission (AE) technique is used to carry out uniaxial compression tests on different shotcrete, and the failure mechanism of different shotcrete is analyzed according to the AE energy value and cumulative hit counts under loads. The experimental results are consistent with the damage mechanism quantitatively described by the modified Weibull distribution model. This damage model with fewer parameters and simple form, which can quantitatively described the whole process of specimens, including post-peak stress, from the beginning of loading to the complete failure.

12931,"As an alternative to the very time consuming Non-Linear Response History Analysis (NLRHA) approach, this research aimed to employ the F2MPA (Flexibly-supported 2 DOF Modal Pushover Analysis) approach in developing fragility curves of flexibly-supported plan-asymmetric structures. To do this task, the F2MPA approach is employed to approximately calculate the seismic non-linear response of soil-RC plan asymmetric building systems considering the eccentricity and soil structure interaction (SSI) simultaneously with lower computational costs. Using an appropriate hysteretic model, the F2MPA-based IDA (Incremental Dynamic Analysis) procedure, developed in this study, can accurately estimate the seismic response of the superstructure considering stiffness deterioration, strength loss and pinching behavior of RC members. To examine the applicability of the proposed method, an 8-story RC dual lateral load resistant building under an ensemble of near-fault pulse-like events is used. The comparison of the NLRHA-based and F2MPA-based fragility functions showed a good agreement. Considering the time effectiveness of the proposed approximate method (less than the 0.01 of the NLRHA method), the method is found to be very attractive for practical soil-asymmetric structures.

Traditionally in fast boats like fast ferries, hydrofoils, patrol boats, the typical materials are Aluminum alloy or composites, both those materials have advantages and disadvantages, but the new development of technologies made possible to combine them, in order to have a new material, combining the advantages of both, in terms of fatigue resistance, firefighting characteristics. In this paper, predominant mode II fatigue delamination tests of fiber metal laminates made of alternating layers of 2024-T3 aluminum alloy sheets and unidirectional E-Glass/epoxy laminates are presented.

In particular, the numerical model is based on the cohesive zone approach and on the analytical definition of a damage parameter, directly related to the fatigue crack growth rate da/dN.

12933,"Roof-to-wall-connection (RTWC) is critical in the loading path of wood-frame residential buildings, whose fatigue performance under varying wind loading is investigated in this paper. To get an insight on the wind-induced fatigue behavior at low to moderate hourly mean wind speeds and to demonstrate the effects of adhesives on the fatigue performance of RTWC, two types of fatigue experiments, namely the constant and the varying amplitude loading tests, were conducted on three RTWC configurations with and without elastomeric construction adhesives. Based on the constant amplitude loading test results, fatigue life prediction models were developed, and the reduction in the static load capacity due to cyclic loadings were estimated. Adhesives are shown to increase the endurance limit of the RTWCs, which is desirable to enhance the life-cycle performance of wood buildings. The varying amplitude loading test results indicate that buildings in non-hurricane regions are vulnerable to fatigue damage at a low-level mean wind speed. It may induce loadings above the endurance limit of the RTWCs. On the other hand, the linear Miner's cumulative fatigue damage model can be reasonably used to predict fatigue damage of the RTWCs when subject to multi-amplitude wind loadings. Toenailed connections generally fail in a less ductile manner at a certain number of load cycles with no warnings compared to the connections with adhesives that fail in a more ductile manner.

12934,"Based on recent findings, the main span of the Vincent Thomas suspension bridge crosses directly over the Palos Verdes fault, which has the capacity to produce a devastating earthquake. In spring 2000, the bridge underwent a major retrofit using visco-elastic dampers. This study focuses on seismic vulnerability of the retrofitted bridge. Three-dimensional member-based detailed and panel-based simplified finite element models of the bridge are developed. In order to show the appropriateness of these models, eigenproperties of the bridge are evaluated and compared with the system identification results obtained using ambient vibration data. In addition, a model validation is performed by simulating the dynamic response during the 1994 Northridge earthquake and comparing with the measured response. Finally, considering a set of strong ground motions in the Los Angeles area, nonlinear time history analyses are performed and the ductility demands of critical sections are presented in terms of fragility curves. The study shows that a ground motion with peak ground acceleration of 0.9 g or greater will result in plastic hinge formation at one or more locations with a probability of exceedance of 50%. Also, it is found that the effect of dampers is minimal for low to moderate earthquakes and high for strong earthquakes. © 2015, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Finite element model development, validation and probabilistic seismic performance evaluation of Vincent Thomas suspension bridge",2015,fragility curve; scenario earthquake; seismic performance; suspension bridge; system identification,Finite element method; Identification (control systems); Religious buildings; Seismic waves; Suspension bridges; Fragility curves; Nonlinear time history analysis; Northridge earthquakes; Peak ground acceleration; Probability of exceedance; Scenario earthquakes; Seismic Performance; Seismic performance evaluation; Earthquakes,0,0

The fire started inside waste material stored on the unloading ramp, then developed as a result of the burning of Styrofoam insulation along the building walls. Damage from the fire took a section of the reinforced slab above the ramp on which the parking lot was located. The elements of the beam-and-slab floor were partially destroyed. Precast panels of “filigree” lost adhesion to the concrete overlay formed in situ. On-site inspection and evaluation of the degree of structural element damage were undertaken. The various concepts for repair methods for the significantly damaged structural elements were considered. The support by the use of additional steel structure was suggested as more efficient than the partial replacement of the damaged slab with new structure. In the case of another fire the steel bar structure also had to be protected by claddings (using spray method or curtains made of plasterboard).

12937,"EDF has to analyze the relevance and develop probabilistic risk assessments for external hazards that haven't been screened out. The following article aims at describing the general methodology under development at EDF R&D for a graded approach to probabilistic risk assessment of natural hazards. It more accurately describes exploratory methodological work for the first phase of this Graded Approach applied to external flooding. Graded Approach is a set of methods for analyzing probabilistic risk estimation. It implements analysis with more and more detailed levels of hazards, consequences, and accident sequences. It is structured in three phases, from the most simplified analysis to more detailed analysis, and ultimately the development of a model close to a Standard PSA (Probabilistic Safety Analysis) model ([I]). Each phase contains the identification for various scenarios, the estimation of frequency for each scenario, the modeling of the sequences and the quantification of risk The first phase of the Graded Approach has been applied to a pilot study for External River flooding. Currently the methodology is only focused on the reactor building, with the classical 24 hours PSA duration and only for core damage risk. • Step 1 - Scenarios Identification The different Flood Scenarios are developed by the identification of critical levels concerning protection and mitigation capabilities. The objective is to establish water levels corresponding to different losses of materials important for safety. Preventive human actions (the implementation of protection ...) are included in this scenario analysis. Their reliability has been quantified. • Step 2 - Frequency Estimation for each scenario Starting from a given water level on the site, we determine the rate leading to this level. We use a 2D hydrodynamic model where different hydrological scenarios are simulated based on realistic assumptions. Then, we assign a occurrence frequency of the most disadvantageous scenario. This approach is the opposite of the usual used in deterministic studies where, for a given return period, the water level on the platform is evaluated. • Step 3 - Sequences modeling We use the Internal Events PSA models because their level of details allows understanding of the transient and of the real impact on risk, especially the risk of core damage. Modeling is therefore to adapt the PSA model. This is done by introducing the frequency initiators and introducing the loss of the material based on developed scenarios and also by modifying some mitigation actions. • Step 4 - Risk quantification In phase 1 conservative assumptions are made when quantifying (e.g. probability of occurrence of hazard induced by flooding). Post-initiator operator actions (i.e. local actions) that are affected are analyzed using procedures and their failure is quantified. The risk of core damage is quantified for each scenario. This methodology is a prospective one. It has not been subject to any industrial validation. It is developed as part of a pilot study. The future R&D program includes flooding methodology for seaside plants, other hazard methodology (for instance for extreme winds) and methodology for spent fuel pools and in the long term. We also have to develop the methodology for the more detailed phases and to evaluate the gain obtained. © 2015 by the American Nuclear Society.",First set of methodological elements for graded probabilistic assessment of external flooding at EDF,2015,External hazards; Flooding; PSA,Floods; Frequency estimation; Hazards; Oil well flooding; Risk assessment; Risks; Safety engineering; Water levels; 2D hydrodynamic models; External hazards; Hydrological scenarios; Probabilistic assessments; Probabilistic Risk Assessment; Probabilistic safety analysis; Probability of occurrence; PSA; Risk perception,0,0
12938,"Floods can cause damage to transportation and energy infrastructure, disrupt the delivery of services, and take a toll on public health, sometimes even causing significant loss of life. Although scientists widely stress the compelling need for resilience against extreme events under a changing climate, tools for dealing with expected hazards lag behind. Not only does the socio-economic, ecologic and cultural impact of floods need to be considered, but the potential disruption of a society with regard to priority adaptation guidelines, measures, and policy recommendations need to be considered as well. The main downfall of current impact assessment tools is the raster approach that cannot effectively handle multiple metadata of vital infrastructures, crucial buildings, and vulnerable land use (among other challenges). We have developed a powerful cross-platform flood impact assessment tool (FLIAT) that uses a vector approach linked to a relational database using open source program languages, which can perform parallel computation. As a result, FLIAT can manage multiple detailed datasets, whereby there is no loss of geometrical information. This paper describes the development of FLIAT and the performance of this tool. © 2019 by the authors.","FLIAT, an object-relational GIS tool for flood impact assessment in Flanders, Belgium",2019,Disruption potential; Flood damage assessment; Flood impact assessment tool (FLIAT); Open source program languages; Parallel computation; Urban floods; Vector approach,Economics; Floods; Geographic information systems; Land use; Damage assessments; Disruption potential; Impact assessment tools; Open-source program; Parallel Computation; Urban floods; Damage detection; adaptive management; climate change; design flood; detection method; environmental impact assessment; extreme event; flood; flood damage; GIS; land use change; natural hazard; parallel computing; software; Belgium; Flanders,0,0
12939,"Floods are among the extreme manifestations of the circulation of water in nature, flood protection is also a process which is never ending for human civilization. It began long ago in the distant past and will always be, unfortunately with very uncertain results, a component of each successive stage of the development of society. At present trends around the globe appear to be indicating that in subsequent periods the danger from flooding will increase. The range and extremity of flood episodes demonstrate the necessity for a complex proposal for building or supplementing flood protection measures in potentially flooded territories. In association with research of flood risk and meeting the targets of the Directive, more and more attention is continually being paid to methods focused on the assessment and analysis of risk, because they enable us to assess the effectiveness of costs of mitigating measures, and thus optimize investments. The analysis of flood risk can also be derived independently of the relation of the object of risk to the unwanted events, or floods. The paper deals with the resolution of the problem of managing flood risk with the aim of effective management focusing on reducing flood risks and thus increasing the measure of flood protection. It is elaborated in the sense of currently valid Slovak legislation in the field of flood protection, primarily according to the already mentioned Directive 2007/60/EC on the assessment and management of flood risks. © 2018 WIT Press.",Flood damage assessment,2018,Bodva river basin; Economic flood damages; Flood damage; Loss curves,None,0,0
12940,"Natural hazards do not only affect millions of people, but also cause material damages up to 300 billion USD per year worldwide. The SIDS (Small Island Developing States) are characterized by an extremely high vulnerability to these hazards, due to their low-lying, densely populated cities and their fragile economy. To limit the consequences of these hazards, technocratic interventions do not suffice. Therefore, new approaches that focus on flood risk management are developed. In this context, Annotto Bay, Jamaica, was chosen as a case study area to perform a flood damage assessment. In this study, a flood damage map was created for the 2001 flood caused by Tropical Storm Michelle. This map focuses on three types of damage: building, road and crop damage. The first type was calculated using the exact GPS locations of the buildings, as well as average replacement values for each building type and flood damage functions. The total building damage was then combined per land-use polygon to have an orderly visual view of the damage spread. Furthermore, the road damage was calculated, based on a road network extracted from satellite imagery. In a next step, as buildings are mostly located in proximity of roads, buffers were created around the road network, resulting in a more accurate visual view of the building damage spread. Then the crop damage was calculated based on maximum damage values for banana plantains and other crops, combined with the crop damage functions. The final result is a total damage map, visualizing the location of high risk areas with a high accuracy. Additionally, the total calculated damage was compared to the actual damage caused by the 2001 flood. This comparison shows promising results. © 2016 WIT Press.","Flood damage assessment in a GIS - Case study for Annotto Bay, Jamaica",2016,Damage map; Flooding analysis; Natural hazards; Risk assessment,Buildings; Crops; Economics; Flood control; Flood damage; Geographic information systems; Hazards; Land use; Motor transportation; Risk assessment; Risk management; Roads and streets; Satellite imagery; Building damage; Damage assessments; Damage functions; Flood risk management; High-risk areas; Material damages; Natural hazard; Small island developing state; Damage detection; building; flood damage; flood forecasting; GIS; GPS; mapping; natural hazard; risk assessment; small island state; vulnerability; Jamaica,0,0
12941,"In this study, a flood damage assessment method was proposed for the assessment of flood risk in data-poor river basins by using a physical-based numerical model, satellite-based information and socio-economic factors. The Pampanga river basin of the Philippines was selected for the case study. For the flood damage assessment, hazard characteristics, such as flood depth and duration, were computed using the rainfall runoff inundation model. Agriculture and households, which are major exposures in flood-prone areas, were taken into account for the flood damage assessment. The potential damage to agriculture was estimated by using the damage functions of agriculture and flood characteristics. The damage functions of agriculture for each growing stage were defined as the function of flood depth and duration. Field investigations and questionnaire surveys were conducted at the selected barangays (villages) in the Pampanga river basin to develop a methodology for household damage estimation. The damage estimation approach for damage to household buildings including assets, was developed based on the flood and household characteristics. The potential damage to house building and assets was estimated. The estimated damage of agriculture and households was compared with the reported values. © 2015 The Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management (CIWEM) and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Flood damage assessment in the Pampanga river basin of the Philippines,2016,Damage function; exposure; flood damage assessment; hazards; vulnerability,agriculture; estimation method; flood control; flood damage; flooding; numerical model; rainfall-runoff modeling; risk assessment; satellite data; socioeconomic impact; vulnerability; Central Luzon; Luzon; Pampanga; Pampanga Basin; Philippines,0,0
12943,"The damage triggered by different flood events costs the Italian economy millions of euros each year. This cost is likely to increase in the future due to climate variability and economic development. In order to avoid or reduce such significant financial losses, risk management requires tools which can provide a reliable estimate of potential flood impacts across the country. Flood loss functions are an internationally accepted method for estimating physical flood damage in urban areas. In this study, we derived a new flood loss function for Italian residential structures (FLF-IT), on the basis of empirical damage data collected from a recent flood event in the region of Emilia-Romagna. The function was developed based on a new Australian approach (FLFA), which represents the confidence limits that exist around the parameterized functional depth-damage relationship. After model calibration, the performance of the model was validated for the prediction of loss ratios and absolute damage values. It was also contrasted with an uncalibrated relative model with frequent usage in Europe. In this regard, a threefold cross-validation procedure was carried out over the empirical sample to measure the range of uncertainty from the actual damage data. The predictive capability has also been studied for some sub-classes of water depth. The validation procedure shows that the newly derived function performs well (no bias and only 10% mean absolute error), especially when the water depth is high. Results of these validation tests illustrate the importance of model calibration. The advantages of the FLF-IT model over other Italian models include calibration with empirical data, consideration of the epistemic uncertainty of data, and the ability to change parameters based on building practices across Italy.",Flood loss modelling with FLF-IT: a new flood loss function for Italian residential structures,2017,None,OF-THE-ART; DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; INPUT-OUTPUT; IMPACT; VALIDATION; FLEMOCS,0,0
12944,"This paper discusses the development of a methodology for prioritising flood mitigation works in urban areas. Utilising a benefit-cost framework, it has been devised to assess damages caused by overland flows to residential, commercial and industrial buildings and other built environment assets. Stage-damage curves have been developed using the latest available research from the Natural Hazards Research Centre at Macquarie University. Where possible, indirect costs such as clean-up costs, disruptions to services and utilities, and impacts on health, have also been considered. The model has been designed to assess both structural and non-structural intervention options, in order to facilitate efficient allocation of resources. Implementation has been undertaken in GIS to efficiently access and analyse data sources. Development of this model has highlighted relevance for various levels of government, from site-specific assessments by local councils and CMAs to policy development by state and federal governments. Various specific applications are considered, including: estimation of Average Annual Damages (AAD), benefit-cost analysis of individual flood mitigation projects, prioritisation of investments across a range of available projects and efficient policy development in natural resource management and natural hazards management.

12945,"Disaster risk assessment is vital to determining needs for disaster countermeasures and promoting their implementation. However, it is difficult to conduct evidence-based risk assessment in flood-prone areas of Asia due to area-specific characteristics such as limited local data on natural and societal conditions and local lifestyles of persons who have adapted to frequent floods. This paper proposes basic flood risk assessment considering these characteristics and explores a case study conducted in a flood-prone area of the Pampanga River basin in the Republic of the Philippines to verify our method. We surveyed local household members as part of the study to understand local situations, finding that past flood damage cost little thanks to building structures adapted to frequent flooding and to local ways of protecting property during floods. We also found that the use of depth-damage curves developed for urban areas may overestimate anticipated damage expected in future floods when these curves are applied to flood-prone rural areas. For this reason, we propose a method of flood risk assessment for evaluating the societal impact on residents' lives using observed thresholds of inundation depth by flood simulation, rather than using a method that estimates damage cost. Application of our proposal to the case study area confirmed its applicability and effectiveness in evidence-based planning for reducing flood risk.","Flood Risk Assessment in Asian Flood Prone Area with Limited Local Data - Case Study in Pampanga River Basin, Philippines -",2016,flood; risk assessment; inundation; flood-prone area; Asia,None,0,0
12947,"Flood hazard is increasing in frequency and magnitude in major South East Asian metropolitan areas due to fast urban development and changes in climate, threatening people's property and life. Typically, flood management actions are mostly focused on large-scale defences, such as river embankments or discharge channels or tunnels. However, these are difficult to implement in town centres without affecting the value of their heritage districts and might not provide sufficient mitigation. Therefore, urban heritage buildings may become vulnerable to flood events, even when they were originally designed and built with intrinsic resilient measures, based on the local knowledge of the natural environment and its threats at the time. Their aesthetic and cultural and economic values mean that they can represent a proportionally high contribution to losses in any event. Hence it is worth investigating more localized, tailored mitigation measures. Vulnerability assessment studies are essential to inform the feasibility and development of such strategies. In this study we propose a multilevel methodology to assess the flood vulnerability and risk of residential buildings in an area of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, characterized by traditional timber housing. The multiscale flood vulnerability model is based on a wide range of parameters, covering building-specific parameters, neighbourhood conditions and catchment area conditions. The obtained vulnerability index shows the ability to reflect different exposure by different building types and their relative locations. The vulnerability model is combined with high-resolution fluvial and pluvial flood maps providing scenario events with 0.1 % annual exceedance probability (AEP). A damage function of generic applicability is developed to compute the economic losses at individual building and sample levels. The study provides evidence that results obtained for a small district can be scaled up to the city level, to inform both generic and specific protection strategies.","Flood vulnerability and risk assessment of urban traditional buildings in a heritage district of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",2020,None,DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PRECIPITATION; FUTURE; MODEL; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; HAZARD,0,0
12948,"The probability of a reinforced concrete building to sustain cumulative damage during afterschock sequences is a key issue for crisis management. Assessments of time-variant probabilities of damage states are made herein for reinforced concrete building models the city of Thessaloniki, Greece, in the case of a mainshock scenario. The elongation of the first eigenperiod of the building is used as the engineering demand parameter in the computation of the fragility curves for the building models. Period elongation is selected, as it is readily available in the case of buildings with permanent monitoring systems, which are part of a critical infrastructure, and it may be used complementary to post-earthquake building inspection in order to assess earthquake damage. The increase of the vulnerability of the buildings with time due to potential earthquake damage accumulation is modeled with a probabilistic approach, which is based on the Markov chain. During the aftershock sequences the probability to exceed period elongation thresholds accumulates. Additional risk due to aftershocks as a function of time is estimated and the developed framework is based on the traffic-light concept (red-orange-green) for building-tagging with respect to seismic risk to support earthquake risk management in the course of aftershock sequences. © 2019 The authors.",Forecasting time-variable earthquake risk for reinforced concrete buildings during aftershock sequences based on operational earthquake forecasting and resonance period elongation,2019,"Aftershock Sequence, Time-variant Damage State Probability; Building Tagging","Computational methods; Concrete buildings; Damage detection; Earthquake effects; Elongation; Engineering geology; Markov processes; Reinforced concrete; Risk management; Risk perception; Structural dynamics; Aftershock sequence; Building inspections; Earthquake damages; Earthquake forecasting; Engineering demand parameters; Probabilistic approaches; Thessaloniki , Greece; Time variant; Earthquake engineering",0,0
12950,"The nonlinear behaviour of connections between structural elements is critical to the performance of mass-timber structures under seismic loads. However, limited work has been developed in nonlinear modelling and fragility assessment of mass-timber structures. To improve the accuracy of this approach, in particular when considering structures with ring-doweled moment-resisting connections, a nonlinear modelling approach and fragility assessment are proposed and a prototype example of a three-story building is analysed herein as a case study. For the case study, connections and members were designed following the prescriptions in Eurocode 5 and Eurocode 8, considering a high ductility structure. The mechanical properties of the structure are modelled as random variables to evaluate the impact of uncertainty on the prediction of the structural performance, in particular, on the probability of occurrence of ductile and brittle failure modes. The structure is studied under both nonlinear static analysis and multi-record incremental dynamic analysis. From these, fragility curves for different damage levels are computed and a q-factor is proposed. Results indicate that the requirements of Eurocode 5 and Eurocode 8 are sufficient to guarantee adequate performance for this type of structure, albeit these may be overconservative. Moreover, it is shown that uncertainties in material properties have a significant impact on the collapse capacity of these structures. © WCTE 2018 Committee.",Fragility analysis of a mass-timber frame structure with ring-doweled moment-resisting connections,2018,Fragility functions; Ring-doweled connections; Seismic assessment; Timber moment frames,Codes (standards); Mechanical properties; Nonlinear systems; Q factor measurement; Seismology; Structural analysis; Timber; Fragility function; Incremental dynamic analysis; Moment frames; Moment-resisting connection; Non-linear static analysis; Probability of occurrence; Seismic assessment; Structural performance; Nonlinear analysis,0,0
12952,"Generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansion-based simulation technique is used to investigate the influence of input parameter uncertainty, on peak response quantities and fragility curves of base-isolated liquid storage tanks. Unidirectional horizontal sinusoidal base excitation is considered to develop the fragility curves for the base-isolated liquid storage tanks. Extensively used laminated rubber bearing (LRB), with linear force-deformation behavior, is considered as the isolation system. The liquid storage tank is modeled using a widely accepted lumped mass model. The failure of the liquid storage tank is defined corresponding to the elastic buckling of the tank wall. The uncertainties are considered in the isolator parameters and in the base excitation. Considerable difference in the peak response estimation is observed when the input parameters are represented using different probability distributions, especially when the uncertainties are higher. It is also observed that when the uncertainties in the input parameters increase, probability of failure at given amplitude of the excitation increases. It is demonstrated that the probability of failure estimated using gPC expansion-based simulations closely matches the same obtained through the direct Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Significant influence of the time period of the isolation system is observed on the fragility curves of the base-isolated liquid storage tanks.

12953,"The fragility of concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) frame structures with buckling-restrained braces (BRBs) subjected to multiple earthquakes is studied in this paper. First, a fiber beam element model with rate-dependent concrete and steel material properties is developed for CFST members and, then, the effect of the strain rate on the seismic response of the CFST frame structure is investigated numerically. The influence of BRBs on the seismic response of the CFST frame structure is then comparatively analyzed. The seismic responses of the CFST frame structure with BRBs under single mainshocks and earthquake sequences are investigated, and the fragility curves are generated using probabilistic seismic demand analysis. The obtained roof displacement and inter-story drift ratio (ISDR) of the structure decreased by 10.2% and 6.9%, respectively, when obtained while considering the strain rate effect, compared with those obtained without consideration of the strain rate effect. BRBs can effectively improve the seismic performance of the CFST frame structure in that the maximum roof displacement and ISDR can be reduced by 45.1% and 43.9%, respectively. Compared with those under single mainshocks, the maximum roof displacement and ISDR of the structure with BRBs under earthquake sequences significantly increase. The fragility of the BRB structure under earthquake sequences is more severe than that under single mainshocks.

12954,"Seismic damage assessment plays an important role in performancebased design engineering and seismic risk analysis. This assessment is dealt with in terms of fragility curves. An approach to estimate seismic fragility of a pier-supported wharf is developed in this paper. The damage or performance state of the specific wharf structure is determined by the capacity spectrum method proposed by ATC-40. The probability distribution for a so-called fragility curve is expressed in a lognormal cumulative probability density function and the two parameters associated with the distribution are estimated by the maximum likelihood method, treating each event of damage as a realization from a Bernoulli experiment. In this paper, we consider the uncertainty associated with the ground motion by collecting the records of ground motion near the site and analyzing the probabilistic characteristics of the records. We also analyze the uncertainties associated with the capacity spectrum and the thresholds of different damage states by considering the factors of material and soil properties that affect the overall capacity of the structure. Finally, fragility curves considering the above three type of uncertainties are constructed and compared for the target pier-supported wharf.

12955,"More than 40% of bridges in Southwest China have piers over 40 m height. The seismic behaviour of these bridges is critical, especially exposed to near-fault pulse-like ground motions. This paper conducts fragility analyses to assess the seismic vulnerability of tall pier bridges under near-fault motions. Fragility curves are developed for a typical 50-m tall pier and a 10 m conventional pier with probabilistic seismic demand models (PSDMs). When developing the PSDMs, curvature ductility at pier base is used as the demand parameter; the 5% damped spectral acceleration of the fundamental period (S-a(T-1, 5%)) is employed as an intensity measure of the motions. Results show that the 50 m pier is less vulnerable than the 10 m pier under both the near-fault and far-field motions and is unlikely to collapse in real earthquake events. Furthermore, the seismic fragility of the 50 m pier is found highly related to the pre-defined damage state capacities, indicating that the damage states should be carefully specified to properly estimate the vulnerability of tall piers. Finally, analyses are conducted for piers with heights of 40, 60, 70, and 80 m, extending the conclusions obtained from 50 m pier to a class of tall piers.",Fragility analysis of tall pier bridges subjected to near-fault pulse-like ground motions,2020,Tall pier bridges; near-fault motions; seismic performance; fragility analysis; vulnerability assessment,SEISMIC DEMAND MODELS; INTENSITY MEASURES; SPECTRAL SHAPE; PERFORMANCE; EARTHQUAKE; SIMULATION; BUILDINGS; CURVES,0,0

Two different nail spacings for roof sheathing panels and three types of roof-to-wall connections were considered.

The tornado simulator-based dataset was used for determination of the statistics of wind loads, without considering the translational motion effects of tornado vortices. The results show that the failure probability of roof is dependent on the proximity of a tornado to a building and the opening azimuth on walls. Additionally, the combined effects of pressure drop and aerodynamic interactions dominate the failure modes of roof system. The obtained fragility curves in this study can be used to estimate the maximum tangential wind speed of the tornado vortices and the local oncoming tangential wind speed at roof height.

12958,"While the container crane is an important part of daily port operations, it has received little attention in comparison with other infrastructures such as buildings and bridges. Crane collapses owing to earthquakes affect the operation of the port and indirectly impact the economy. This study proposes fragility analyses for various damage levels of a container crane, thus enabling the port owner and partners to better understand the seismic vulnerability presented by container cranes. A large number of nonlinear time-history analyses were applied for a three-dimensional (3D) finite element model to quantify the vulnerability of a Korean case-study container crane considering the uplift and derailment behavior. The uncertainty of the demand and capacity of the crane structures were also considered through random variables, i.e., the elastic modulus of members, ground motion profile, and intensity. The results analyzed in the case of the Korean container crane indicated the probability of exceeding the first uplift with or without derailment before the crane reached the structure's limit states. This implies that under low seismic excitation, the crane may be derailed without any structural damage. However, when the crane reaches the minor damage state, this condition is always coupled with a certain probability of uplift with or without derailment. Furthermore, this study proposes fragility curves developed for different structural periods to enable port stakeholders to assess the risk of their container crane. © 2019 by the authors.

12960,"Earthquake loss estimation in composite-steel moment resisting frames (MRFs) necessitates a proper estimation of the level of damage in steel beam-to-slab connections. These usually feature welded headed shear studs to ensure the composite action between the concrete slab and the steel beam. In partially composite steel beams, earthquake-induced damage in the shear studs and the surrounding concrete occurs due to shear stud slip demands. Within such a context, this paper proposes shear slip-based fragility functions to estimate the probability of being or exceeding four damage states in steel beam-slab connections. These damage states include cracking and crushing of the concrete slab in the vicinity of the shear studs, as well as damage in the shear studs themselves. The developed fragility functions are obtained from a gathered dataset of 42 cyclic push-out tests. They incorporate uncertainty associated with specimen-to-specimen variability, along with epistemic uncertainty arising from the finite number of available experimental results. An application of the proposed fragility functions is conducted on a six-story building with composite-steel MRFs. It is shown that steel beam-slab connections along the building height only exhibit light cracking (i.e., crack sizes of 0.3 mm or less) at design basis seismic events. At seismic intensities associated with a low probability of occurrence seismic event (i.e., return period of 2475 years) the nonlinear building simulations suggest that the 25% reduction of the shear stud resistance in steel beam-slab connections with beam depths of 500 mm or less is not imperative to maintain the integrity of the shear stud connectors. © Copyright © 2021 El Jisr and Lignos.",Fragility Assessment of Beam-Slab Connections for Informing Earthquake-Induced Repairs in Composite-Steel Moment Resisting Frames,2021,beam-slab connections; composite action; composite-steel MRFs; earthquake damage assessment; fragility functions; performance-based seismic assessment; shear studs,None,0,0

Low and medium rise RC-MRFs, which constitute approximately 80-90% of the total buildings stock in Iran, are focused in this fragility-based assessment. The seismic design of 3-12 story RC-MRFs are carried out according to the Iranian Code of Practice for Seismic Resistant Design of Buildings (Standard No. 2800), and the analytical models are formed accordingly in open source nonlinear platforms. Frame structures are categorized in three subclasses according to the specific characteristics of construction practice and the observed seismic performance after major earthquakes in Iran. Both far and near fields' ground motions have been considered in the fragility estimation. An optimal intensity measure (IM) called Sa, avg and beta probability distribution were used to obtain reliable fragility-based database for earthquake damage and loss estimation of RC buildings stock in urban areas of Iran. Nonlinear incremental dynamic analyses by means of lumped-parameter based structural models have been simulated and performed to extract the fragility curves. Approximate confidence bounds are developed to represent the epistemic uncertainties inherent in the fragility estimations. Consequently, it's shown that including vertical ground motion in the analysis is highly recommended for reliable seismic assessment of RC buildings.

However, damage to chimneys and structural walls includes widespread types of damage that have resulted in houses being posted with yellow or red tags, restricting their postearthquake occupancy. By using analytical models, we develop fragility curves, sometimes also referred to as fragility functions, for estimating the probability of damage to masonry chimneys and severe damage to shear walls in wood-frame single-family houses as a function of the number of stories of the house, the year the chimney was built, and the ground motion intensity. Fragility curves are provided as a function of two different ground motion intensity measures: the 5%-damped average spectral pseudoacceleration at a period of 0.16 s, and the peak ground acceleration. The proposed fragility curves are used within a fully probabilistic methodology for estimating the number of wood-frame single-family houses with chimney and wall damage in Napa, California, due to the 2014 South Napa earthquake. Results are compared to estimates computed using three previously proposed methodologies and with empirical data collected after the earthquake. The proposed fragility curves and methodology lead to estimations of the number of houses with chimney and wall damage that are between 2 and 10 times less biased than those computed using previous damage estimation procedures.

12971,"Around the world, a large percentage of buildings in regions of high seismicity are older, non-ductile reinforced concrete. To assess the risk posed by these buildings, fragility functions are required to define the likelihood that these buildings will sustain damage and collapse under earthquake loading. This paper presents the initial phase of a research effort to develop fragility functions for non-ductile concrete frames using numerical simulation; the research presented in this paper focuses on development of the numerical model and application of the model to develop fragility functions for a prototype non-ductile concrete frame. To enable numerical simulation of concrete frame buildings, response models for beam-column joints and columns are developed to provide (1) appropriate simulation of component response and, thereby, reliable assessment of risk and (2) computational efficiency and robustness. These new models are developed using existing experimental data, build on response models proposed by others, and employ component and material models available in the OpenSees analysis platform (http://opensees.berkeley.edu). A new beam-column joint model combines a new expression for joint strength and newly developed cyclic response parameters; a new column response model includes a new shear-strength model and newly developed cyclic response parameters. Numerical models of a prototype non-ductile concrete frame are developed that include simulation of one or more of the following characteristics: (1) rigid beam-column joint, (2) nonlinear joint shear response, (3) nonlinear joint shear and bond-slip response, and (4) column shear failure. Dynamic analyses are performed using these frame models and a suite of ground motions; analysis results are used to develop fragility curves.

12973,"Many of the earthworks assets on rail transport networks were constructed in the 1800s and have thus operated for periods far in excess of their expected service life. Incidences of failure - particularly shallow planar landslides - are increasing, in part due to the effect of more intense and longer duration rainfall events. Network owners have difficulty in targeting scarce resources to reduce risk across networks. This paper proposes a methodology for developing fragility curves for rainfall-induced landslides on transport networks. Fragility curves provide the probability of exceedance of different limit states for a given hazard considering a range of magnitudes. In this paper, the vulnerability of slopes as expressed by a loss of performance is quantified for rainfall events of various intensities and duration. The approach expands upon probabilistic slope stability analysis and provides a rational logical framework for considering how vulnerable a slope is to rainfall-induced failure.",Fragility curves for rainfall-induced shallow landslides on transport networks,2018,fragility curves; vulnerability; probabilistic analysis; shallow landslides; rainfall; transport,REINFORCED-CONCRETE BUILDINGS; SHEAR-STRENGTH; VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; PHYSICAL VULNERABILITY; RELIABILITY-ANALYSIS; STABILITY ANALYSIS; RISK ANALYSIS; AREA NORTH; INFILTRATION; SLOPES,0,0

12981,"Building-specific loss assessment methodologies use component fragility curves to compute expected losses in the aftermath of earthquakes. Such curves are not available for steel columns assuming they remain elastic because of capacity design considerations. Nonetheless, first-story steel columns in moment-resisting frames (MRFs) are expected to experience damage through flexural yielding and formation of geometric instabilities. This paper uses an experimental database that was recently assembled to develop two sets of univariate drift-based column fragility curves that consider the influence of loading history. Ordinal logistic regression is also employed to develop multivariate fragility curves that capture geometric and loading parameters that affect column performance. The implications of the proposed fragility curves for building-specific loss assessment are demonstrated using an eight-story office building with steel MRFs. It is shown that structural repair costs in this case may increase by 10%, regardless of seismic intensity, when column damage is considered. Similarly, the contribution of structural component repairs to expected annual losses may double over the building’s life span. © 2018, Earthquake Engineering Research Institute.",Fragility curves for wide-flange steel columns and implications for building-specific earthquake-induced loss assessment,2018,None,Earthquakes; Logistic regression; Office buildings; Repair; Steel construction; Assessment methodologies; Column performance; Expected annual loss; Experimental database; Geometric instabilities; Moment resisting frames; Ordinal logistic regression; Structural component; Structural frames; building; column; earthquake damage; hazard assessment; loading; seismic hazard; steel structure; structural analysis,0,0

12984,"A component fragility curve depicts a statistical distribution that indicates the conditional probability of incurring damage at a given value of engineering demand parameter (e.g., lateral drift, rotation etc.). Component fragility curves are used for estimating the damage state and retrofitting method of components, which form the basis of assessment of structural seismic performance and resilience. Experimental data of 74 reinforced concrete (RC) shear wall specimens and 32 RC coupling beam specimens are collected and analyzed. All selected specimens satisfy the requirements of the Chinese code for seismic design of buildings (GB 50011-2010). After defining the damage states and corresponding retrofitting methods, the fragility curves of RC walls and coupling beams are developed, respectively, using the drift ratio and beam chord rotation as the engineering demand parameter. Furthermore, the influence of design axial force ratio on the fragility curves of RC walls and that of span-to-depth ratio on the fragility curves of RC coupling beams are analyzed and discussed.

12985,"In literature the fragility curves are usually adopted to evaluate the probability of exceedance of a given damage state. This chapter presents for the first time a procedure for developing fragility curves of restoration processes which can be adopted for resilience analysis. The restoration process describes the capacity to recover from a system failure and it is one of the most uncertain variables in the resilience analysis therefore, the problem should be treated in probabilistic terms. In the chapter, a method is proposed for evaluating the Restoration Fragility Functions (RFF) of a given system following an extreme event. The restoration curves have been built empirically using the data obtained by a discrete event simulation model of the system considered. Different restoration processes obtained through Monte Carlo simulations have been analyzed statistically to determine the probability of exceedance of a given restoration state. Then, Restoration Fragility Functions (RFF) are obtained using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) approach assuming a lognormal cumulative distribution function. The method has been applied to an Emergency Department of a hospital during a crisis, because these buildings are critical facilities which should withstand after an earthquake in order to assist injuries.

12986,"Fragility curves are essential tools to quantitatively assess the physical vulnerability of structures and infrastructures at risk for a given seismic hazard. They describe the probability of exceeding a given performance level under earthquake excitation, and are usually defined by a lognormal probability distribution function. Although debris from damaged buildings adjacent to road edges is the main cause of urban mobility disruption, studies on the fragility curves development for infrastructures subject to seismic actions focus on geotechnical effects, and do not analyze this type of road blockage. The article proposes an analytical procedure to construct fragility curves for urban road networks. It is based on the construction of debris graphs and the use of an appropriate fitting technique. For a given seismic intensity measure level, the developed fragility curves express the probability that the road is open or closed to the transit of emergency vehicles after debris fall. Therefore, the performance level is defined in terms of the width of the road pavement that remains free after the debris fall, or the width of the debris heap on the road pavement. Finally, the proposed framework is tested with real data of the main street in Amatrice, and the results are presented and discussed. © 2020 by the authors.",Fragility curves of the urban road network based on the debris distributions of interfering buildings,2020,Damages buildings; Debris distribution; Emergency management; Fragility curves; Road closure probability; Seismic risk analysis; Urban road network,None,0,0
12988,"Unreinforced masonry buildings undergoing seismic actions often exhibit local failure mechanisms which represent a serious life-safety hazard, as recent strong earthquakes have shown. Compared to new buildings, older unreinforced masonry buildings are more vulnerable, not only because they have been designed without or with limited seismic loading requirements, but also because horizontal structures and connections amid the walls are not always effective. Also, Out-Of-Plane (OOP) mechanisms can be caused by significant slenderness of the walls even if connections are effective. The purpose of this paper is to derive typological fragility functions for unreinforced masonry walls considering OOP local failure mechanisms. In the case of slender walls with good material properties, the OOP response can be modeled with reference to an assembly of rigid bodies undergoing rocking motion. In particular, depending on its configuration, a wall is assumed either as a single rigid body undergoing simple one-sided rocking or a system of two coupled rigid bodies rocking along their common edge. A set of 44 ground motions from earthquake events occurred from 1972 to 2017 in Italy is used in this study. The likelihood of collapse is calculated via Multiple Stripe Analysis (MSA) from a given wall undergoing a specific ground motion. Then, the single fragility functions are suitably combined to define a typological fragility function for a class of buildings. The procedure is applied to a historical aggregate in the city center of Ferrara (Italy) as a case study. The fragility functions developed in this research can be a helpful tool for assessing seismic damage and economic losses in unreinforced masonry buildings on a regional scale.","Fragility functions for local failure mechanisms in unreinforced masonry buildings: a typological study in Ferrara, Italy",None,Unreinforced masonry buildings; Fragility functions; Out-of-plane failure; Local collapse mechanisms,SEISMIC VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; ROCKING RESPONSE; COLLAPSE MECHANISMS; DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; RIGID BLOCKS; PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR; CENTERS,0,0

12990,"Diagonally reinforced concrete coupling beams (DRCBs) act as a fuse element that dissipates most of the seismic energies imparted to coupled shear wall systems during earthquakes. The objective of this study is to develop the fragility functions of different groups of DRCBs: (1) all DRCBs, (2) DRCBs conforming to the ACI 318-14 (Building code requirements for structural concrete and commentary (ACI 318-14), American Concrete Institute, Farmington Hills, 2014) confinement options A and B, and (c) DRCBs not conforming to the ACI 318-14 confinement options. Forty-three specimens were collected from nineteen previous experimental studies to estimate their empirical fragility using four different damage states. It was found that maximum shear stress (υmax) played an important role in the fragility curves. Without considering υmax, the fragility of DRCBs was significantly underestimated for DRCBs with υmax &lt; 4.0 whereas their fragility was overestimated for DRCBs with υmax &gt; 4.0. In this study, fragility curves were constructed considering the level of υmax. Mean chord rotations (μθ) of DRCB specimens were estimated for life safety and collapse prevention limit states, and compared to corresponding limiting values specified in ASCE 41-17 (Seismic evaluation and retrofit of existing buildings, American Society of Civil Engineers, Reston, 2017. https://doi.org/10.1061/9780784414859).

12991,"Since 2008, an increase in human-induced seismic activity related to natural gas production and petroleum activities has resulted in millions of dollars of damage in the Central United States, primarily to residential buildings including chimneys and masonry veneers. This study aims to better understand and evaluate the impacts of such seismic hazards on masonry veneers. To do so, a probabilistic framework is proposed in which fragility curves representing the probability of cracking and collapse damage states for masonry veneers are developed. In the proposed framework, Artificial Neural Networks are adopted to develop probabilistic seismic demand models from experimentally-validated finite element analyses of non-seismically detailed masonry veneers. The framework utilizes a suite of 200 ground motions largely believed to be from human-induced earthquakes with magnitudes of 3.6–5.8 recorded in the Central U.S. since 2008. Fragility curves are produced for masonry veneers with code compliant corrugated brick ties and those with thinner brick ties that are commonly employed in residential construction in the Central U.S. Additionally, the proposed fragilities developed for human-induced earthquakes are compared to those from the literature, which were developed for the New Madrid seismic hazard and are commonly used for seismic vulnerability assessments of infrastructure in the Central U.S. The results indicate that for a given PGA level, induced earthquakes may be more likely to produce damage compared to earthquakes representing the New Madrid hazard. Finally, the regional extents of damage from a recent induced seismic event are estimated using the newly developed and existing fragility functions to evaluate the implications of using these models for regional vulnerability assessments. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Fragility of masonry veneers to human-induced Central U.S. earthquakes using neural network models,2020,Artificial neural network; Fragility assessment; Induce seismic hazard; Masonry veneers,Brick; Damage detection; Hazards; Housing; Natural gas; Natural gas well production; Neural networks; Seismic response; Veneers; Fragility assessment; Natural-gas production; Probabilistic framework; Probabilistic seismic demand models; Residential construction; Seismic hazards; Seismic vulnerability; Vulnerability assessments; Earthquakes,0,0
12993,"When modeling RC shear wall buildings for seismic analysis there is little consensus in the literature on the appropriate value of the wall effective shear stiffness (GAeff) and the slab effective bending stiffness (EIeff). A probabilistic analysis based on fragility curves is a robust technique to assess the influence of these parameters on the expected seismic performance, but such studies are scarce because they require computationally expensive analysis such as Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA). In this paper, fragility curves are developed following the recently introduced SPO2FRAG procedure, a simplified methodology that does not require IDA but the computationally more affordable incremental static (pushover) analysis. The fragility curves provided by SPO2FRAG are used to evaluate the influence of the values of GAeff and EIeff on the analytical seismic response of full 3D nonlinear models of two actual (and representative) residential wall buildings of 17 and 26 stories located in Santiago (Chile).

12995,"A framework is presented for incorporating probabilistic building performance limit states in the assessment of community resilience to earthquakes. The limit states are defined on the basis of their implications to postearthquake functionality and recovery. They include damage triggering inspection, occupiable damage with loss of functionality, unoccupiable damage, irreparable damage, and collapse. Fragility curves are developed linking earthquake ground motion intensity to the probability of exceedance for each of the limit states. A characteristic recovery path is defined for each limit state on the basis of discrete functioning states, the time spent within each state, and the level of functionality associated with each state. A building recovery function is computed accounting for the uncertainty in the occurrence of each recovery path and its associated limit state. The outcome is a probabilistic assessment of recovery of functionality at the building level for a given ground motion intensity. The effects of externalities and other socioeconomic factors on building-level recovery and ways to incorporate these in the framework are discussed.

12996,"Earthquakes are one of the most destructive natural disasters with devastating consequences on people and their supporting infrastructure. To alleviate the earthquake consequences, the recovery process of building systems, essential for providing continued operation, should be considered during the design of the building. This study presents a novel, probabilistic, building-level framework for modeling and evaluating the entire recovery process, expressed by duration and path of functional recovery. The proposed framework consists of three novel and integrated models for evaluation building's 1) post-earthquake functionality, 2) mobilization time, and 3) repair time. It is in line with the probabilistic PBEE methodology, and it utilizes FEMA P-58 damage assessment results to evaluate the recovery process. With a modular structure, it allows easy extension and addition of new framework components. The unique feature of the framework is its capability to generate a functional recovery curve and isolate 1) the contributors to the interrupted building operation and 2) building components that dominate the recovery process.

12998,"Current seismic design codes and damage estimation tools neglect the influence of successive events on structures. However, recent earthquakes have demonstrated that structures damaged during an initial event (mainshock) are more vulnerable to severe damage and collapse during a subsequent event (aftershock). This increased vulnerability to damage translates to increased likelihood of loss of use, property, and life. Thus, a reliable risk assessment tool is required that characterizes the risk of the undamaged structure subjected to an initial event and the risk of the damaged structure under subsequent events. In this paper, a framework for development of aftershock fragilities is presented; these aftershock fragilities define the likelihood that a building damaged during a mainshock will exhibit a given damage state following one or more aftershocks. Thus, the framework provides a method for characterizing the risk associated with damage accumulation in the structure. The framework includes the following: (i) creation of a numerical model of the structure; (ii) characterization of building damage states; (iii) generation of a suite of mainshock-aftershocks; (iv) mainshock-aftershock analyses; and (v) development of aftershock fragility curves using probabilistic aftershock demand models, defined as a linear regression of aftershock demand-intensity pairs in a logarithmic space, and damage-state prediction models. The framework is not limited to a specific structure type but requires numerical models defining structural response and linking structural response with damage. In the current study, non-ductile RC frames (low-rise, mid-rise, and high-rise) are selected as case studies for the application of the framework.

One of the main concerns of this work was to obtain a useful outcome for the actual improvement of tsunami risk management in Oman. This goal was achieved through the development of comprehensive and functional management tools such as the Tsunami Hazard, Vulnerability and Risk Atlas and the Risk Reduction Measures Handbook, which will help to design and plan a roadmap towards risk reduction. The integrated tsunami risk assessment performed showed that the northern area of Oman would be the most affected, considering both the hazard and vulnerability components. This area also concentrates nearly 50% of the hot spots identified throughout the country, 70% of them are located in areas with a very high risk class, in which risk reduction measures were selected and prioritized.",From tsunami risk assessment to disaster risk reduction - the case of Oman,2018,None,MAKRAN SUBDUCTION ZONE; FRAGILITY CURVES; HAZARD ASSESSMENT; VULNERABILITY; BUILDINGS; STABILITY; FRAMEWORK; PAKISTAN; COASTS,0,0
13001,"A full polarimetric ground-based SAR system for subsurface damage assessment of wooden building structures has been developed. The system is based on a 4-channel VNA connected to a polarimetric antenna array. The array elements consist of 4 newly developed circular polarization cavity-backed spiral antennas, which have very good wideband characteristics and excellent polarimetric performance. By 2 dimensional scanning the system can achieve polarimetric 3D imaging with super high-resolution of 1 cm in x-/y-direction and 2 cm in z-direction. Using the polarimetric phase information, deformations of internal wooden structures like beams and bars with inclination angles <1 deg. can be detected, which is not possible with any other non-destructive testing technique. © 2015 IEEE.",Full polarimetric UWB GB-SAR for damage assessment of wooden building structures,2015,calibration; disaster mitigation; non-destructive testing; radar polarimetry; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR),None,0,0
13002,"This paper presents the use of modern survey techniques, particularly light detection and ranging (LiDAR) scanning, to collect time-sensitive information before and after shake table experiments. Two full-scale, three-story residential buildings were tested simultaneously on the largest shake table in the world. The focus of this study is on the use of LiDAR to document observations during these tests. The challenges experienced during this study prompted the development of a formalized survey procedure using LiDAR scanning techniques, which can be used by other researchers when planning to collect such time-sensitive data from similar experimental programs. In this paper, damage assessment through visual inspection, which is commonly performed during full-scale tests, is compared to postexperiment assessments using postprocessed LiDAR-derived point clouds. Various examples of damage to structural and nonstructural components, including columns, bracing, partition walls, and facades, are illustrated through postshaking visual inspections as well as LiDAR-derived point clouds. The feasibility of making accurate measurements using LiDAR point clouds, and automatically detecting damage using the point-to-point cloud comparison, is presented. Finally, the relationship between observations through traditional instruments (e.g., accelerometers and laser meters) and LiDAR is discussed. In one example, the measurements from eight laser meters around the buildings are used to validate the measurements obtained using LiDAR point clouds. It is concluded that observations through LiDAR are complementary to those from traditional instruments, while permanent/residual displacements after the tests can be measured from both traditional and modern instruments.

13003,"Devastating earthquakes are one of the most serious natural disasters that affect mankind. Although humans cannot predict or prevent earthquakes, we can change the way we respond to them. Earthquake-induced building damage is one of the main causes of casualties and property loss. Extracting the information of post-earthquake buildings quickly and accurately is crucial for identifying earthquake-induced building damage and initiating effective rescue of survivors. The geographical environment is complex in the seismic field, and remote sensing technology is a potential alternative to capturing post-event scene data. Numerous studies have focused on researching intact buildings. The identification of building seismic damage based on airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is studied only by using object-oriented analysis, and few papers use the characteristics of building points. This paper proposes a method that extracts building points in the earthquake zone from airborne LiDAR point cloud data. This paper treats the fast and reliable extraction of the information of a post-earthquake building as a challenging task in which many difficulties arise because of airborne LiDAR point cloud data, and pre-existing methods cannot easily achieve the desired effect. Therefore, this paper presents a method that combines aerial images and LiDAR data to extract post-event building points in the affected quake areas. The approach consists of several steps. We first extract terrain points from the LiDAR point cloud by using the cloth simulation filtering algorithm, and off-terrain points are removed. Then, we manually collect training samples of building and vegetation points and identify the red band as the best spectral characteristic information to maintain two isolated points. This procedure is based on the minimum probability of total error. Afterwards, we assign the gray value of the aerial image red band to the terrain points (which mainly include buildings, vegetation, pedestrians, and vehicle). The vegetation points are eliminated from off-terrain points by using gray-level histogram threshold segmentation. We used the density-based spatial clustering of applications with the noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to extract the final building points from the rest of the laser footprints, which contain discrete noise points. We can obtain intact and destructive building points from the LiDAR point cloud by using techniques such as point cloud filtering and threshold segmentation based on the gray intensity of the red band. However, some low-density noise points on the road, such as vehicles, pedestrians, and vegetation, can be obtained. The high-density building points remain nearly constant, and discrete low-density noise points are removed effectively by using the DBSCAN algorithm. The extracted point cloud of a building is compared with reference points to quantitatively verify the extraction accuracy. The false-dismissal probability and false-alarm probability are 15.61% and 7.52%, respectively. The two main causes of undetected error are as follows: (1) The damaged building points, which have a similar height as the ground points, are filtered when the point cloud filter is executed. (2) The building points in the shadow of tall buildings or trees are divided into vegetation points during threshold segmentation. False-alarm error is due to crowded vehicle points in local areas, and these points cannot be removed by using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm. The two errors are small, and the total extraction accuracy is as high as 84.39%, thereby indicating that the extraction of building points in quake-hit regions satisfies requirements in some bounds of precision with the application of the aforementioned method. Results show that the suggested method can effectively extract building points in the earthquake zone within a certain accuracy requirement and provide technical reference for the extraction of post-earthquake intact or destroyed buildings by using airborne LiDAR point cloud data. The proposed approach could establish the foundation for identifying seismic building disasters and completing post-earthquake building damage assessment. With the development of laser radar technology, an airborne LiDAR remote sensing system can receive dense point cloud data while acquiring multispectral or hyperspectral data. Hence, we will improve the ability of the proposed approach to distinguish between vegetation and buildings by using threshold segmentation based on normalized difference vegetation index or other band combinations to further improve the accuracy of building point extraction in the seismic field. © 2018, Science Press.

13004,"Building extraction from remote sensing images is very important in many fields, such as urban planning, land use investigation, damage assessment, and so on. In polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) imagery, the buildings not only have typical polarimetric features but also have rich texture features. In this paper, the texture information is introduced to improve the accuracy of urban building extraction from PolSAR imagery by a new method called cross reclassification. Based on this method, the polarimetric information-based results and texture-based results can be effectively fused. The experimental results of three representative PolSAR images with different characteristics demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the accuracy of building extraction can be improved, compared with the traditional method using only polarimetric information.",Fusion of polarimetric and texture information for urban building extraction from fully polarimetric SAR imagery,2016,None,ADAPTIVE NUMBER; CLASSIFICATION,0,0
13005,"Seismic activities are serious disasters that induce natural hazards resulting in an incalculable amount of damage to properties and millions of deaths. Typically, seismic risk assessment can be performed by means of structural damage information computed based on the maximum displacement of the structure. In this study, machine learning models based on GPR are developed in order to estimate the maximum displacement of the structures from seismic activities and then used to construct fragility curves as an application. During construction of the models, 13 features of seismic waves are considered, and six wave features are selected to establish the seismic models with the correlation analysis normalizing the variables with the peak ground acceleration. Two models for six-floor and 13-floor buildings are developed, and a sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the relationship between prediction accuracy and sampling size. A 10-fold cross-validation method is used to evaluate the model performance, using the R-squared, root mean squared error, Nash criterion, and mean bias. Results of the six-parameter-based model apparently indicate a similar performance to that of the 13-parameter-based model for the two types of buildings. The model for the six-floor building affords a steadily enhanced performance by increasing the sampling size, while the model for the 13-floor building shows a significantly improved performance with a sampling size of over 200. The results indicate that the heighted structure requires a larger sampling size because it has more degrees of freedom that can influence the model performance. Finally, the proposed models are successfully constructed to estimate the maximum displacement, and applied to obtain fragility curves with various performance levels. Then, the regional seismic damage is assessed in Gyeonjgu city of South Korea as an application of the developed models. The damage assessment with the fragility curve provides the structural response from the seismic activities, which can assist in minimizing damage. © 2021 by the authors.

Three hospital buildings with varying heights of 3-5 stories are selected, and a set of fragility curves are generated for each class. The major parameters considered in this study are the number of stories, lateral stiffness, strength, and displacement capacities of the selected template designs. A large number of pushover and time history analyses are deployed under a set of 100 strong ground motion records. Fragility curves are generated based on the analysis results for each of the typical buildings. Peak ground velocity (PGV) is selected as the measure of seismic intensity. From the generated sets of the fragility curves, it is observed that damage probabilities are significantly affected by the concrete and detailing quality. Using the constructed fragility curves, collapse probabilities of existing public buildings were estimated according to PGV values. The estimated damage by fragility analyses is compared with past studies related to RC buildings in the region. Hence, analytical fragility curves developed in this study can increase the effectiveness of seismic assessment of essential health care facilities with template designs in the Turkey region. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Generation of fragility curves for typical RC health care facilities: Emphasis on hospitals in Turkey,2016,Capacity curves; Damage estimation; Fragility-based seismic assessment; Reinforced concrete hospital buildings; Vulnerability,Damage detection; Earthquake effects; Health care; Hospitals; Reinforced concrete; Capacity curves; Damage estimation; Hospital buildings; Seismic assessment; Vulnerability; Structural analysis,0,0

Especially, detailed tsunami hazard assessments were performed in many areas using fine bathymetry and topography data all over Japan including hazards from the worst case tsunamigenic earthquakes provided by central government and local governments in Hokkaido, Japan Sea and Nankai Trough. These results from the detailed hazard and vulnerability assessment were used for detailed tsunami risk in Japan. The Willis's Japan tsunami model was then first released in December 2014.

13009,"The identification of changes in urban settlements is of great interest for damage assessment after natural disasters, cadastral mapping and monitoring urban development and illegal activities. Radar-based remote sensing from space-borne platforms is quite useful in this scenario and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is attractive due to its wide coverage, the day and night all-weather availability, and the sensitivity to slight changes in the scene structure. In this context, the launch of the European Space Agency (ESA) constellation Sentinel-1 has played a significant role: the exact repetition of the acquisition geometry, the repeated illumination and the sensitivity to centimetric changes thanks to the C-Band (5.4GHz) radar payload make Sentinel-1 the perfect instrument to monitor urban settlements. Coherent Change Detection (CCD) techniques are able to detect even the finest change in the structure of a target, so small to be comparable with the wavelength. This sensibility is an advantage, but turns into a drawback especially in an urban environment where every subtle change may cause an unwanted detection. This paper tackles the problem of the huge amount of triggered detections over urbanized areas with a combination of a high-resolution coherent multi-change detection technique and Geospatial Information System (GIS) post-processing. The final result is a map of buildings that are changed in the scene due to relevant variation of their structure. In this contribution, the complete workflow is explained, and a preliminary validation is carried out by means of a set of images gathered by Sentinel-1 and a set of optical images over the city of Manchester. . © 2020 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.",High-resolution SAR coherent change detection in urban environment,2020,Change detection; GIS; high-resolution; radar; SAR; urban,Damage detection; Disasters; Geometrical optics; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Space platforms; Synthetic aperture radar; Urban growth; Acquisition geometry; Coherent change detection; Damage assessments; European Space Agency; Geo-spatial information systems; High-resolution SAR; Illegal activities; Radar based remote sensing; Space-based radar,0,0
13010,"Himalayan region is seismically one of the most active continental regions. It experienced at least 4 M similar to 8 earthquakes during an active phase from 1897 to 1952. However, no such earthquake has occurred since 1952. Detailed investigations have revealed that the region is currently in a seismic quiescence phase, and enough strains have been accumulated to source several M similar to 8 earthquakes. However, when and where such an earthquake would occur cannot be forecasted. Even if such an earthquake is forecasted to occur, can everyone leave to a safe place? That is not practical. It is therefore important to learn to live with earthquakes and develop an earthquake resilient society. Recent earthquakes have demonstrated the effectiveness of such an approach. One very effective way to develop earthquake resilient society is to create an earthquake scenario for the repeat of an earlier earthquake, estimate the losses, and then go through an exercise of imparting and sharing with public, state and central governance the ways and means of reducing the anticipated losses. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Government of India, in collaboration with other agencies, built earthquake scenarios for the repeat of the 1905 Kangra earthquake of M similar to 8 and 1897 Shillong earthquake of M 8.7. Appropriate ground motion prediction equation was used to generate earthquake intensities. The intensities of the hypothetical Mw 8 earthquake located at Mandi in Himachal Pradesh (close to the epicenter of 1905 Kangra earthquake) were compared with the 1905 Kangra earthquake's isoseismals and found to be satisfactory. For the 1897 Shillong earthquake, the isoseismals drawn by experts for the 1897 earthquake were used. Using the 2011 Census data for demography and building typology, it was estimated that if the hypothetical Mandi earthquake occurs in the middle of the night, the human lives lost would be similar to 959100 combining the states of Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and the Union Territory of Chandigarh. It may be noted that the 1905 earthquake had claimed similar to 20,000 human lives. For the repeat of Shillong M 8.7 earthquake in the mid of the night, the number of lives lost estimated would be similar to 423000 in the 8 north-east states (Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Sikkim, Nagaland, Manipur, Tripura and Mizoram). NDMA took up detailed preparatory exercises involving the center and state bodies for Rapid Visual Screening (RVS) of lifeline buildings; school sensitization events; Incident Response System (IRS); and Awareness Generation programs involving local celebrities and a variety of news media. National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force(s) (SDRF) played a crucial role. To test the preparedness, mega-mock drills were held on 13 February 2013 for the 3 north-western states and UT Chandigarh; and on 10 and 13 March 2014 for the 8 north-eastern states. Performances of all the sectors were evaluated by independent observers. There was an excellent media coverage and the very purpose of generating awareness of the losses due to foreseeable earthquakes and how to reduce them was amply demonstrated. It is important to conduct similar exercises in other regions falling under Seismic Zones V and IV of the country.

13011,"As demonstrated by recent tropical cyclone events, including U.S. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria (2017), and Florence (2018), the destructive potential of flooding driven by wind, precipitation, and coastal surge coupled with growing exposure of people and property along coastlines is leading to unprecedented damage from coastal storms. In this paper, we demonstrate the ability of the recently developed Super-Fast INundation of CoastS (SFINCS) model to delineate the depth and extent of flooding during Hurricane Harvey in Houston, Texas. The model was validated against water level time-series at twenty-one United States Geological Survey (USGS) observation points and 115 high water mark locations. FEMA depth-damage curves were used to estimate building and content damages from the combined flood sources (e.g., pluvial, fluvial, and marine) and total losses are compared against insurance claims registered with the U.S. National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and a depth grid produced during the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Preliminary Damage Assessment (PDA). The results suggest that Harvey may have caused upwards of $8.3 billion USD in uninsured residential loss within the model domain. Comparison against FEMA’s PDA indicates that the SFINCS model predicts much larger total losses, indicating that the incorporation of spatially-distributed pluvial hazards into the modeling method is critical for identifying high-risk areas and supports the need for further flood risk analyses in the region. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Hindcast of pluvial, fluvial, and coastal flood damage in Houston, Texas during Hurricane Harvey (2017) using SFINCS",2021,Hydrodynamic modeling; Pluvial flooding; Risk assessment; Storm surge; Tropical cyclone,None,0,0
13012,"Resiliency of communities prone to natural hazards can be enhanced through the use of risk-informed decision-making tools. These tools can provide community decision makers key information, thereby providing them the ability to consider an array of mitigation and/or recovery strategies. The Center for Risk-Based Community Resilience Planning, headquartered at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado, developed an Interdependent Networked Community Resilience (IN-CORE) computational environment. The purpose of developing this computational environment is to build a decision-support system, for professional risk planners and emergency responders, but even more focused on allowing researchers to explore community resilience science. The eventual goal was being to integrate a broad range of scientific, engineering and observational data to produce a detailed assessment of the potential impact of natural and man-made hazards for risk mitigation, planning and recovery purposes. The developing computational environment will be capable of simulating the effects from different natural hazards on the physical and socioeconomic sectors of a community, accounting for interdependencies between the sectors. However, in order to validate this computational tool, hindcasting of a real event was deemed necessary. Therefore, in this study, the community of Joplin, Missouri in the USA, which was hit by an EF-5 tornado on May 22, 2011, is modeled in the IN-CORE v1.0 computational environment. An explanation of the algorithm used within IN-CORE is also provided. This tornado was the costliest and deadliest single tornado in the USA in the last half century. Using IN-CORE, by uploading a detailed topological dataset of the community and the estimated tornado path combined with recently developed physics-based tornado fragilities, the damage caused by the tornado to all buildings in the city of Joplin was estimated. The results were compared with the damage reported from field studies following the event. This damage assessment was done using three hypothetical idealized tornado scenarios, and results show very good correlation with observed damage which will provide useful information to decision makers for community resilience planning. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Hindcasting community-level building damage for the 2011 Joplin EF5 tornado,2018,Community damage assessment; Joplin tornado; Resolution; Tornado fragilities,community response; decision making; decision support system; hazard assessment; hindcasting; risk assessment; storm damage; tornado; weather forecasting; Joplin; Missouri; United States,0,0
13013,"Tornados are common natural hazards that occur in the United States and result in social and economic loss. Resiliency of communities prone to tornadoes can be enhanced through the use of risk-informed decision-making tools. These tools can provide community decision-makers with key information, thereby allowing them the ability to consider an array of mitigation and/or recovery strategies of relevant sectors in a community, including physical infrastructure, social and economic sectors. This study focuses on the community of Joplin, Missouri, which was struck by an EF-5 tornado on May 22, 2011. This tornado was the costliest and deadliest single tornado in the United States in the last 50years. Initially, the damage caused by the tornado to the Electric Power Network (EPN) of the city is assessed by using a detailed topological data set obtained from the electric power company, combined with a spatial wind speed model and component fragilities. Many factors including the type of the electric poles, age, city growth rate, and so forth, were considered in this assessment. The results were compared with the damage reported from field studies following the event. Using the predicted damages to the poles, probabilities of power loss for each individual building in the city were calculated. A weighted cellular automata (CA) technique was used to estimate the service area of substations and the path that the electric power must travel to arrive at demand nodes. In addition, the effects of damage to the electric substations and transmission lines were considered. The results were compared with power loss reported by home and business owners to the electric power company. Combining the power loss probabilities with the probabilities of damage to buildings in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) format, combined EPN-building probabilities of damage are presented. Such information can be used by decision makers for community resilience planning, and improvement.","Hindcasting Community-Level Damage to the Interdependent Buildings and Electric Power Network after the 2011 Joplin, Missouri, Tornado",2019,Electric power network; Joplin tornado; Cellular automata; Community damage assessment; Power loss,RISK-ASSESSMENT; FRAGILITY; WIND,0,0
13014,"Historical masonry aggregates represent a large portion of the cultural heritage in Italy and are highly vulnerable to seismic actions, as shown by past seismic events. Typically, they are large and complex structures for which there is a lack of knowledge and information concerning the structural behavior, in particular as far as the response to seismic actions is concerned. This paper investigates the seismic response of two complex historical masonry aggregates located in Sora (Lazio region, Central Italy), through advanced 3D FE numerical simulations. For each aggregate, a detailed 3D FE model is developed and analyzed in the non-linear dynamic range, assuming that masonry behaves as a damaging-plastic material with almost vanishing tensile strength. The seismic performance of the two aggregates is evaluated in terms of damage distribution, energy density dissipated by tensile damage and maximum normalized displacements. The numerical analyses show the high vulnerability of the perimeter walls. In particular, the units at the extremities of the aggregate are subjected to large displacements, being not efficiently braced by the adjacent units and being subjected to the torsional effects induced by the seismic action. The presence of several openings is a fundamental feature that significantly decreases the strength of the perimeter walls, influencing the damage distribution in the aggregate mainly due to out-of-plane actions. The most damaged elements are generally the walls of the tall units without lateral support and the adjacent slabs covering large spans. Numerical results also show that the structural response of a single building unit is affected by the interactions with adjacent structural parts. Moreover, it can be stated that a preliminary structural assessment through kinematic limit analysis on partial failure mechanisms may be reliable only after a proper estimation of the different structural elements playing a role in the horizontal behavior (e.g. interlocking between walls, typology of masonry, distribution of horizontal loads, constraints and dead loads distribution, etc.). The obtained results will be also used in an accompanying paper to benchmark simplified approaches that can be employed by engineers in common design practice to quickly predict the seismic vulnerability of masonry aggregates and define the most suitable strengthening interventions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Historical masonry building aggregates: advanced numerical insight for an effective seismic assessment on two row housing compounds,2019,Masonry aggregate; Damage assessment; Full 3D FE models; Non-linear dynamic analysis; Seismic response,3D modeling; Aggregates; Damage detection; Masonry materials; Seismic design; Seismic response; Tensile strength; Walls (structural partitions); 3-D FE models; Damage assessments; Historical masonry aggregates; Information concerning; Large and complex structures; Masonry aggregates; Non-linear dynamic analysis; Normalized displacements; Failure (mechanical); aggregate; damage mechanics; dynamic analysis; finite element method; historic building; masonry; seismic response; structural response; three-dimensional modeling; Italy; Lazio; Porzana,0,0

The main advantage of P-Alert is that it is a relatively low-cost seismometer. On the other hand, due to the high price of commercial hardware of structural health monitoring (SHM) systems, the application of SHM to buildings is limited. In order to understand the performance of post-earthquake building safety evaluation of buildings using P-Alert, a series of steel frames shaking table tests with incremental damage extent are conducted. The fragility curves of different damage levels and inter-story drift ratios calculated by measured acceleration of each story using double integration and filter are used to estimate possibility of damage levels. It is concluded that acceptable detection of damage existence of the whole building is possible.

This paper investigates the possibility of combining UFREIs and shape memory alloy (SMA) wires to increase the energy dissipation capacity of the isolation system for the seismic protection of a historical masonry church. Detailed 3D finite element (FE) analyses are performed to characterize the response of UFREIs under cyclic displacements. The behavior of SMA is simulated through a thermomechanical constitutive model implemented in a user-defined material (UMAT) subroutine available in the software package Abaqus. To reduce the computational effort in non-linear dynamic analyses of large isolated structures, an Abaqus user element (UEL) is developed to represent the 3D behavior of the isolation system proposed in this study. Non-linear dynamic time history analyses are then carried out to evaluate the seismic response of a historical masonry church in different configurations (fixed-base model and model equipped with different base isolation systems) for moderate and severe seismic intensity levels. Numerical results show that the damage observed in the masonry church can be considerably reduced through the insertion of UFREIs.

13018,"Accurate assessment of building damage is very important for disaster response and rescue. Traditional damage detection techniques using 2D features at a single observing angle cannot objectively and accurately reflect the structural damage conditions. With the development of unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetric techniques and 3D point processing, automatic and accurate damage detection for building roof and facade has become a research hotspot in recent work. In this paper, we propose a building damage detection framework based on the boundary refined supervoxel segmentation and random forest–latent Dirichlet allocation classification. First, the traditional supervoxel segmentation method is improved to segment the point clouds into good boundary refined supervoxels. Then, non-building points such as ground and vegetation are removed from the generated supervoxels. Next, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model is used to construct the high-level feature representation for each building supervoxel based on the selected 2D image and 3D point features. Finally, LDA model and random forest algorithm are employed to identify the damaged building regions. This method is applied to oblique photogrammetric point clouds collected from the Beichuan Country Earthquake Site. The research achieves the 3D damage assessment for building facade and roof. The result demonstrates that the proposed framework is capable of achieving around 94% accuracy for building point extraction and around 90% accuracy for damage identification. Moreover, both of the precision and recall for building damage detection reached around 89%. Concluded from comparison analysis, the proposed method improved the damage detection accuracy and the highest improvement ratio is over 8%. © 2020 by the authors.

13019,"Point clouds generated from airborne oblique images have become a suitable source for detailed building damage assessment after a disaster event, since they provide the essential geometric and radiometric features of both roof and façades of the building. However, they often contain gaps that result either from physical damage or from a range of image artefacts or data acquisition conditions. A clear understanding of those reasons, and accurate classification of gap-type, are critical for 3D geometry-based damage assessment. In this study, a methodology was developed to delineate buildings from a point cloud and classify the present gaps. The building delineation process was carried out by identifying and merging the roof segments of single buildings from the pre-segmented 3D point cloud. This approach detected 96% of the buildings from a point cloud generated using airborne oblique images. The gap detection and classification methods were tested using two other data sets obtained with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images with a ground resolution of around 1-2. cm. The methods detected all significant gaps and correctly identified the gaps due to damage. The gaps due to damage were identified based on the surrounding damage pattern, applying Gabor wavelets and a histogram of gradient orientation features. Two learning algorithms - SVM and Random Forests were tested for mapping the damaged regions based on radiometric descriptors. The learning model based on Gabor features with Random Forests performed best, identifying 95% of the damaged regions. The generalization performance of the supervised model, however, was less successful: quality measures decreased by around 15-30%. © 2015 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

13020,"Inter-story drift displacement data can provide useful information for story damage assessment. The authors' research group has developed photonic-based sensors for the direct measurement of inter-story drift displacements. This paper proposes a scheme for evaluating the degree of damage in a building structure based on drift displacement sensing. The scheme requires only measured inter-story drift displacements without any additional finite element analysis. A method for estimating yield drift deformation is proposed, and then, the degree of beam end damage is evaluated based on the plastic deformation ratios derived with the yield drift deformation values estimated by the proposed method. The validity and effectiveness of the presented scheme are demonstrated via experimental data from a large-scale shaking table test of a one-third-scale model of an 18-story steel building structure conducted at E-Defense.

13021,"Flood damage estimation is a core task in flood risk assessments and requires reliable flood loss models. Identifying the driving factors of flood loss at residential buildings and gaining insight into their relations is important to improve our understanding of flood damage processes. For that purpose, we learn probabilistic graphical models, which capture and illustrate (in-)dependencies between the considered variables. The models are learned based on postevent surveys with flood-affected residents after six flood events, which occurred in Germany between 2002 and 2013. Besides the sustained building damage, the survey data contain information about flooding parameters, early warning and emergency measures, property-level mitigation measures and preparedness, socioeconomic characteristics of the household, and building characteristics. The analysis considers the entire data set with a total of 4,468 cases as well as subsets of the data set partitioned into single flood events and flood types: river floods, levee breaches, surface water flooding, and groundwater floods, to reveal differences in the damaging processes. The learned networks suggest that the flood loss ratio of residential buildings is directly influenced by hydrological and hydraulic aspects as well as by building characteristics and property-level mitigation measures. The study demonstrates also that for different flood events and process types the building damage is influenced by varying factors. This suggests that flood damage models need to be capable of reproducing these differences for spatial and temporal model transfers.",Identifying Driving Factors in Flood-Damaging Processes Using Graphical Models,2018,flood loss; Bayesian Network; Markov Blanket; vulnerability; Germany,LEARNING BAYESIAN NETWORKS; FEATURE-SELECTION; JUNE 2013; GERMANY; TRANSFERABILITY; INSIGHTS; LOSSES,0,0
13022,"Seismic design practices and seismic response analyses of civil structures and nuclear power plants (NPPs) have conventionally used the peak ground acceleration (PGA) or spectral acceleration (Sa) as an intensity measure (IM) of an earthquake. However, there are many other earthquake IMs that were proposed by various researchers. The aim of this study is to investigate the correlation between seismic responses of NPP components and 23 earthquake IMs and identify the best IMs for correlating with damage of NPP structures. Particularly, low- and high-frequency ground motion records are separately accounted in correlation analyses. An advanced power reactor NPP in Korea, APR1400, is selected for numerical analyses where containment and auxiliary buildings are modeled using SAP2000. Floor displacements and accelerations are monitored for the non- and base-isolated NPP structures while shear deformations of the base isolator are additionally monitored for the base-isolated NPP. A series of Pearson's correlation coefficients are calculated to recognize the correlation between each of the 23 earthquake IMs and responses of NPP structures. The numerical results demonstrate that there is a significant difference in the correlation between earthquake IMs and seismic responses of non-isolated NPP structures considering low- and high-frequency ground motion groups. Meanwhile, a trivial discrepancy of the correlation is observed in the case of the base-isolated NPP subjected to the two groups of ground motions. Moreover, a selection of PGA or Sa for seismic response analyses of NPP structures in the high-frequency seismic regions may not be the best option. Additionally, a set of fragility curves are thereafter developed for the base-isolated NPP based on the shear deformation of lead rubber bearing (LRB) with respect to the strongly correlated IMs. The results reveal that the probability of damage to the structure is higher for low-frequency earthquakes compared with that of high-frequency ground motions. © 2019",Identifying significant earthquake intensity measures for evaluating seismic damage and fragility of nuclear power plant structures,2020,Earthquake intensity measure; High-frequency ground motion; Nuclear power plant; Pearson's correlation coefficient; Seismic fragility curve,None,0,0
13023,"Building damage assessment is important in disaster emergency monitoring. In recent years, with the increase of multi-polarization capability of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) provides more possibilities for building damage assessment, and the polarization-characteristic-based building damage assessment method has gradually become the focus of research. However, because of the limitations of data acquisition in PolSAR, current research mainly focuses on the L, C, X, and other limited bands. To obtain an in depth understanding of the polarization characteristics of damaged buildings in SAR images and develop the application of the polarization characteristics of damaged buildings to other bands, this study conducted a simulation experiment of Ku band polarized SAR of buildings, and performed damage assessment feature analysis using the SAR image polarization decomposition method. In this study, a scale model of real materials was built and the “microwave characteristic measurement and simulation imaging scientific experiment platform” was used to conduct SAR simulation imaging of the target buildings. The Ku band polarized SAR images before and after building damage were obtained. Then, the polarization scattering characteristics of buildings before and after damage were analyzed using various common polarization decomposition methods such as H/A/α decomposition, Yamaguchi decomposition and Touzi decomposition. Results show that the disoriented volume scattering component and the proportion of the disoriented secondary scattering component obtained by the Yamaguchi decomposition and the αs1 component obtained by the Touzi decomposition have good indicative significance for building damage assessment in the Ku band. Compared with the X band measurement results, the Ku band is more sensitive to building damage assessment, which has important implications for future radar remote sensing applications. © 2020 Institute of Electronics Chinese Academy of Sciences.

13024,"Reinforced concrete damage over time can cause severe structural problems (e.g. Morandi Bridge in Italy [1]). Many factors contribute to concrete deterioration (Thermal conditions, chemical attacks, shrinkage, creep, carbonatation, corrosion, etc.) [2]. Reinforced concrete deterioration starts at early-age and continues with structure aging. Early-age shrinkage, creep and thermal conditions or initial cracks can have a significant impact on the dynamic behavior of concrete structures. As shown in [3], the natural frequency of a beam subjected to early-age restrained shrinkage is highly affected. In order to quantify the impact of early-age concrete damage on the dynamic behavior of structures, the GEOMAS Lab at INSA Lyon is working on a research project combining both numerical modeling and pseudo-dynamic tests on two groups of reinforced concrete portal frames. The first group is a reference group kept in endogenous conditions during its early age period in a way to limit drying effects leading to cracks while the second group is kept in non-endogenous conditions similar to construction site conditions, which induces damage. The present paper focuses on the enhanced multifiber beam model developed for the portal frames and that allows describing their behavior when subjected to a seismic loading while taking into account their initial damage due to early age effects. Future papers will deal with experimental results obtained using the pseudo-dynamic technique. In the numerical model developed, concrete shrinkage and thermal deformation are calculated independently using a THC 3D model [4], while creep is described by a series of three Kelving-Voigt models [5] and calculated using strain superposition in series with concrete µ Damage model [3]. Then values are implemented into a multifiber finite element model. Damage evolution of the RC structures over time is followed using the numerical model during 28 days and then their dynamic response when subjected to a seismic event is simulated numerically. © 2019 The authors.",Impact of early age damage on the seismic response of reinforced concrete structures,2019,Concrete; Damage; Early age; Earthquake; Pseudo-dynamic; Vulnerabiliy,3D modeling; Computational methods; Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Concretes; Corrosion; Creep; Deterioration; Earthquake engineering; Earthquakes; Engineering geology; Numerical models; Seismology; Shrinkage; Structural dynamics; Concrete deterioration; Damage; Early age; Early age shrinkages; Pseudo-dynamic techniques; Pseudo-dynamic tests; Pseudo-dynamics; Vulnerabiliy; Reinforced concrete,0,0
13025,"Seismic fragility of steel-sheathed cold-formed steel-framed (CFSF) structures is scarcely investigated; thus, the information for estimation of seismic losses of the steel-sheathed CFSF buildings is insuficient. This study aims to investigate the seismic fragility of steel-sheathed CFSF buildings with different wall configurations. Analytic models for four 2-story steel-sheathed CFSF buildings are established based on shaking table tests on steel-sheathed CFS walls. Then, a group of fragility curves for these buildings are generated. The results show that the thickness of steel sheathing and the fastener spacing of the wall have significant impact on seismic fragility of steel-sheathed CFSF buildings. The seismic fragility of the CFSF building can be reduced by increasing the thickness of steel sheathing or decreasing the fastener spacing. By increasing the thickness of steel sheathing, the reduction on probability is more obvious for the CP limit. It is also found that the exceeding probability is approximately linear with fastener spacing, with a slope in the range from 0.25%/ mm to 0.50%/mm.",Impact of Wall Configurations on Seismic Fragility of Steel-Sheathed Cold-Formed Steel-Framed Buildings,2018,None,SHEAR WALLS; BEHAVIOR; PERFORMANCE; DESIGN; SINGLE,0,0
13026,"A seismic monitoring infrastructure for relevant and strategic public buildings has been developed thanks to the agreement between the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) and Marche Region. The project was founded by European projects for the assessment of seismic risk for strategic public buildings, prevention and monitoring - European Territorial Cooperation Project Holistic (EU IPA-Adriatic) and READINESS (INTERREG Italy-Croatia). The project was born by taking advantage of the presence of MEMS accelerometers installed at the base of municipal buildings. The project aims to implement low-cost technologies and non-invasive methods to extend the seismic monitoring of the sites where the structures are located and characterize the seismic action in correspondence of them with a rapid estimate of the damage through relationships between acceleration and macroseismic intensity or fragility curves and construction features. Among the various activities, environmental seismic noise measurements were carried to investigate the fundamental vibration of the structures and soils, semi-automatic procedures were developed for the calculation of the strong motion parameters of seismic events and a web portal was implemented for the collection and rapid dissemination of information to local Civil Protection. An important part of the activities concerned the testing of new MEMS accelerometers through collaboration with the Polytechnic University of Marche (UNIVPM) and the headquarter of the Osservatorio Nazionale Terremoti (ONT) in Palermo. Moreover, new monitoring sites are being prepared in some municipalities affected by the 2016 seismic sequence. Since the beginning of the project, the strong motion parameters relating to 95 seismic events of magnitude greater than 3 and with ground motion accelerations greater than or equal to 0.001 g have been stored in the database. © 2021 Societa Geologica Italiana.

13028,"The 2011 Great East Japan Tsunami exposed many hidden weaknesses in Japan's tsunami countermeasures. Since then, many improvements have been made in both structural measures (numerical simulations, coastal defense structures, building damage assessment and control forests) and nonstructural measures (warning/observation and evacuation). This review summarizes the lessons and improvements in the five-year time period after the 2011 event. After five years, most of the lessons from the 2011 tsunami have been applied, including more realistic tsunami simulations using very fine grids, methods to strengthen coastal defense structures, building evacuations and coastal forests, improved warning content and key points to improve evacuation measures. Nevertheless, large future challenges remain, such as an advanced simulation technique and system for real-time hazard and risk prediction, implementation of coastal defense structures/multilayer countermeasures and encouraging evacuation. In addition, among papers presented at the coastal engineering conference in Japan, the proportion of tsunami-related research in Japan increased from 15% to 35% because of the 2011 tsunami, and approximately 65-70% of tsunami-related studies involve numerical simulation, coastal structures and building damage.

13029,"Community choices and actions before, during, and after a hazard event directly influence the ability of the entire community to recover once the hazard event has passed. In deciding where community developers, contractors and code officials, and homeowners/business owners can focus their collective energy to create a more resilient community, post-hazard damage assessments have shown that there is a tangible synergistic relationship among the building stock of a community exposed to certain hazard events (e.g., extreme wind events), especially pertaining to the performance of individual building envelopes. This research focuses on how implementing building codes and code-plus building strategies in hurricane-prone regions can ultimately reduce the overall damage that a ""resilient"" community must overcome. Results illustrate that there is indeed a synergistic relationship between the homes within a community primarily due to windborne debris damages incurred by the building envelope. However, the detrimental effects of this synergistic relationship can be neutralized if homes within the community adhere to current building codes while implementing additional code-plus practices that mitigate the overall damage to the community. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Improving Community Resilience to Hurricanes through Adherence to Building Codes and the Implementation of Code-Plus Practices,2017,None,Building codes; Damage detection; Hazards; Hurricanes; Solar buildings; Building envelopes; Building stocks; Community resiliences; Damage assessments; Exposed to; Extreme winds; Research focus; Windborne debris; Codes (symbols),0,0
13030,"We have developed a framework for crisis response and management that incorporates the latest technologies in computer vision (CV), inland flood prediction, damage assessment and data visualization. The framework uses data collected before, during, and after the crisis to enable rapid and informed decision making during all phases of disaster response. Our computer-vision model analyzes spaceborne and airborne imagery to detect relevant features during and after a natural disaster and creates metadata that is transformed into actionable information through web-accessible mapping tools. In particular, we have designed an ensemble of models to identify features including water, roads, buildings, and vegetation from the imagery. We have investigated techniques to bootstrap and reduce dependency on large data annotation efforts by adding use of open source labels including OpenStreetMaps and adding complementary data sources including Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) as a side channel to the network's input to encourage it to learn other features orthogonal to visual characteristics. Modeling efforts include modification of connected U-Nets for (1) semantic segmentation, (2) flood line detection, and (3) for damage assessment. In particular for the case of damage assessment, we added a second encoder to U-Net so that it could learn pre-event and post-event image features simultaneously. Through this method, the network is able to learn the difference between the pre- and post-disaster images, and therefore more effectively classify the level of damage. We have validated our approaches using publicly available data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Remote Sensing Division, which displays the city and street-level details as mosaic tile images as well as data released as part of the Xview2 challenge. In addition, we have integrated the CV-generated artifacts and results in a collection of analytic tools including routing, damage assessment, and response prioritization, to assist with response management and strategic decision. The routing tool allows users to plan optimal alternate routes given automatically detected flood lines from the latest imagery. Response prioritization estimators look for critical areas, e.g., homes surrounded by water, flooded roads, and other anomalies detected in the impacted area. Finally, the damage assessment tool includes a pixel-based financial model capable of outputting estimated financial damage costs projected according to the United States National Grid (USNG) coordinate system. In conclusion, we are working towards an emergency response system that provides stakeholders timely access to comprehensive, relevant, and reliable information.

13032,"The concept of seismic resilience is defined as the capability of a system to maintain a level of functionality or performance in the aftermath of an earthquake event. In the research reported in this paper, a methodology for the seismic resilience assessment of existing braced-frame office buildings was developed. In this context, damage levels were defined as function of performance levels associated to earthquake intensity. Furthermore, fragility curves were derived from incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) curves obtained from time-history analyses using computer software and both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties were considered. To illustrate the previously mentioned concept, a walkthrough of the methodology is presented in a case study comprising of existing 3-story and 6-story concentrically braced-frame (CBF) office buildings located in eastern Canada (Montreal and Quebec City) and western Canada (Vancouver).

13033,"Earthquake occurrence rates in some parts of the Central United States have been elevated for a number of years; this increase has been widely attributed to deep wastewater injection associated with oil and gas activities. This induced seismicity has caused damage to buildings and infrastructure and substantial public concern. In March 2016, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) published its first earthquake ground motion hazard model that accounts for the elevated seismicity, producing a one-year forecast encompassing both induced and natural earthquakes. To assess the potential impact of the elevated seismicity on buildings and the public, this paper quantifies forecasted risks of (1) building collapse and (2) the falling of nonstructural building components by combining the 2016 USGS hazard model with fragility curves for generic modern code-compliant buildings. The assessment shows significant increases in both types of risk compared to that caused by noninduced earthquakes alone; the magnitude of the increases varies from a few times to more than 100 times, depending on location, building period (which is correlated to building height), alternatives for the hazard model, and type of risk of interest.

Incremental dynamic analysis was performed on the two archetypes and a fragility curve describing the probability of collapse versus the earthquake intensity was derived for each building. Finally, the performance of the two buildings was evaluated, showing that the aluminum building performed comparably to the steel building.

The plastic damage model is adopted to represent the material failure. The finite element model is developed by using fiber beam elements for beam-columns and laminated shell elements for shear walls and slabs. Under the attack of strong seismic ground motions, the super tall structure experiences overall collapse, which is well captured by the developed finite element model.

13036,"Field reconnaissance reports reveal the seismic vulnerability of bridge abutment foundations. To reduce the time and cost of postearthquake repair, modern seismic design specifications allow abutment backwalls to fracture before the supporting abutment foundations reach their maximum strength. This design strategy enables abutment backwalls to function as a fuse, thus protecting the abutment foundations from experiencing excessive forces and damage. This paper introduces a new abutment modeling scheme to capture the shear fracture mechanism of straight backwalls in seat abutments. To this end, a backwall connection spring is developed and incorporated into a spring system that simulates the behavior of various abutment components. The importance of considering the backwall fracture is examined by reviewing conventional modeling methodologies for abutments and building companion numerical models. Static pushover and incremental dynamic analyses (IDAs) were conducted for two bridges (single- and two-span) modeled by both the proposed and conventional abutment modeling schemes. Moreover, component-level fragility curves are developed using IDA results. The comparisons show that the conventional abutment modeling schemes significantly overestimate abutment foundation damage and underestimate the likelihood of deck unseating, column damage, and bearing displacement in the passive direction. Conversely, the proposed modeling scheme is able to capture the essential seismic responses of various components in seat abutment bridges. The consideration of backwall fracture in the modeling of abutment components enables a more rational seismic response assessment of bridges with backwalls, which are likely to be damaged during earthquakes, particularly for bridges which are seismically designed to protect abutment foundations. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Influence of abutment straight backwall fracture on the seismic response of bridges,2021,backfills; backwalls; bridge abutments; finite element modeling; fracture; seismic risk analysis,Earthquakes; Foundations; Fracture; Seismic design; Seismic response; Springs (components); Abutment bridges; Bearing displacements; Component levels; Conventional modeling; Design specification; Design strategies; Incremental dynamic analysis; Seismic vulnerability; Abutments (bridge); backfill; bridge; finite element method; fracture; seismic design; seismic response,0,0
13037,"Current seismic codes and standards in practice aim at preventing collapse of structures but do not address serviceability and performance of the buildings after a major earthquake adequately. For instance, following a mainshock, ground motion activities, known as aftershocks, occur as a cluster, potentially causing incremental damage to structures whose seismic capacities may be reduced by the mainshock. This paper proposes an advanced structural modeling technique, which can simulate various features of cyclic deterioration and degradation in material and structural components using nonlinear fiber beam-column elements. The proposed model accounts for inelastic buckling and low-cycle fatigue degradation of longitudinal reinforcement, and can simulate the multiple failure modes of reinforced concrete structures under dynamic loading. Furthermore, a comprehensive ground motion selection accounting for subduction earthquakes, is implemented. Finally, a new set of fragility curves has been developed, which accounts for the structural modeling and aftershock effects.

13038,"Large earthquakes are rare natural hazards, having catastrophic impact on society due to loss of lives, damage to constructed facilities, and business interruption. Because of damage accumulation due to the main strong shaking, aftershocks potentially endanger the safety of residents and subsequently increase financial loss due to downtime and repair costs. Therefore, accurate prediction of the seismic performance of structures in the post-earthquake stage is critical for disaster risk mitigation. This paper employs an advanced structural modeling technique, which can simulate various features of cyclic degradation in material and structural components using nonlinear fiber beam-column elements. The model accounts for inelastic buckling and low-cycle fatigue degradation of longitudinal reinforcement and can simulate multiple failure modes of reinforced concrete structures under dynamic loading. Furthermore, a comprehensive ground motion selection accounting for multiple types of ground motions, such as shallow crustal, deep inslab, and subduction earthquakes, is implemented. Finally, a new set of fragility curves has been developed for each ground motion type, which accounts for the aftershock effects and influence of ground motion types on cyclic degradation and failure modes of low-rise reinforced concrete structures. It was found that slight and moderate damage is not significantly affected by major aftershocks for different ground motions types. However, considering aftershocks increases the probability of exceedance of damage for extensive and complete damage up to 5% and 10% for inslab and crustal event, respectively.

Through these case studies, the effect of the non-uniform distribution of infill walls in the building and their failure (or ?breakaway?) on building performance is considered. The building performance is characterized by a number of response parameters (i.e., first yielding, development of two hinges, and shear failure in ground floor columns). The paper shows that the in plane behaviour of exterior infill walls increases the flexural capacity and lateral stiffness of the structure, as would be expected. However, it also shows that an assumption of non-breakaway infill walls consistently leads to premature structural failure mechanisms, associated with the concentration of drag forces on seaward columns only. The results demonstrate that a good estimation of the location and occurrence of shear failure in structural elements can only be achieved by explicitly considering the out-of-plane behaviour and failure of exterior infill walls during an incremental tsunami load analysis. Finally, the Froude number assumed for the analysis is seen to strongly affect the performance of both structural and non-structural components, highlighting the importance of choosing realistic tsunami properties to perform a reliable capacity assessment.",Influence of exterior infill walls on the performance of RC frames under tsunami loads: Case study of school buildings in Sri Lanka,2021,VDPO-BI; Tsunami assessment; School resilience; Breakaway masonry infill walls; RC frames; Froude number,BEAM-COLUMN MODEL; NONLINEAR-ANALYSIS; FRAGILITY CURVES; R/C FRAMES; MASONRY; DAMAGE,0,0
13040,"The pernicious effect of far-fault and near-fault earthquake records on the seismic behavior of concrete structures has been studied widely. In addition, several research works have been carried out to investigate the influence of forward-directivity and fling‐step, as unique characteristics of the near-fault motions and not observed in the far-field, on the seismic response and damage of high-rise buildings. This paper focuses on seismic response demand and damage of building structures having different floor systems and subjected to two types of near-fault records with pulses. For this purpose, three-dimensional nonlinear finite element models were developed in ETABS. In addition, fourteen earthquake motions, with characteristics representing forward-directivity and fling-step, are selected to excite the developed models using nonlinear time-history analysis. Two damage models are employed in the study to capture the damage indices associated with each type of slab and earthquake. The compared results from the analysis revealed that floor system significantly influences the induced story responses as well as the level of damage of the buildings. Regardless the type of floor, findings from the study also revealed that response demand and damage index values were magnified for fling-step rather than forward-directivity motions leading to more severe damage to buildings. © 2021 Institution of Structural Engineers",Influence of floor system on seismic behavior of RC buildings to forward directivity and fling-step in the near-fault region,2021,"Fling-step; Forward-directivity; Near-fault motions; RC buildings, slab systems; Seismic response",None,0,0
13041,"The role of ground motion duration on the seismic performance of building structures remains unclear. This paper presents results on the effects of ground motion duration on the seismic behaviour of a 3-D plan-asymmetric reinforced concrete building. A three-story reinforced concrete building tested in Europe is used as a case study. A nonlinear model of the building with fibre-section distributed inelasticity displacement-based beam-column elements is subjected to two ground motion sets: (1) long-duration bi-directional earthquake ground motions, and (2) short-duration bi-directional earthquake ground motions. A new ground motion selection procedure is proposed to isolate the effect of duration on the structural response and on damage assessment. For comparative studies, long- and short-duration ground motions are selected so that they have similar response spectra. The damage assessment is performed analysing global and local responses. Global responses of the structure are evaluated in terms of peak roof drift ratios, peak interstory drift ratios (IDRs), IDR envelopes, normalized roof displacements relative to motion of the centre of gravity of the roof, and dissipated energy. Local responses assessed include moment-curvature or moment-rotation response in beams and columns as well as the hysteretic energy dissipated at selected sections of the structure. Two damage indices available in the literature are used to characterize the level of damage that the structure experiences, through damage index-based fragility curves that are developed as part of the work. For the short-duration motions, fragility curves developed independently from interstory responses and from the damage indices are similar, thus providing confidence into the use of the damages indices for fragility curve development. In addition, results indicate that for the vintage plan-asymmetric building analysed, the ground motion duration plays a role in the damage predicted using the two damage indices. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Influence of ground motion duration on damage index-based fragility assessment of a plan-asymmetric non-ductile reinforced concrete building,2017,Damage indices; Ground motion duration; Ground motion selection; Nonlinear dynamic analyses; Plan-asymmetric non-ductile RC building,Buildings; Concrete buildings; Concretes; Damping; Ductility; Dynamics; Earthquake effects; Earthquakes; Energy dissipation; Geophysics; Reinforced concrete; Roofs; Seismic response; Seismology; Structural analysis; Asymmetric buildings; Bi-directional earthquakes; Damage index; Fragility assessment; Ground motion selections; Ground motions; Inter-story drift ratios; RC buildings; Damage detection; displacement; dynamic analysis; ground motion; index method; multistorey building; nonlinearity; prediction; reinforced concrete; seismic response; structural component; structural response; Europe,0,0
13042,"High-strength longitudinal reinforcement can benefit the constructability and economy of concrete structures but concerns regarding the ductility and fatigue resistance have delayed its applications for seismic design. To evaluate the influence of reinforcement fracture on building seismic safety, a new damage model is developed using available data from reinforcement and member tests, and is employed with nonlinear dynamic analyses to assess and compare the seismic performance of concrete special moment frames with Grade 80 and 100 bars to frames with Grade 60 bars. The bar fracture and structural collapse risks are shown to depend on the bar yield strength, tensile-to-yield strength ratio (T/Y), and bar slenderness (s/d(b)) between lateral ties. Frames with Grade 80 and 100 bars (T/Y >= 1.2; s/d(b) <= 5) have comparable performance to frames with Grade 60 bars, where bar fracture probabilities are less than approximately 10% in frames (with maximum story drift ratios up to 0.04).",Influence of High-Strength Reinforcing Bars on Seismic Safety of Concrete Frames,2021,collapse safety; concrete special moment frame; high-strength reinforcing bar; reinforcement fatigue and fracture; seismic design,SPECIAL MOMENT FRAMES,0,0
13043,"Past studies have observed increased vulnerability of the structures when subjected to mainshock-aftershock (MS-AS) ground motion sequences instead of mainshocks (MS) alone. The lack of availability of as-recorded real MS-AS ground motion sequences for the seismic performance assessment of the structure has led to the use of artificially generated sequences. This study aims to quantify the relationship between MS and AS ground motion characteristics in a MS-AS sequence. It also evaluates the need to utilize these relations in developing artificial MS-AS sequences for seismic response evaluation of structures. To this end, a real ground motion database comprising of 192 MS-AS sequences is compiled from different ground motion databases. A univariate and a multivariate linear regression model quantifying the relationship between MS and AS ground motion characteristics in a sequence are developed. Artificial MS-AS sequences are simulated using these regression models. An analytical nonlinear model of four story modern reinforced concrete moment frame building is subjected to sets of real and artificial MS-AS sequences through incremental dynamic analysis (IDA). The IDA results from each set of MS-AS sequences are used to generate seismic collapse fragility curves. The results indicate that the median collapse capacity for the building model calculated using artificial MS-AS sequence set based on regression models developed in the study match closely with the real MS-AS sequence set. © 13th International Conference on Applications of Statistics and Probability in Civil Engineering, ICASP 2019.

13044,"The economic losses arisen in the industrial sector after the Emilia earthquakes in 2012 highlighted the importance of conducting reliable seismic assessment analyses on the existing industrial building stock in order to ascertain both safety and potential losses associated to seismic events. To accomplish to such task, an accurate representation and quantification of the actual vulnerabilities in such buildings is required and reliable structural models need to be adopted. The paper investigates how various assumptions and levels of sophistication in finite element modelling affect the results in terms of economic losses, herein assumed as the reference decision variable. After the definition of the main seismic vulnerabilities of precast industrial buildings typical of the Italian territory, different types of finite element models are adopted and non-linear time history analyses conducted; in particular, the reinforced concrete fork at the top of the column is modelled in different ways, also considering the seismic retrofit. Appropriate fragility curves under selected engineering demand parameters are defined and provided within the Performance Based Earthquake Engineering methodology developed at the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center for the assessment of the expected losses under a scenario-based earthquake. The influence of the modelling assumptions in the seismic risk estimate is evaluated. The results indicate that for the considered case study and in the absence of loss of support, simplified single-column models are suitable to estimate the expected losses. © 2017 The Authors.

The isolated structures are described by an equivalent inelastic 2dof model and the friction coefficient is assumed as a random variable. The inelastic characteristics of the superstructures are designed according to life safety limit state for L'Aquila site (Italy), in compliance with NTC08, by increasing strength reduction factors for each group of ground motions. Incremental dynamic analyses (IDA) are developed to evaluate the seismic fragility curves of both the inelastic superstructure and the isolation level assuming appropriate limit states.

13046,"Many concrete engineering structures have already withstood the historical loads (such as initial compressive/ tensile load) prior to being subjected to dynamic loads. The historical load and structure size are two influential factors on dynamic mechanical performance of concrete. Exploring the dynamic size effect of concrete with different loading histories is a valuable task. In this work, the influence of pre-static compressive/tensile loads on dynamic compressive failure and the corresponding dynamic size effect was investigated by the developed mesoscale finite element method. The research results show that the dynamic compressive strength of concrete decreases with the increasing pre-static compressive load under low strain-rates while it increases with the increasing pre-static tensile load. Dynamic strength under high strain-rates is not affected by the pre-static loads. Moreover, as the concrete has withstood more pre-static loads, the dynamic size effect on compressive strength becomes more obvious under low strain-rates. Finally, the numerical results were analyzed and confirmed by the application of Weibull size effect law.",Influence of pre-static loads on dynamic compression and corresponding size effect of concrete: Mesoscale analysis,2021,Size effect; Concrete; Strain-rate effect; Pre-static load; Finite element analysis; Dynamic compression,PLASTIC-DAMAGE MODEL; STRENGTH; STRAIN; BEHAVIOR; FRACTURE; FAILURE; STRESS; SHAPE; ROCK,0,0
13047,"Reinforced concrete frame buildings with Open Ground Story (OGS) are one of the most common building configurations in urban habitat. These configurations are known to be vulnerable to seismic excitations, primarily due to the sudden loss in strength in the ground story and differential stiffness distribution throughout the structure. The differential stiffness distribution is attributed primarily to the interaction of non-structural infill wall with the moment-resisting frame. Hence, the interaction of infill wall needs to be accounted in estimating the seismic vulnerability. Therefore, the present investigation is focused on understanding the impact of utilizing real ground motion records on the performance assessment of RC buildings with and without consideration of infill walls. Fragility curves were developed for low and mid-rise structural models using Capacity Spectrum Method (CSM) specified by ATC-40 and with Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA). CSM uses the response spectrum specified by the respective code, unlike IDA where an ensemble of spectrum compatible real ground motion accelerograms satisfying the necessary site conditions is used in assessing the performance. Further, significant variations observed in the developed fragility curves by CSM and IDA emphasizes the sensitivity of real ground motion data in performance assessment.",Influence of Real Ground Motion Records in Performance Assessment of RC Buildings,2019,Capacity Spectrum Method; Damage Probability Matrices; Incremental Dynamic Analysis; Open Ground Story Buildings; Seismic Fragility; Seismic Performance,FRAGILITY CURVES,0,0
13048,"In this work, 3D reinforced concrete (RC) and steel building structures have been considered for studying the effect of soil-structure interaction modelling on the structural fragility assessment of such structures. In particular, three foundation models were considered: fixed model where soil-structure interaction is neglected, spring model with single-node Winkler springs and pile foundation model where soil-structure interaction is simulated using beam and quadrilateral finite elements for the pile and soil numerical simulation, respectively. For the assessment of the structural performance and the influence of the various soil-structure interaction numerical simulation models, fragility analysis is applied by considering four limit-states. For the purpose of the current study 3D, low-, mid-and high-rise RC and steel buildings are studied. The test examples employed in this study were designed first according to Eurocodes 2, 3 and 8 using the SCADA Pro analysis and design software and then nonlinear static analyses were performed for developing the fragility curves. Comparing the outcome of fragility analysis it was observed that for the case of the low-and mid-rise buildings, the structural performance was not affected significantly by the foundation system. However, it was observed that the foundation system contributes considerably to the overall structural performance of the high-rise structures examined.

13049,"It has been widely recognized that soil-structure interaction (SSI) can have a significant effect on structural performance during seismic response. This effect varies depending on structural and local site characteristics, meaning that general conclusions, relevant to a large class of structural and site characteristics, cannot be drawn. Therefore, SSI must be considered on a case-by-case basis. In this study, the seismic performance of a typical Chilean shear-wall reinforced concrete (RC) building is assessed, considering fixed-base and SSI response, using a two dimensional numerical model. The geometric and material characteristics of the building are chosen to be representative of a 20-story RC residential building. Such characteristics include wall density, story weight per unit area, inter-story height, length and width of walls, reinforcement ratio for the boundary elements and wall web, among others. Its design followed the Chilean seismic code provisions. The numerical model of the prototype RC building was developed using the program OpenSEES, wherein fiber-based beam elements using non-linear materials were considered. SSI effects were incorporated by modeling the site using a linear continuum approach discretized by two-dimensional quadrilateral finite elements. Materials were chosen consistent with a class B site (Vs30 > 500 m/s), according to the Chilean site classification of the NCh433 seismic code, which is common in some populated cities in Chile, such as Santiago. Also, a fixed-base model was developed for comparison.Fragility curves were obtained through incremental dynamic analysis (IDA), using a set of 34 acceleration ground-motion records obtained from the Chilean National Seismic Center. Different damage measures were extracted from the simulations, e.g.: inter-story drift, floor acceleration, axial load levels measured in the walls, among others. Two sets of fragility curves were obtained considering the inter-story drift of the first floor, one for a fixed-base model and the second, for a model including SSI. The results shown in this study showcase the importance of SSI effects in the structural response of shear-wall RC buildings in Chile. The inclusion of SSI effects in fragility curves is of importance to damage evaluation and risk assessment studies, which use the fragility curves as an input. © NCEE 2018.",Influence of soil-structure-interaction in shear-wall RC buildings fragility curves,2018,None,Concrete buildings; Damage detection; Engineering geology; Floors; Numerical models; Reinforced concrete; Risk assessment; Seismic design; Seismic response; Shear walls; Soil structure interactions; Structural analysis; Incremental dynamic analysis; Material characteristics; Quadrilateral finite element; Reinforcement ratios; Residential building; Seismic code provision; Structural performance; Two dimensional numerical models; Shear flow,0,0

Models are developed in a typical structural system with variation of span-length in one direction. Non-linear static pushover analysis is carried out to obtain seismic structural response. Damage states are defined according to drift and strength values upon analyzing the structural response. Fragility function is then used to develop curves that relate spectral displacements to the probability of reaching structural damage levels.

13051,"This paper aims to analyse the ductility of existing buildings to evaluate its influence in their seismic performance. This has been achieved through the retrospective analysis of an existing building in accordance with current seismic codes. This study has revealed the lack of guidance in the NCSE02 and the EC8 regarding the assessment of the ductility of existing buildings. This manuscript proposes a methodology to assess the ductility of Spanish existing buildings. For this purpose, this paper has implemented the American code procedure combined with the EC8 and the Spanish seismic code (NCSE02) requirements. A two-storey RC frame school located in the Spanish region of Huelva has been selected as a case study. Different versions of this school have been compared: as built, designed according to current best practice, EC8 provisions and NCSE02 provisions. To do so, different constructive features have been varied according to each of the ductility class requirements: geometrical properties and the reinforcement ratio of the structural elements. Nonlinear static analyses have been carried out to obtain the displacement ductility factor (mu) and the behaviour factor (q) of each model. Construction costs and the expected damage index have been determined and compared. Results have shown that the best performance, regarding the ductility and the costs, has been obtained with the models designed with deep beams. Conversely, models with wide beams, and where only the reinforcement ratios have been varied, have merely shown a slight enhancement of the resistant and ductile capacity.

Building Information Modeling (BIM), rapid scanning and other assessment technologies offer the opportunity not only to retrieve as-built information but also to compile as-damaged models.

Two examples of damaged structures from recent earthquake events, compiled using an experimental damage modeling software, illustrate the use of the data model. The model introduces two new classes, one to represent segments of building elements and the other to model the relationships between segments and cracks.

The damage descriptions for seven common damage modes of structural walls were studied by employing the affinity diagramming method. The study showed that the information required to represent the damaged conditions can be grouped under five broad categories and using seventeen damage parameters.

13055,"Reinforced Concrete (RC) buildings with clay masonry infills are a very common structural typology worldwide for civil, strategic or productive use. Damage to infills may cause danger for human lives and strongly affects economic losses, as shown during past earthquakes. Despite their role is crucial in terms of global and local response of RC buildings in the event of an earthquake, in current practice, infills are considered as partition elements without any structural function. The behaviour of infills under seismic actions has to be reliably characterized, starting from the analysis of their displacement capacity at different performance levels due to in plane actions, and a proper complete numerical modelling, able to reproduce their influence on the global behaviour of RC frames under seismic actions. Some models have been already proposed in literature, but their reliability should be yet proved on the basis of an as wide as possible experimental database. Therefore, in this paper, a homogenous extensive database of experimental tests on RC frames infilled with hollow clay-masonry infills - typical of Italian and Mediterranean RC building stock - is collected and presented. The experimental responses of the infills under lateral loads are obtained and the main related numerical models existing in literature are investigated and compared with the experimental results. A new modelling proposal is carried out to obtain a simple practice-oriented force-displacement envelope to significantly reduce the errors in the prediction of the infill in-plane behaviour under lateral loads. The experimental evolutions of damage under increasing displacement demand are also analysed, and the displacement capacity at given performance levels are identified and correlated to the in-plane behaviour of the infill panels. The analysis of the damage evolution to the infills during the experimental tests finally allows the definition of drift-based fragility functions for these components, representing a key point for a more reliable estimation of losses due to earthquakes.",In-plane behaviour and damage assessment of masonry infills with hollow clay bricks in RC frames,2018,RC buildings; Masonry infills; Hollow day bricks; Experimental database; Single-strut models; Performance levels; Fragility curves,REINFORCED-CONCRETE FRAMES; OF-THE-ART; NONLINEAR BEHAVIOR; SEISMIC RESPONSE; R/C FRAMES; OPENINGS; BUILDINGS; FRAGILITY; PANELS,0,0
13056,"An experimental program was performed for evaluating the seismic response and fragilities of nonstructural lightweight steel drywall partitions, also considering the interaction with structural elements and other nonstructural building components, ie, outdoor façade walls. Therefore, in-plane quasi-static reversed cyclic tests were carried out on 8 specimens of indoor partition walls infilled in a frame and on 4 specimens of indoor partition walls connected at its ends with transversal outdoor façade walls. Constructive parameters under investigation include type of connections used for connecting the indoor partition walls to the surrounding elements, stud spacing, type of sheathing panels, and type of jointing finishing. The effect of the constructive parameters on the lateral response in secant stiffness and strength is examined. Furthermore, the main damage phenomena observed during the tests are reported and associated to 3 damage limit states distinguished for the required repair level for the tested partition walls. Fragility curves are used for the experimental assessment of seismic fragility of the tested specimens, in accordance with the interstorey drift limits required by the European code.

13057,"History shows that countries along the Dead Sea Transform, including Israel, have suffered considerable destruction from strong earthquakes, and thus, a modern approach for damage and loss estimations is essential in mitigating damage from future earthquakes. Yet to date, only preliminary damage scenarios have been developed. The present study uses the Hazus MH 2.1 (2012) software to simulate damage and loss estimation for seven earthquakes that may affect Israel. For the first time, over 2,200 different building construction schemes, including a comprehensive nationwide building inventory of over 900K buildings, were simulated in order to identify the high-risk areas and suggest potential mitigation strategies as well as a financial budget plan that would ultimately alleviate the anticipated catastrophe in Israel. The results show excellent ability of Hazus to resolve the expected levels of damage, including damages for various types of buildings, debris and economic losses. Furthermore, it shows that the most intensive damage is expected to concentrate in northern Israel, mainly in the Haifa and Bet Sheàn regions, as well as in areas of older building stock and adjacent to the major fault lines. Comparison between the budget required for strengthening structures and the economic loss expected after a strong earthquake shows that strengthening structures will undoubtedly reduce the disaster magnitude dramatically. The loss estimations can provide decision makers a tool for planning post-earthquake emergency actions including rescue, debris clearance, building inspection, sheltering requirements and directing the civil protection authorities in a focused and proper response during an earthquake event. Although local fragility curves have not yet been developed in Israel, the new scenarios presented here demonstrate that the benefits of realizing already now the rough scope of earthquake damage greatly outdo future gains from as yet unavailable exact assessments. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Insights from Hazus loss estimations in Israel for Dead Sea Transform earthquakes,2015,Dead Sea Transform; Earthquake damage; Hazus; Israel; Loss estimation,None,0,0

In the first place, the cured specimens were corroded in brine solution at room temperature for 90 days.

Then, a three-dimensional nanoindentation model was established with finite element method and modified constitutive relation. The input parameters of the model were calibrated based on the test results and linear interpolation method. Finally, the difference between the simulation results and the experimental results was compared with good agreement. Therefore, the nanoindentation model established in this paper can predict the nanoindentation experiment well and the modified constitutive relation is effective. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

13060,"The occurrence of geological events such as landslides is one of the main causes of damage along linear infrastructures: Damage to transport infrastructures, as roads, bridges, and railways, can restrict their optimal functions and contribute to traffic accidents. The frequent and accurate monitoring of slope instability phenomena and of their interaction with existing man-made infrastructures plays a key role in risk prevention and mitigation activities. In this way, the use of high-resolution X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, characterized by short revisiting times, has demonstrated to be a powerful tool for a periodical noninvasive monitoring of ground motion and superstructure stability, aimed at improving the efficiency of inspection, repairing, and rehabilitation efforts. In the present work, we suggest a semiautomatic GIS approach, which, by using satellite radar interferometry data and results of geomorphological field survey integrated in a qualitative vulnerability matrix, allows to identify sections with different levels of damage susceptibility, where detailed conventional in situ measurements are required for further analysis. The procedure has been tested to investigate landslide-induced effects on a linear infrastructure in Campania Region (Italy), the Provincial Road P.R. 264, which is affected, along its linear development, by several slope instabilities.

13061,"For existing structures, the development of seismic vulnerability studies requires the availability of information related to geometry, boundary conditions, material properties, and accumulated damage. In the case of historical constructions, modern conservation criteria recommend carrying out a comprehensive structural assessment that involves the use of concurrent experimental diagnosis complemented with numerical and analytical approaches for structural analysis. This paper presents a proposal for a comprehensive integration of these perspectives by the application of several tools for the seismic performance analysis of an iconic Andean historical adobe building: the 'San Pedro Apostol Church' located in Andahuaylillas, Southern Peru. In this church, several non-destructive techniques for geometrical and damage assessment were combined with structural exploration tools, nonlinear numerical modeling, and simplified analytical tools for performing predictive seismic analysis. The results indicate the feasibility of the integration of these techniques for studying existing earthen buildings and their capacity to properly predict observed damage in past earthquakes (i.e. failures of bell towers, façade walls, tympani, and triumphal arches). In particular, the analyses allowed the identification of high seismic vulnerability of the studied church in occasional earthquakes (earthquakes with a return period of 72 years) due to the activation of collapse mechanisms consisting of rocking of the façade walls and out-of-plane overturning of the lateral walls. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Integration of non-destructive testing, numerical simulations, and simplified analytical tools for assessing the structural performance of historical adobe buildings",2021,3d reconstruction; Adobe masonry; Ambient vibration testing; Kinematic limit analysis; N2 method; Pushover analysis,Computational methods; Damage detection; Earthquake engineering; Earthquakes; Engineering geology; Integration testing; Masonry materials; Nondestructive examination; Numerical models; Religious buildings; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Vibration analysis; Walls (structural partitions); 3D reconstruction; Adobe masonry; Ambient Vibration Testing; Analytical tool; Kinematic limit analyse; N2 method; Non destructive testing; Push-over analysis; Seismic vulnerability; Structural performance; Integration,0,0
13062,"The details of a multi-hazard and probabilistic risk assessment, developed for urban planning and emergency response activities in Manizales, Colombia, are presented in this article. This risk assessment effort was developed under the framework of an integral disaster risk management project whose goal was to connect risk reduction activities by using open access and state-of-the-art risk models. A probabilistic approach was used for the analysis of seismic, landslide, and volcanic hazards to obtain stochastic event sets suitable for probabilistic loss estimation and to generate risk results in different metrics after aggregating in a rigorous way the losses associated to the different hazards. Detailed and high resolution exposure databases were used for the building stock and infrastructure of the city together with a set of vulnerability functions for each of the perils considered. The urban and territorial ordering plan of the city was updated for socioeconomic development and land use using the hazard and risk inputs and determinants, which cover not only the current urban area but also those adjacent areas where the expansion of Manizales is expected to occur. The emergency response capabilities of the city were improved by taking into account risk scenarios and after updating an automatic and real-time post-earthquake damage assessment. © 2017, The Author(s).","Integration of Probabilistic and Multi-Hazard Risk Assessment Within Urban Development Planning and Emergency Preparedness and Response: Application to Manizales, Colombia",2017,Emergency response; Manizales (Colombia); Multi-hazard risk assessment; Probabilistic hazard analysis; Probabilistic risk assessment; Urban planning,development project; disaster management; hazard assessment; land use planning; natural disaster; probability; risk assessment; territorial planning; urban development; urban planning; Caldas; Colombia; Manizales,0,0
13063,"In seismic risk assessment of structures, fragility functions are the probabilistic characterization of vulnerability at the component and/or structural level, expressing the probability of failure as a function of a ground motion intensity measure (IM). Fragility curves, in general, are structure- and site-specific, thus a comparison of fragility curves, then of vulnerability, is not straightforward across multiple structures. Also, it could be the case that hazard at a site of interest is not available for the IM originally considered in the fragility assessment. These situations require to convert fragility curves from an original IM to a target one. The present study addresses a hazard-consistent probabilistic framework for converting spectral acceleration-based IMs from an original IM to a target IM at a given site. In particular, three conversion cases, under different assumptions on the explanatory power of the involved IMs with respect to structural failure, are discussed: (a) a vector-valued IM consisting of the original and target IMs, magnitude, and source-to-site distance; (b) a vector-valued IM consisting of the original and target IMs; and (c) the original (scalar) IM only, assuming that structural response, given the IM, is statistically independent of the other ground motion variables. In this framework, the original fragility functions are characterized using the state-of-the-art methods in performance-based earthquake engineering, then the fragility curves as a function of the target IM are evaluated through applications of the probability calculus rules, ensuring consistency with the seismic hazard at the site of interest. The conversion strategy is illustrated through the applications to three-, six-, and nine-story Italian code-conforming reinforced concrete buildings designed for a high-hazard site in Italy. The study shows that, in most of the cases, the converted fragility curves have agreement with the reference curves directly developed in terms of the target IM. Cases in which least agreement was found are likely due to the models used to obtain the terms required by the conversion equations. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Intensity measure conversion of fragility curves,2020,performance-based earthquake engineering; probabilistic seismic risk assessment; seismic vulnerability; vector-valued intensity measures,Calculations; Concrete buildings; Earthquake effects; Earthquake engineering; Engineering geology; Fracture mechanics; Hazards; Outages; Reinforced concrete; Risk assessment; Ground motion intensity measures; Intensity measure; Performance-based earthquake engineering; Probabilistic framework; Probabilistic seismic risk assessments; Seismic risk assessment; Seismic vulnerability; State-of-the-art methods; Failure (mechanical); building code; earthquake engineering; failure analysis; ground motion; performance assessment; probability; risk assessment; seismic design; seismic response; structural analysis; structural response; vulnerability; Italy,0,0
13064,"Slit dampers are a specific type of metallic yielding dampers, which are created by cutting a series of slits/openings in metal plates subjected to in-plane shear deformation. These slits/openings divide the metal plates into a number of links that dissipate the input energy through their plastic in-plane deformations. In this paper, a new brace-type slit damper (BSD) is proposed, and the behavior of the structure equipped with it is studied numerically. It consists of two diagonal members on both sides of a slit plate with a designed geometry for its links. Each diagonal member is pinned to the beam at one end and at the other end is only constrained against out-of-plane displacement by a gusset plate. First, the accuracy of numerical models is validated by a series of available experimental results. Then, a parametric study is performed on the frames equipped with the proposed damper to determine the effects of geometrical parameters of the damper on the behavior of the frame. After that, analytical equations are developed to predict the behavior of BSD and structures equipped with it. A simple and robust method is also proposed to simulate the behavior of all damper components with an equivalent diagonal member in structural analysis softwares. Afterwards, using this approach, several multi-story building frames equipped with the proposed damper are modeled and the seismic behavior of these frames is evaluated using nonlinear time history analyses. The results show that all studied frames have completely stable hysteresis curves under all records, and no crack was observed in the damper links at the end of the loadings. According to the obtained results, it can be concluded that the proposed damper can be used as an efficient energy dissipating device in building structures. © 2020 Institution of Structural Engineers",Introducing and numerical study of a new brace-type slit damper,2020,Brace-type damper; Ductile Damage model; Energy dissipation; Metallic yielding dampers; Steel slit dampers,None,0,0
13065,"With the ongoing development of the National Water Model at the National Water Center (NWC) in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, the hydrologic and hydraulic predictive capabilities of the USA are rapidly evolving. As this evolution continues, the National Water Model will make possible the ability to reconsider how researchers approach flood damage assessment. Flood damage wizard (FDW) is a new software application developed by the authors that quickly constructs a regional building inventory from cadastral information for use in rapid flood damage studies. Hazus-MH is a fixture in long-term planning studies, such as FEMA Flood Risk Reports. Each model relies on the accuracy of the building usage or occupancy assignment and the valuation of the replacement cost of the building. This article investigates how two different approaches to modeling flood damage demonstrate the uncertainty in classifying the usage and valuation of structures by comparing FDW to three Hazus-MH Level 2 analyses in central Alabama. The results show the need for better communication of these uncertainties to end users. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Investigating Uncertainty in Developing Regional Building Inventories for Flood Damage Prediction,2017,Building inventories; Cadastral; Cadastre; Flood damage; Floods; Geographic information systems; Model inputs; Parcel; Rapid assessment,Application programs; Buildings; Flood damage; Floods; Geographic information systems; Information use; Uncertainty analysis; Building inventory; Cadastral; Cadastre; Model inputs; Parcel; Rapid assessment; Damage detection; building; flood; flood damage; GIS; hazard assessment; hazard management; prediction; software; uncertainty analysis; Alabama; Tuscaloosa; United States,0,0
13066,"Seismic risk assessment of unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings is an important process for seismic retrofit of essential facilities located in the central and southern United States (CSUS), as more than 30 % of facilities there are low-rise URM buildings. Although HAZUS, the current loss estimation package for natural hazards, provides a set of fragility curves for such structures as an essential tool for conducting seismic risk assessment, seismic performance level variation due to geometric characteristics is not explicitly considered. This study investigates the effect of geometric variation of low-rise URM structures on seismic fragility assessment. Utilizing URM building inventory information within the CSUS region, variables that describe the physical shape of URM structures are identified. A simplified composite spring model developed for URM structures is then utilized to monitor nonlinear seismic behavior. Finally, seismic fragility curves corresponding to various shape configurations of URM structures are developed and compared. The analysis confirms that the length of out-of-plane walls and the number of stories in URM buildings have significant effects on seismic risk. An increase in the wall length or the number of stories makes URM buildings more vulnerable. On the other hand, the perforation ratio does not significantly affect seismic performance. It is suggested that using a single set of fragility curves is not adequate for seismic risk assessment of low-rise URM buildings unless geometric variation is considered explicitly. In addition, comparing the fragility curves developed in this study with HAZUS data, it is clear that the seismic vulnerability of low-rise URM is underestimated in HAZUS for lower limit states and overestimated for higher limit states. © 2016, Iran University of Science and Technology.",Investigation of the Geometric Variation Effect on Seismic Performance of Low-Rise Unreinforced Masonry Structures Through Fragility Analysis,2018,Composite spring model; Geometric variation; Seismic fragility; Unreinforced masonry,Composite structures; Concrete buildings; Geometry; Masonry materials; Risk perception; Seismic waves; Seismology; Springs (components); Walls (structural partitions); Composite spring model; Geometric characteristics; Geometric variations; Seismic fragility; Seismic fragility curves; Seismic risk assessment; Unreinforced masonry; Unreinforced masonry structures; Risk assessment,0,0
13067,"Italian Risk MAps (IRMA) is an innovative IT platform developed by European centre for training and research in earthquake engineering (Eucentre) with funds of the Italian Civil Protection Department, and addressed to the scientific community. IRMA allows data sharing, methods and models aimed to evaluate the seismic risk of Italian residential buildings, in order to comply with the requirements of the “Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030” (Sendai Framework). IRMA uses OpenQuake, a calculation engine developed as part of the Global Earthquake Model, to evaluate earthquake loss estimation. The user can create and upload different exposure/vulnerability databases as well as different sets of fragility curves on the platform. The hazard used in the platform is the MPS04 hazard model, developed by National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology that is actually the reference hazard map for the Italian code regulation. IRMA is extremely flexible: by combining the different exposure databases with all the possible sets of fragility curves, the user can produce maps of conditional damage (i.e. the return period is selected) or unconditional damage (i.e. an observation time window is selected). Damage scenarios can also be performed by using shakemaps of seismic events as input. The shakemaps, preloaded in the platform, are those referred to the recent seismic events in Italy. The article describes the context in which IRMA was developed, its features and architecture.

13071,"This paper proposes a simple and fast method for the identification of structural changes affecting buildings in urban environments by using a combination of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery and Geospatial Information System (GIS) processing. The identification of changes in urban settlements is of great interest for damage assessment after natural disasters, cadastral mapping and monitoring urban development or illegal activities, such as the construction of unauthorized buildings. Satellite remote sensing is useful in this scenario and SAR data is attractive due to its wide and ubiquitous coverage, the day and night all-weather availability, the exact repetition of the acquisition geometry, the repeated illumination and the sensitivity to slight changes in the geometrical structure of the targets in the scene. This sensibility is an advantage, but turns into a drawback especially in an urban environment where every subtle change may cause an unwanted detection. This environment is indeed one of the most challenging for the detection of those changes that are of any real interest since these events are masked by thousands of irrelevant detections. This paper tackle this problem with a combination of an improved, high-resolution coherent change detection technique called M-CCD and with a GIS post-processing. The result is a map of changes affecting buildings that are of a significant scale and consequently of a certain interest in an urban environment. In this contribution, the complete workflow is detailed and an assessment of the detected changes is done with high resolution optical images through visual photo-interpretation. A comparison with other SAR and optical change detection methods is also carried out. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Joint exploitation of spaceborne SAR images and GIS techniques for urban coherent change detection,2021,CCD; Change detection; GIS; SAR; Urban,Damage detection; Disasters; Geographic information systems; Geometrical optics; Remote sensing; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Urban growth; Acquisition geometry; Coherent change detection; Geo-spatial information systems; Geometrical structure; High-resolution optical images; Illegal activities; Satellite remote sensing; Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery; Radar imaging; GIS; natural disaster; remote sensing; synthetic aperture radar; urban area; urban development,0,0
13072,"Rainstorms easily can cause serious secondary disasters such as waterlogging, debris flow, and flood, and the combination of these secondary disasters makes cities more vulnerable. However, to date, few studies have considered the joint effects of rainstorm secondary disasters, and the common procedures or methods for joint risk assessment have not been developed. Considering the joint effects of rainstorm waterlogging and rainstorm debris flow, this paper proposes a modeling method for joint risk assessment based on multisource spatial data including meteorological data, geological data, and building data, and analyzed the residential buildings in a built-up area of Wuhan East Lake High-Tech Development Zone, China. First, the improved rainstorm waterlogging model was proposed to generate waterlogging simulation results with consideration of the influences of rain storage facilities such as lakes and reservoirs on waterlogging results. Second, the rainstorm debris flow model was employed to generate the simulation results of debris flow. Then the damage to residences were calculated with stage-damage curves under single secondary disasters. Finally, a Bayesian network model was built and applied to generate the joint risk of the secondary disasters according to the simulation results of waterlogging and debris flow. The results show that the joint effects of waterlogging and debris flow first increase and then decrease with the increase of precipitation. The joint disaster loss cannot simply be calculated by finding the maximum or sum of the single disaster losses, but must be obtained with a specific reasoning method. The joint disaster loss presented evident spatial disparities. The secondary disasters mainly affected the area near northern mountains, the central area was in the medium-risk zone, and the other areas were less affected. The annual average loss of residential buildings in the studied area was CNY 15.82 million. The findings provide important information for the local area and are expected to help the rainstorm risk management of other jurisdictions. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Joint Risk Assessment of the Secondary Disasters of Rainstorms based on Multisource Spatial Data in Wuhan, China",2020,Joint risk; Rainstorm; Risk assessment; Secondary disasters; Spatial data,Atmospheric movements; Bayesian networks; Debris; Digital storage; Disasters; Housing; Lakes; Reservoirs (water); Risk management; Thunderstorms; Bayesian network models; Lake sand reservoirs; Meteorological data; Multi-source spatial data; Reasoning methods; Residential building; Secondary disasters; Storage facilities; Risk assessment; disaster management; rainstorm; risk assessment; spatial data; China; Hubei; Wuhan,0,0

13074,"Damage assessment is a very important task after an earthquake. On the basis of the experience of the past Algerian earthquakes, it is important to recognize that often the number of professional experts is insufficient, therefore, non-expert professionals should be included in the execution of the damage assessment task. In addition, the use of houses immediately after earthquake is a very common fact among the inhabitants. For that matter, initiatives are multiplying in Algeria aiming at setting up sophisticated and rapid tools dedicated to estimating the earthquake consequences. Thus, this study focuses on the development of a multifunctional Knowledge-Based System (KBS) called post-seismic damage inspection tool (EDPS: Évaluation des Dommages Post-Sismique), a powerful tool which allows the evaluation, the processing and the archiving of the collected data stock after earthquakes. EDPS can be operated by two user types; an ordinary user for the damage visual inspection and an administrative user for updating the knowledge base and/or for adding or removing the expert type user. The tool consists essentially of four modules: interface, help, explanation and knowledge acquisition. The knowledge acquisition is driven by a hierarchical knowledge model. The Information from damage investigation reports and those acquired through feedback from expert/engineer questionnaires are part of the Knowledge Base (KB). Finally, an evaluation test with EDPS was conducted by means of the expert and proprietary interface. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Knowledge-based system for damage assessment after earthquake: Algerian buildings case,2019,Algerian buildings; Damage assessment; Earthquake; Knowledge-based system (KBS),None,0,0
13075,"Uncertainty quantification is an important issue in the seismic fragility analysis of bridge type structures. However, the influence of different sources of uncertainty on the seismic fragility of the system is commonly overlooked due to the costly re-evaluation of numerical model simulations. This paper aims to present a framework for the seismic fragility analysis of reinforced concrete highway bridges, where a data-driven metamodel is developed to approximate the structural response to structural and ground motion uncertainties. The proposed framework to generate fragility curves shows its efficiency while using a few finite element simulations and accounting for various modeling uncertainties influencing the bridge seismic fragility. In this respect, a class of single-bent bridges available in the literature is taken as a case study, whose three-dimensional finite element model is established by the OpenSees software framework. Twenty near-source records from different sources are selected and the Latin hypercube method is applied for generating the random samples of modeling and ground motion parameters. The Kriging metamodel is then driven on the structural response obtained from nonlinear time history analyses. Component fragility curves of the reinforced concrete pier column are derived for different damage states using the Kriging metamodel whose parameters are established considering different modeling parameters generated by Monte Carlo simulations. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework in interpolating the structural response and deriving the fragility curve of the case study with any input conditions of the random variables.",Kriging Metamodel-Based Seismic Fragility Analysis of Single-Bent Reinforced Concrete Highway Bridges,2021,fragility analysis; kriging metamodel; reinforced concrete bridge; nonlinear time history analysis; Monte Carlo simulation,SURROGATE MODELS; EARTHQUAKE,0,0
13076,"Land subsidence caused by groundwater overpumping threatens the sustainable development in Beijing. Hazard assessments of land subsidence can provide early warning information to improve prevention measures. However, uncertainty and fuzziness are the major issues during hazard assessments of land subsidence. We propose a method that integrates fuzzy set theory and weighted Bayesian model (FWBM) to evaluate the hazard probability of land subsidence measured by Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology. The model is structured as a directed acyclic graph. The hazard probability distribution of each factor triggering land subsidence is determined using Bayes' theorem. Fuzzification of the factor significance reduces the ambiguity of the relationship between the factors and subsidence. The probability of land subsidence hazard under multiple factors is then calculated with the FWBM. The subsidence time series obtained by InSAR is used to infer the updated posterior probability. The upper and middle parts of the Chaobai River alluvial fan are taken as a case-study site, which locates the first large-scale emergency groundwater resource region in the Beijing plain. The results show that rates of groundwater level decrease more than 1 m yr(-1) in the confined and unconfined aquifers, with cumulative thicknesses of the compressible sediments between 160 and 170 m and Quaternary thicknesses between 400 and 500 m, yielding maximum hazard probabilities of 0.65, 0.68, 0.32, and 0.35, respectively. The overall hazard probability of land subsidence in the study area decreased from 51.3 % to 28.3 % between 2003 and 2017 due to lower rates of ground-water level decrease.

13078,"The assessment of landslide hazards and risks forms an essential precursor to landslide risk reduction. This is particularly the case when an authority is responsible for an infrastructure or building portfolio that may be affected by multiple hazards. In this paper semi-quantitative and quantitative assessments of landslide hazards and risks to road networks are considered in terms of the risks that affect road users (fatality), road infrastructure and the socio-economic activities that the network facilitates. A framework for risk acceptance is used to set the context, and the use of a semi-quantitative assessment to determine the sites of highest risk is described. These highest risk sites are subject to the first known quantitative risk assessments for road user fatalities as a result of debris flows. A novel approach is taken to assess the socio-economic risks and the use of fragility curves to articulate the vulnerability of road infrastructure, including the newly-developed approach involving systems of assets, is also described.

13079,"Landslides are considered to be one of the main natural geohazards causing relevant economic damages and social effects worldwide. Italy is one of the countries worldwide most affected by landslides; in the Region of Tuscany alone, more than 100,000 phenomena are known and mapped. The possibility to recognize, investigate, and monitor these phenomena play a key role to avoid further occurrences and consequences. The number of applications of Advanced Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (A-DInSAR) analysis for landslides monitoring and mapping greatly increased in the last decades thanks to the technological advances and the development of advanced processing algorithms. In this work, landslide-induced damage on structures recognized and classified by field survey and velocity of displacement re-projected along the steepest slope were combined in order to extract fragility curves for the hamlets of Patigno and Coloretta, in the Zeri municipality (Tuscany, northern Italy). Images using ERS1/2, ENVISAT, COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) and Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) were employed to investigate an approximate 25 years of deformation affecting both hamlets. Three field surveys were conducted for recognizing, identifying, and classifying the landslide-induced damage on structures and infrastructures.

13082,"High-definition laser scanning is rapidly becoming an essential tool for accurate non-destructive three-dimensional measurements of structures. This technology provides valuable information about an object which is discretized in space as ""point clouds"". Two representative examples of current research activities on use of laser scanning in historic buildings in Uzbekistan and California are discussed. The first example is the Registan Square ensemble in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. The ensemble includes several heritage structures. Earthquakes, extreme seasonal temperatures, etc. have left the ensemble in a ruined condition. Domes and portals were partially or totally destroyed. The minarets were dangerously inclined, and some façades lost 70-80% of their ceramic tile coverings. Structural repairs and straightening of the minarets had been conducted over the years. In this study, the ensemble was scanned from about 70 positions to capture the current condition of the historic structures and to conduct structural assessment of the ensemble and its components. The scan data are expected to be used for monitoring of the ensemble's structural condition. In addition to visual scan data inspection, detailed finite element model of the ensemble was generated from the as-found geometry captured by laser scans. This model allows detailed seismic analysis of the monuments and its components. The model developed for the Sher-Dor Madrasah, part of the ensemble, using the scan data and sample preliminary analysis results are presented in this paper. The research team also investigated several historic buildings damaged during the 2014 South Napa Earthquake, California, USA, as the second example.

The case-specific flood disaster-related data mainly categorised into flood characteristics, socio-economy, disaster preparedness, emergency response and impact are collected from the concerned authorities in each country. Data for all selected flood events are compiled and compared to check the seriousness of the flood problem at different localities in the selected regions. At least one flood event from each country, namely Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Cambodia, China, Lao PDR, Vietnam, Thailand, Bangladesh and Nepal, is considered. The analysis was divided into three parts: (1) flood impact sector analysis, (2) flood human death cause analysis and (3) flood disaster critical cause and effect analysis. The result shows that the majority of flood-related deaths was mainly caused by drowning, which accounts 44% of flood deaths. Despite the evacuation advisories issued in 65% cases, many people stayed at homes either due to the lack of timely available information or due to confusion about the reliability of provided information or ignorance or overconfidence with their safety. In many cases, the early warning information did not reach to the community because of the lack of appropriate communication mechanisms. Most of the areas were protected by some levels of structural measures such as levees, but the quantity and quality of such measures are not sufficient and are not often linked to non-structural measures. Large-scale floods acutely impacted on public infrastructures. The worst hit sector was transportation. These results imply the importance of mainstreaming disaster risk management in the development sectors. Mainstreaming flood disaster risk management in the development sectors does not necessarily mean to only protect the hard gained development but at the same time to accelerate and enhance the effort of building resiliency and therefore the socioeconomic development by better planning and designing of any kind of infrastructures in the flood plain areas. The findings from this study are helpful in identifying, prioritising and coordinating the measures for the effective flood risk management at the localities. © 2014 The Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management (CIWEM) and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Lessons learned from southern and eastern Asian urban floods: From a local perspective,2016,Cause and effect; Damage assessment; Disaster preparedness; Emergency response; Flood; Integrated flood risk management; Recovery,building; disaster management; flood; flood control; hazard assessment; hazard management; mortality; natural disaster; Asia,0,0
13084,"Post-bushfire damage assessments show no significant reduction in property damage when compared with past bushfire events. Other than the severity of the attack and the behaviour of the bushfires, the architectural design of the houses, construction materials and, many other factors affect bushfire house ignition. These are generally ignored in the simulations using simplified models. An improved bushfire risk assessment can be conducted if the exact surrounding and the architectural design of the existing houses are considered. However, this is not widely practised due to associated high cost and time, which can be minimised by the adaptation of modern technologies in an efficient way. This study proposes a novel approach to assess the effect of bushfires on individual building structures (houses) in bushfire-prone areas, through heat transfer modelling. It utilises ground and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point cloud to model individual building structures with all their complex features and the surroundings with good dimensional accuracy. These point cloud maps were used to develop heat transfer models by using Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) to investigate wind velocities, temperature profiles and pressure distributions during bushfires. A case study was conducted for a selected house (elevated building structure) using the proposed approach and the results were compared against a simplified cuboid model of the same house. The simulation results show that the proposed approach is capable of identifying the most vulnerable locations of the building structure compared to the simplified model, which emphasises its applicability in bushfire planning and damage mitigation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",LiDAR-based Computational Fluid Dynamics heat transfer models for bushfire conditions,2021,Building structures; Bushfire; Computational fluid dynamics; Heat transfer models; UAV-Captured LiDAR; Wildland Urban Interface fires,None,0,0
13085,"The life-cycle cost analysis of buildings prone to seismic risk is a critical issue in structural engineering. Expected loss, including damage and repair costs, is an important parameter for structural design. The combination of economic theory and computer technology allows for a more developed approach to the design and construction of structures than ever before. In this study, a simplified method based on a semi-probabilistic methodology is developed to evaluate the economic performance of a building prone to seismic risk. The proposed approach aims to identify the most cost-effective strengthening strategies and strengthening levels for existing structures during their structural lifetime. To achieve this, the method identifies the optimal strengthening level, computing on the one hand the costs of strengthening the structure at different performance levels for each strategy, and, on the other, the expected seismic loss during the structure’s lifetime. To assess the expected loss, the building is divided into several components, both structural and non-structural. A set of fragility curves is assigned for each component. Then, once the structural model and the various components of the building, with the corresponding fragility curves, are defined, a loss assessment is performed using a static non-linear analysis. The summation of the strengthening costs and the discounted expected losses produces a relationship between the total costs and the strengthening level. The minimum of this relationship identifies the most cost-effective strengthening intervention. As a case study, this method is applied to an existing reinforced concrete (RC) structure severely damaged by the 2009 earthquake in L’Aquila. Different strategies are analyzed, namely the FRP (fiber reinforced polymer) strengthening of elements, the RC jacketing of columns, RC exterior shear wall insertions, and the base isolation of the building. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Life-cycle cost optimization of the seismic retrofit of existing RC structures,2017,Economic sustainability; Life cycle cost assessment; Seismic assessment,Buildings; Computation theory; Cost effectiveness; Cost engineering; Costs; Earthquake engineering; Economics; Fiber reinforced plastics; Life cycle; Reinforced concrete; Risk assessment; Seismology; Structural design; Economic sustainability; Existing reinforced concrete; Fiber reinforced polymers; Life cycle cost analysis; Lifecycle costs; Probabilistic methodology; Seismic assessment; Static non-linear analysis; Cost benefit analysis; building construction; cost analysis; earthquake event; economic theory; life cycle analysis; optimization; reinforced concrete; seismic design; seismic isolation; seismic retrofit; sustainability; Aquila,0,0
13086,"This paper aimed to investigate the seismic response of reinforced concrete (RC) frame buildings under linear and non-linear dynamic analysis. Different building models as bare frame and fully masonry infill frame have been developed for performing the analysis. In order to investigate the effect of irregular distributions of masonry infill walls in elevation on the seismic response behavior, an infill frame model with soft story has also been developed. The linear response spectrum (RS) dynamic analysis and the nonlinear time-history (TH) analysis methods are employed. Moreover, the induced energies in terms of input, potential and kinetic are also obtained from the TH analysis. Moreover, the interaction between infill walls and frames leads to considerable change in the induced responses comparable with the bare model.",Linear and Nonlinear Dynamic Analysis of Masonry Infill RC Framed Buildings,2017,Response Spectrum; Time-History; Masonry Infill; Soft Story,DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; WALLS; EARTHQUAKE; TURKEY; LOADS,0,0
13087,"Tsunami fragility functions describe the probability of structural damage due to tsunami flow characteristics. Fragility functions developed from past tsunami events (e.g., the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami) are often applied directly, without modification, to other areas at risk of tsunami for the purpose of damage and loss estimations. Consequentially, estimates carry uncertainty due to disparities in construction standards and coastal morphology between the specific region for which the fragility functions were originally derived and the region where they are being used. The main objective of this study is to provide an alternative approach to assessing tsunami damage, especially for buildings in regions where previously developed fragility functions do not exist. A damage assessment model is proposed in this study, where load-resistance analysis is performed for each building by evaluating hydrodynamic forces, buoyancies and debris impacts and comparing them to the resistance forces of each building. Numerical simulation was performed in this study to reproduce the 2011 Great East Japan tsunami in Ishinomaki, which is chosen as a study site. Flow depths and velocities were calculated for approximately 20&thinsp;000 wooden buildings in Ishinomaki. Similarly, resistance forces (lateral and vertical) are estimated for each of these buildings. The buildings are then evaluated for their potential of collapsing. Results from this study reflect a higher accuracy in predicting building collapse when using the proposed load-resistance analysis, as compared to previously developed fragility functions in the same study area. Damage is also observed to have likely occurred before flow depth and velocity reach maximum values. With the above considerations, the proposed damage model might well be an alternative for building damage assessments in areas that have yet to be affected by modern tsunami events. © Author(s) 2019.",Load-resistance analysis: An alternative approach to tsunami damage assessment applied to the 2011 Great East Japan tsunami,2019,None,building; collapse; hydrodynamic force; loading; model; structural analysis; tsunami; Honshu; Ishinomaki; Japan; Miyagi; Tohoku,0,0
13088,"In order to evaluate the loss of rural buildings under the action of wind disaster, a damage assessment method for low-rise buildings was proposed. The influences of various factors, including structural type, preservation degree, building area density and the interaction among different structural components etc., on building loss were analyzed. Damage matrixes of wind speed and wind direction were established for the envelope and the main load-bearing structures, respectively. The damage level of low-rise residential buildings was defined, and a direct loss assessment model of related buildings was established. Furthermore, in order to apply the wind disaster assessment method to actual situation, a secondary development of ArcGIS was carried out, and a typhoon disaster management system was established. Result comparison between the simulation data and the related disaster statistics shows that the as-proposed construction loss assessment method is entirely comprehensive and applicable to some degrees. © 2020, Editorial Department of Journal of Shenyang University of Technology.

13089,"Although damages throughout structures are considered as a main cause of structural collapse, many civil engineering structures keep to be used despite associated possible damage accumulation. Regular condition Monitoring of important civil structures such as bridges and buildings is crucially significant to provide the community with an adequate level of safety for the structures they use every day. Moreover, the need for quick damage assessment of structures after severe events such as earthquakes is essential to avoid unnecessary disorder and reduce economical and downtime impacts. Regarding these important needs, the use of sensor technology integrated within structures could extremely increase the inspection procedure through rapid in-situ data collection and processing. However, utilisation of wired sensory system could increase the installation and maintenance costs of structural health monitoring systems especially for large civil infrastructures. In the past decades, improvement in sensor technology provides researchers with great opportunities to develop wireless sensor nodes for a reliable Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). However, due to some drawbacks of available wireless sensory systems for SHM applications, two series of wireless sensor nodes are designed in this study to collect structural vibrations from different types of large-scale civil structures. The first series of the sensors is a low-cost wireless sensor node and has designed to collect large-amplitude earthquake-induced vibrations from affected structures immediately after earthquakes. The second series of wireless sensor nodes is high-performance and highly sensitive sensor which is designed to record very low-amplitude ambient vibrations from different large and complex civil structures, such as long-span bridges and high-rise buildings. To show the performance of wireless sensors to measure structural vibrations, some field testing are carried out. To this end, several experimental setups are performed on a footbridge and two high-rise office buildings using both versions of wireless sensor nodes and an expensive wired sensory system as the reference system. Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that both versions of wireless sensor nodes are competitive in cost and accuracy with the commercially available wired sensory systems. The accuracy of the low-cost sensor node matches very well with the expensive reference wired system and the resolution and sensitivity of the second version of wireless sensor node is highly promising and more accurate than the reference system to measure very low-amplitude structural vibrations from very large and stiff civil infrastructures. © 2018 NDT.net.

13090,"In 2017, hurricane Maria caused unprecedented damage and fatalities on the Caribbean island of Dominica. In order to ‘build back better’ and to learn from the processes causing the damage, it is important to quickly document, evaluate and map changes, both in Dominica and in other high-risk countries. This paper presents an innovative and relatively low-cost and rapid workflow for accurately quantifying geomorphological changes in the aftermath of a natural disaster. We used unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys to collect aerial imagery from 44 hurricane-affected key sites on Dominica. We processed the imagery using structure from motion (SfM) as well as a purpose-built Python script for automated processing, enabling rapid data turnaround. We also compared the data to an earlier UAV survey undertaken shortly before hurricane Maria and established ways to co-register the imagery, in order to provide accurate change detection data sets. Consequently, our approach has had to differ considerably from the previous studies that have assessed the accuracy of UAV-derived data in relatively undisturbed settings. This study therefore provides an original contribution to UAV-based research, outlining a robust aerial methodology that is potentially of great value to post-disaster damage surveys and geomorphological change analysis. Our findings can be used (1) to utilise UAV in post-disaster change assessments; (2) to establish ground control points that enable before-and-after change analysis; and (3) to provide baseline data reference points in areas that might undergo future change. We recommend that countries which are at high risk from natural disasters develop capacity for low-cost UAV surveys, building teams that can create pre-disaster baseline surveys, respond within a few hours of a local disaster event and provide aerial photography of use for the damage assessments carried out by local and incoming disaster response teams. © 2020, The Author(s).",Low-cost UAV surveys of hurricane damage in Dominica: automated processing with co-registration of pre-hurricane imagery for change analysis,2020,Change analysis; Damage assessment; Disaster response; Hurricane; Image co-registration; Structure from motion (SfM); UAV,aerial photography; data set; geomorphology; hurricane; image analysis; imagery; natural disaster; quantitative analysis; unmanned vehicle; Dominica; Leeward Islands [Lesser Antilles],0,0
13091,"An experimental study was taken to investigate the cumulative seismic damage of reinforced concrete columns with or without steel corrosion and to evaluate the effect of using CFRP wraps on the seismic behavior of the columns. Eleven identical rectangular reinforced concrete columns were constructed and tested under standard cyclic loads with variable drift amplitudes or low-cycle fatigue loads at different constant drift amplitudes. The column models included five un-corroded columns and six columns corroded using an external current method. Test results indicate that steel corrosion reduces the strength, ductility, low-cycle fatigue life, and cumulative energy dissipation capacity of reinforced concrete columns under cyclic loads, whereas the use of CFRP wraps greatly improves the above-mentioned behavior except the strength of un-corroded and corroded columns. The corroded column with a steel corrosion level of about 10% and retrofitted using CFRP wraps exhibited lower loading capacity but much better ductility and cumulative energy dissipation capacity than un-corroded columns. The seismic damage indexes of the columns with or without steel corrosion were also estimated based on the Park-Ang damage model and the relationships between damage indexes and experimental observations were discussed.

13092,"Buckling-restrained braces (BRBs) are commonly used as a kind of energy dissipator in structures, which can be quickly replaced after strong earthquakes. However, there is no reasonable and effective damage assessment method to quantitatively analyze the damage degree in a BRB. Since the cumulative plastic deformation (CPD) of a BRB is closely related to its loading history, the CPD can reflect the low-cycle fatigue life of a BRB. In this paper, two CPD curves of BRBs under low-cycle fatigue damage are presented: C-CPD curves under a constant strain amplitude (CSA) loading history and R-CPD curves under a random strain amplitude (RSA) loading history. The solving process and the shape of two curves are given. In the C-CPD curve, the influence of different fatigue parameters on the curve characteristics is thoroughly studied. In the R-CPD curve, the rationality of the maximum plastic strain range (Delta(epsilon pmax)) as the evaluation index of the R-CPD curve is verified through a sensitivity analysis. Finally, a parametric analysis of the R-CPD curve is presented. The analysis results show that the two curves both pass through the zero point and present an obvious characteristic of increasing then decreasing. The C-CPD curve describes the relationship between Delta epsilon(p)andCPD(c)of BRBs under CSA loading, which can be derived directly from Coffin-Manson curves. Therefore, the C-CPD curve is only influenced by the fatigue parameters. The R-CPD curve describes the relationship between Delta epsilon(pmax)andCPD(c)of BRBs under RSA loading, which is fitted with many IDA results. The R-CPD curve is both greatly influenced by the fatigue parameters, and slightly influenced by the building height, theK(d)/K(f)value and the structure layout. Therefore, the C-CPD curve and the R-CPD curve are inherent curves of BRB. In addition, the sensitivity analysis of the R-CPD curve shows thatCPD(c)is most sensitive to Delta epsilon(pmax), so the Delta epsilon(pmax)is a reliable parameter to reflect the RSA loading history. The two curves provide a theoretical basis for the low-cycle fatigue life evaluation of BRB.",Low-Cycle Fatigue Life Estimation Curve for Buckling-Restrained Braces Based on Cumulative Plastic Deformation,None,Buckling-restrained brace (BRB); low cycle fatigue life; C-CPD curve; R-CPD curve; sensitivity analysis,FRAME; PERFORMANCE; DESIGN; DAMAGE,0,0
13095,"During a mainshock-aftershock (MSAS) sequence, there is no time to retrofit structures that are damaged by a mainshock; therefore, aftershocks could cause additional damage. This study proposes a new approach to develop state-dependent fragility curves using real MSAS records. Specifically, structural responses before and after each event of MSAS sequences are used to obtain statistical relationships among the engineering demand parameter prior to the seismic event (pre-EDP), the intensity measure of the seismic event (IM), and the engineering demand parameter after the seismic event (post-EDP). The developed fragility curves account for damage accumulation, providing the exceeding probability of damage state (DS) given the IM of the event and the DS of the structure prior to the seismic excitation. The UBC-SAWS model, which was developed for wood-frame houses in British Columbia, Canada, is considered as a case study application. Results indicate that for the examined structural typology, state-dependent fragility curves based on residual interstorey drift ratio (pre-EDP), peak ground velocity (IM), and maximum inter-storey drift ratio (post-EDP) are the best choice to characterise the cumulative damage effect. An illustration of the developed fragility curves is provided by considering a hypothetical MSAS scenario of a M-w 9.0 Cascadia mainshock triggering a M-w 6.0 crustal event in the Leech River fault, affecting wooden houses in Victoria, Canada. The MSAS scenario increases Yellow tags (restricted access) by 12.3% and Red tags (no access) by 4.8%.","Mainshock-aftershock state-dependent fragility curves: A case of wood-frame houses in British Columbia, Canada",2020,cloud analysis; multinomial distribution; nonlinear dynamic analysis of wood-frame houses; real mainshock-aftershock sequences; state-dependent aftershock fragility curves,VECTOR INTENSITY MEASURES; WOODFRAME STRUCTURES; ALTERNATIVE SCALAR; SEISMIC ANALYSIS; RISK-ASSESSMENT; STEEL FRAMES; DAMAGE; BUILDINGS; EQUATIONS; PREDICTION,0,0
13096,"In recent years, the additional risk posed to the built environment due to aftershock sequences and triggered events has been brought to attention, and several efforts have been directed towards developing fragility functions for structures in damaged conditions. Despite this rise of interest, a rather fundamental component for such tasks, namely that of aftershock ground motion record selection, has remained under-scrutinized. Herein, we propose a pragmatic procedure that can be applied for the selection of mainshock-aftershock ground motion pairs using consistent causal parameters and accounting for the correlation between their spectral accelerations. In addition, a structural analysis strategy that can be employed for the analytical derivation of damage-dependent fragility functions is outlined and presented through a case study. A more conventional back-to-back IDA analysis is also carried out in order to compare the derived damage-dependent fragility functions with the ones obtained with the proposed procedure. The results indicate that record selection remains a crucial factor even when assessing the structural vulnerability of damaged buildings, and should thus be treated cautiously.",Mainshock-consistent ground motion record selection for aftershock sequences,2020,aftershock risk; damage accumulation; damage-dependent fragility functions; ground motion record selection; mainshock-aftershock sequences,STEEL FRAME BUILDINGS; CONDITIONAL SPECTRUM; PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; FRAGILITY CURVES; SEISMIC RISK; INTENSITY; COMPONENTS; ALGORITHM; DEMAND; HAZARD,0,0
13097,"Seismic risk assessment of a template school across Nepal is carried out to evaluate the suitability of a single design structure across an area with variable seismic hazard. Many non-governmental organisations (NGOs) use template designs for buildings as a method of reducing design costs; this results in a single seismic design used over a large area. Such an approach is particularly popular in Nepal as the government requires that all school designs obtain approval from the Department of Education. Probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) studies have shown a varying seismic hazard across Nepal with the PGA a 475-year return event ranging from 0.05 g to 0.73 g. Pahar trust, a charity that builds schools in Nepal, provided the design of a reinforced concrete (RC) structure with masonry infills. Finite element (FE) models and fragility curves are developed with and without the masonry infill as to explore the effect of masonry infills on the seismic risk. The hazard and the fragility are then integrated to find the seismic risk of the template school across Nepal. The damage distribution is then evaluated for the template school under a 475-year and 2475-year earthquake. The probability of the school exceeding damage limitation (DL) and life safety (LS) has significant geographic variation, with a 475-year earthquake causing the school to exceed DL in most locations and a 2475-year return earthquake causing the school to exceed LS in the majority of locations. The structural contribution of infills brings the risk level below the threshold typically employed as reference in Europe. © 2020",Mapping the seismic safety of RC “template schools” in Nepal,2020,Fragility; Gorkha; Nepal; NGO; RC with Infill; School,None,0,0
13098,"Landslides are widespread natural hazards that generate considerable damage and economic losses worldwide. Detecting terrain movements caused by these phenomena and characterizing affected urban areas is critical to reduce their impact. Here we present a fast and simple methodology to create maps of vulnerable buildings affected by slow-moving landslides, based on two parameters: (1) the deformation rate associated to each building, measured from Sentinel-1 SAR data, and (2) the building damage generated by the landslide movement and recorded during a field campaign.

13100,"Partial collapse of masonry facades during past strong earthquakes is well documented together with the increased vulnerability due to the presence of thermo-insulation within double wythe masonry. The combined seismic and energy retrofit of existing aged buildings represents a topic of importance for the building stock. The current study investigates the in-plane performance of a specific thermo-insulation scheme with panels attached on the external facades of multistory buildings. Diagonal compression tests of prototype specimens are done to study the influence of thermal insulation on the in-plane behaviour of clay brick masonry panels with or without thermal insulation. It was found that the thermo insulating attachment of the tested type performs in a satisfactory way when subjected to the stress field that arises to these masonry panels when subjected to diagonal compression. The thermo insolating panels, although finally debonded from the masonry substrate, do not collapse, even when the masonry panel develops large diagonal cracks, due to the presence of the used plastic anchors. The presence of such thermo insulating attachments leads to an increase of the in-plane load capacity and to a less brittle behaviour than the one without this thermo-insulation. This may also lead to a less vulnerable seismic performance than that of the same masonry panel without this thermo insulating attachment, although further validation is needed considering also the out-of-plane performance. The employed numerical modeling was successful in simulating the most important aspects of the in-plane response of the tested masonry wallets with or without thermo-insulating attachments. The good agreement with observed performance as well as the general nature of this numerical simulation confirms its validity. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

13101,"Resilience is an attribute of communities, and is supported by community building sectors (occupancy types) with different functionalities. Evaluating community resilience and functionality requires the establishment of new metrics and their quantification. This study introduces a methodology to consider how the interdependencies in functionality among different building sectors impact community resilience. Four building sectors that provide essential functions to a community, i.e. housing, education, business and public services, are considered. The percentage of people in a community who dislocate following a disaster as a result of the physical damages to buildings is selected as the resilience metric in this conceptual study. A framework is further developed to determine the optimum strategies for retrofitting community building portfolios as a whole in order to achieve an overall community resilience objective expressed in terms of the threshold value of the community resilience metric identified above. Finally, the methodology to quantify community functionality and the associated retrofit optimization algorithm are illustrated using a simplified hypothetical community building portfolio in China exposed to potentially severe earthquakes, in which the objective is to achieve a predetermined functionality level when financial constraints may be present.

13102,"There will be a lot of pollution in the process of production and degradation of rubber. It is imperative to recycle rubber in order to build a green and saving environment. A new kind of mortar with rubber particles is an effective way to reuse the used rubber products. The crumb rubber mortar effectively resist external stress through its own deformation. Therefore, it is of practical significance to study the strength behavior of crumb rubber mortar. The stress-strain curves of crumb rubber mortars with 5 different rubber contents under a triaxial stress condition are obtained through laboratory testing. The internal variation law of the elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio and damage variable are analyzed, and the necessity of incorporating the influence of the damage threshold into the damage evolution model is discussed. According to a rock damage model based on Lemaitre's strain equivalence theory and the introduction of the damage threshold based on the traditional Weibull random distribution, the damage constitutive model of crumb rubber mortars under the influence of the damage threshold is established by considering two factors. The method of determining the model parameters is presented. The model can describe the entire process of strain softening and deformation of crumb rubber mortars for various levels of rubber content or confining pressure. The model can also fully reflect the linear elastic deformation characteristics of rock under small deformations and the nonlinear mechanical behavior after the peak strength is exceeded. The model is particularly suitable for describing the complex stress states in the field of underground engineering, and it provides a reference for the design of supporting structures. Finally, by comparing the measured results of three-axis compression tests of crumb rubber mortars with various rubber contents, the rationality of the model is verified. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

13103,"In seismic risk estimation, among the different types of fragility curves used (judgement-based, mechanical, empirical/observational, hybrid), the mechanical ones have the twofold ad-vantage of allowing a better control over the basic parameters and of representing a validation test of the consistency of empirical/observational ones. In this study, fragility curves of RC frames with column-driven failures are obtained from a simplified analytical pushover method implemented in a simple spreadsheet, thus allowing the user to perform a large number of analyses. More im-portantly, the proposed method introduces the concept that Limit States at the structural level are obtained consequent to the attainment of the same Limit States at the local level, in the columns’ sections. This avoids using additional criteria, such as interstorey drift thresholds. This simple analytical model allows for rapid development of fragility curves, for any Limit State, of different building typologies identified by a set of global quantities (number of storeys, story heights, number of spans and span lengths) and by a set of local quantities (element sizes, reinforcement, and material properties). It also allows for a straightforward treatment of the influence of the soil class on the fragility curves parameters, which is another critical issue addressed in this work that helps when interpreting some literature results using empirical/observational methods. © 2021 by the author.

13106,"The assessment of seismic harm is today just about solely focused around visual examination, as building managers are for the most part hesitant to introduce perpetual sensing frameworks, because of their high establishment, administration and upkeep costs. To defeat this impediment, in this paper we introduce little size sensing nodes for estimation of strain and acceleration, coordinating Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) based sensors. The sensors transmit data wirelessly to a remote acquisition unit where data are stored, processed and interpreted using the developed software. This software consists of a damage assessment module and a decision support module, providing respectively an estimation of the level of damage inside the building and an insight of the rehabilitation methodologies and cost.

13107,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery has recently emerged as a promising alternative for operational condition inspection and postdisaster damage assessment of civil structures (e.g., bridges and buildings). However, the use of such sensing techniques for quantitatively tracking the subtle (centimeter-level) variations of the responses of structures has been limited. This is largely due to the difficulties related to obtaining accurate location measurements of the cameras aboard small UAV platforms. To address this research gap, we propose a video analysis methodology for tracking the displacement response of buildings subject to dynamic loads using camera-equipped UAV platforms. The movement of the image sensor on-board the UAV platform is corrected to allow image-by-image natural feature detection and tracking. In this methodology, the image processing procedure does not rely on the camera position and orientation. As such, the approach first corrects for image distortion introduced by UAV drift and subsequently extracts the dynamic displacements of the building by tracking its natural features at the pixel level. Motion-tracking errors are investigated by analyzing the building displacements using pre- and postevent videos. The proposed methodology is validated by monitoring the dynamic response of a full-scale building during a shake table test program. Uniquely, global positioning system (GPS) displacement measurements are independently utilized to validate the proposed UAV video-based method and assess its effectiveness for capturing the dynamic responses of full-scale structures with a level of precision that is sufficient for engineering applications (less than 2 cm root-mean-square errors).",Methodology and Validation of UAV-Based Video Analysis Approach for Tracking Earthquake-Induced Building Displacements,2020,Feature detection; Motion tracking; Photogrammetry; Shake table tests; Unmanned aerial vehicles; Vision-based sensing,None,0,0
13108,"The increasing attention of governments and insurance companies toward the evaluation of tsunamis' impacts on coastal communities led to a renewed interest in assessing the behavior of existing buildings under onshore tsunami flows. Codes and standards regulating assessment procedures for existing structures under tsunami loading are currently missing, and only a few design codes for vertical evacuation shelters can be found. Furthermore, structural analysis methods currently assume watertight buildings for the assessment of their performance under tsunami inundation. In this work, a methodology for assessing the performance of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings that considers explicitly the progressive failure of exterior breakaway infill walls hit by tsunami flows is proposed. The effects of the progressive failure of breakaway infill walls on the overall performance of RC buildings have been highlighted on case-study buildings representative of low-, midand high-rise buildings built before the 1980s in the Mediterranean area, characterized by masonry infill walls with low out-of-plane (OOP) capacity. In the absence of specific guidelines for assessment, load models provided by existing tsunami design codes for evacuation buildings were adopted and opportunely modified for the case of buildings with breakaway infill walls. The explicit consideration of the failure of exterior breakaway infill walls completely changed the distributions of loads inside the structure, leading to different structural capacity and damage evolution with respect to watertight buildings. The height of the building affected the global capacity but did not influence the damage evolution. The proposed methodology can represent a suitable solution for a realistic performance assessment of frame structures with breakaway claddings.

Knowing this significant contribution, several experimental and verified analytical simulations are developed during the past two decades for partition walls. However, their fragility curves are limited to certain geometries due to the high experimental expenditures and absence of a robust methodology for obtaining these seismic fragility curves from numerical results.

13110,"High wind speeds produced by hurricanes or synoptic winds can cause considerable damage and the failure of structural and nonstructural elements. The use of glass facades in buildings has become very popular; in Mexico, a large number of buildings along the coast are designed with glass facades. Glass facades provide light, temperature control, and an esthetic view; however, this type of glass system is particularly vulnerable to high wind-induced pressures. A methodology to determine the fragility curves of glass facades under turbulent wind loading is proposed. This methodology could be used to select the appropriate glass thickness of a facade. The procedure employs an autoregressive and moving average model to simulate the wind field and Monte Carlo techniques to simulate the glass resistance of the windows. The methodology to construct the fragility curves is illustrated with a numerical example of a glass facade of a 96-m tall building. Three cases of glass resistance associated with coefficients of variation equal to 0, 10, and 20% were considered. The results of the numerical example show that the uncertainty in the glass resistance plays an important role in the development of the fragility curves of the glass facades for high mean wind speeds between 38 and 67 m/s at a height of 10 m.",Methodology to Develop Fragility Curves of Glass Facades Under Wind-Induced Pressure,2019,Glass facade; ARMA model; Wind pressure; Fragility curves; Probability of damage,COST DESIGN CRITERIA; DAMAGE,0,0
13113,"The effectiveness of coastal or inland forests in trapping floating debris produced by destructive tsunamis has long been discussed but never clarified quantitatively. To estimate the effectiveness, especially in reducing the damage to wooden buildings (houses) behind the forest, a nonlinear long wave equation model that includes not only destruction of the coastal forest but also a trap mechanism has been developed, and a simulation was conducted where trapping was observed during the 2011 Great East Japan tsunami. A post-tsunami survey of Sendai City showed that some houses just behind the coastal forest remained, although the inland-side houses were washed out. Based on the damage to houses, fragility curves as a function of moment by fluid force were analyzed. Although only the fringe of a coastal forest increases the fluid force due to a tsunami current concentration where a coastal forest is damaged, analyses using the model with and without the trapping function suggest that the debris-trapping function of a coastal forest greatly mitigates the damage observed in the post-tsunami survey, not only just behind the forest, but further inland, at around 1300 m from the coast. By including the trapping effect, the inundation height can be well reproduced, especially at around 2000–3000 m. The fluid force reduction was increased inland because some houses there remained standing in the tsunami and maintained resistance to the current. © 2016, International Consortium of Landscape and Ecological Engineering and Springer Japan.",Mitigation of destructive fluid force on buildings due to trapping of floating debris by coastal forest during the Great East Japan tsunami,2017,Bioshield; Critical moment; Fragility curve; Trapping effect; Washout,None,0,0
13114,"The 50 m high masonry chimney located in the old industrial facility that houses the School of Engineering of the University of Ferrara, Italy, suffered severe damages during the 2012 Emilia seismic sequence. Afterward, for security reasons, the upper damaged 12.40 m were disassembled. Both before and after shortening, the ratio between the effective mass of the fundamental mode and the total mass is approximately 20%, leading standard pushover analysis methods not to be appropriate for estimating the seismic demand. Using a single, consistent 3D FE formulation, the results of a Modal Pushover Analysis (MPA) and four nonlinear Response History Analyses (RHA) for the shortened and the original chimney were presented in the paper. The ground motions considered in the simulations are accelero-grams recorded during recent and less recent devastating seismic events in Italy, New Zealand, and Japan. For both chimneys, a very good agreement between MPA and RHA was observed in terms of lateral displacements. Moreover, for the 50 m high chimney, a strong similarity was observed between the damage maps deriving from the MPA and those obtained with the RHA. All analyses confirmed a significant contribution of the higher modes. For the shortened chimney, the MPA revealed damages in the lower part of the stack (8-21 m), because of a prevailing influence of the fundamental mode. In the RHA, a more evident contribution of the higher modes was observed, probably because of the effect of the vertical component of the ground motion, not accounted for in the MPA.

13115,"Numerous existing building structures around the world were constructed without seismic provisions. Reinforced concrete columns in these buildings feature shortcomings (e.g., shorter lap splices, splices located in the plastic hinge zone, and minimal confinement) which increase their seismic vulnerabilities. To assess the seismic risk associated with these structures, this study proposes a numerical model to capture the nonlinear behavior of barslip in lap splices and applies the model to non-ductile building frames. To this end, an experimental database consisting of 28 rectangular specimens exhibiting lap-splice failure prior to yielding is constructed and then used to calibrate the numerical model to optimize the model parameters. The proposed model correlates strongly with the existing experimental data. The seismic damage potential of non-ductile frames is evaluated by developing their fragility curves. The selected building frames feature three stories with different lap-splice lengths and continuous longitudinal reinforcement in the plastic hinge zone. Fragility results indicate that increasing the lapsplice length in the plastic hinge zone decreases the frame vulnerability.",Model development and seismic performance evaluation of rectangular reinforced concrete columns with short lap splices in existing building frames,2021,Lap-splice failure; Rectangular reinforced concrete column; Numerical model development; Experimental database; Seismic fragility,BOND-CRITICAL REGIONS; RC COLUMNS; FRAGILITY CURVES; BRIDGE COLUMNS; GROUND-MOTION; STRENGTH; BEHAVIOR; POLYMER; COLLAPSE; RETROFIT,0,0
13116,"Numerical finite element analysis is considered a reliable tool for response assessment of structures under extreme loadings. When developing finite element models, various geometrical and behavioral assumptions are typically made to simplify the modeling approach and to save on computational cost. The effect of these assumptions on analysis results, however, could be substantial and might significantly alter the decisions pertaining to design, assessment, or retrofit of the structure considered. The importance of accurate modeling, particularly of critical infrastructures, can be vital for post-disaster recovery management following an extreme event. In this study, the seismic response of a six-story hospital building with buckling-restrained braces, located in Memphis, Tennessee, is evaluated for different modeling resolution levels. Different pushover and non-linear time-history analyses are conducted to understand, compare, and evaluate the seismic performance of the structure using both 2-D and 3-D numerical models with and without soil. Various nonlinear features are considered in the simulations including realistic hysteretic behavior of the connections, buckling-restrained braces, and soil-foundation-structure interaction. The results highlight the importance of including representative member and connection models as well as realistic boundary conditions, while employing 3-D simulations, for accurate predictions of system response.

13117,"Special concentrically braced steel framed (SCBF) system is one of the popular lateral seismic resistant systems used for buildings. Modeling of SCBF involves several sources of epistemic uncertainties such as the low-cycle fatigue input parameters. Low-cycle fatigue induced fracture of braces is critical in controlling the seismic response and resiliency of SCBF structures. Thus, it is important to better quantify and investigate the influence of modeling parameters on the seismic response of SCBF systems under earthquake motions. An extensive analytical study is conducted using OpenSees to study the modeling sensitivity, and in turn, generate fragility curves for two simple configurations of one-story one-bay SCBF under two sets of ground motions that have varying duration. Different modeling parameters are treated deterministically as sources of uncertainties and Tornado Diagram Analysis is used to rank these sources of uncertainty in SCBF modeling. All the analysis results are integrated to develop two sets of fragility curves under short and long duration earthquakes. The results shows that the estimated median collapse capacity is 45% lower when using the long duration set, as compared to the short duration set and using the drift capacity as the seismic intensity measure. A reduction in the obtained drift capacity of about 7% is also observed on average for every 10 seconds increase in the ground motion significant duration increase, which reflects a premature failure than what is intended from design. © 11th National Conference on Earthquake Engineering 2018.

13119,"Masonry structures, although classically suitable to withstand gravitational loads, are sensibly vulnerable if subjected to extraordinary actions such as earthquakes, exhibiting cracks even for events of moderate intensity compared to other structural typologies like as reinforced concrete or steel buildings. In the last half-century, the scientific community devoted a consistent effort to the computational analysis of masonry structures in order to develop tools for the prediction (and the assessment) of their structural behavior. Given the complexity of the mechanics of masonry, different approaches and scales of representation of the mechanical behavior of masonry, as well as different strategies of analysis, have been proposed. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the existing modeling strategies for masonry structures, as well as a novel classification of these strategies are presented. Although a fully coherent collocation of all the modeling approaches is substantially impossible due to the peculiar features of each solution proposed, this classification attempts to make some order on the wide scientific production on this field. The modeling strategies are herein classified into four main categories: block-based models, continuum models, geometry-based models, and macroelement models. Each category is comprehensively reviewed.

13120,"Hurricane-induced coastal floods pose a significant threat to near-shore communities for the United States and many other coastal areas around the world. Various mitigation measures have been developed to reduce infrastructure vulnerability. This paper proposes an engineering-based method to evaluate the influence of different flood mitigation strategies on residential structural vulnerability. The mitigation strategies studied are floor elevation, the elevation of utilities, wet floodproofing, and dry floodproofing. A probabilistic damage and cost analysis of building components is employed to modify existing fragility functions of unmitigated structures. The coastal flood fragility functions are then translated into vulnerability functions to express the mean damage ratio as a function of the hazard intensity, reflecting the influence of the mitigation measures. To evaluate the effectiveness of the strategy, the mitigated results are compared with the vulnerability functions of unmitigated residential structures. The proposed method is designed to incorporate independent calibration data from damage assessments readily and claims analyses and provides a useful tool to help decision-makers assess coastal flood mitigation measures on a quantitative basis. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Modeling the Influence of Flood Mitigation Measures on the Vulnerability of Coastal Residential Construction,2021,Coastal flood damage; Hurricanes; Mitigation measures; Risk prediction model,Damage detection; Decision making; Function evaluation; Housing; Flood mitigation measures; Flood mitigation strategies; Infrastructure vulnerabilities; Mitigation measures; Probabilistic damage; Residential construction; Residential structures; Structural vulnerability; Floods; coastal zone; flood control; measurement method; modeling; vulnerability,0,0
13123,"This paper presents a constitutive relationship to describe the uniaxial response in statics of brick and mortar samples of Adobe, a traditional masonry whose components are made of sundried soil mixture reinforced with fibres. Only recently Adobe has been attracting scientific attention, primarily as a consequence of the dramatic failures these structures have suffered in regions prone to earthquakes. Furthermore, it possesses eco-friendly material properties which are attractive features for western countries forced to reduce the environmental impact of modern building industry. Nevertheless, the mechanical properties of Adobe are still largely neglected, especially with regards to the influence of soil mixture components. The study of the structural performance of masonry starts from the assessment of the material performance of its components. Thus, an extensive characterization campaign was performed by Delft University of Technology and the Military Engineering Laboratory of the Netherlands. Three types of bricks and one type of mortar with different mixture components proportions, were subjected to granulometry, moisture content, density tests and uniaxial compressive and three point bending tests. Predictive formulations for compressive and tensile strength and deformation values have been proposed by the authors. These relations include the dependency of mixture components and moisture content. In this paper, constitutive laws are developed for Adobe in pure compression and tension validated by experimental results. In compression, the force-displacement curves were interpolated according to several existing constitutive laws and the model originally developed by Priestley for concrete masonry elements was finally selected as best fitting. Despite the differences in terms of mechanical parameters, the analytical assessment revealed that the experimental force-displacement graphs of all the different types of bricks could be interpolated using the same model with the same calibrating values. Furthermore, the uniaxial response in tension was derived according to an inverse approach. A numerical model recently developed by the authors and calibrated with respect to the compressive and bending tests was used to simulate uniaxial tensile tests. Also in tension, a common trend among types was observed. The results of the constitutive modelling frames components of Adobe within the class of quasi brittle (geo)materials, with particular reference to concrete.

13124,"ASCE 7-10 introduced new seismic design maps that define risk-targeted ground motions such that buildings designed according to these maps will have 1% chance of collapse in 50 years. These maps were developed by iterative risk calculation, wherein a generic building collapse fragility curve is convolved with the U.S. Geological Survey hazard curve until target risk criteria are met. Recent research shows that this current approach may be unconservative at locations where the tectonic environment is much different than that used to develop the generic fragility curve. This study illustrates how risk-targeted ground motions at selected sites would change if generic building fragility curve and hazard assessment were modified to account for seismic risk from subduction earthquakes and near-fault pulses.

13125,"Accurate monitoring of the developing process of a surface subsidence basin is the basis of building damage assessment and surface deformation prediction. In this paper, the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data of three different imaging geometries, TerraSAR, Radarsat-2, and Sentinel-1A, were exploited. Firstly, two-dimensional (2D) time-series deformation of the surface subsidence basin caused by 15,235 working face mining was obtained based on Multidimensional Small Baseline Subset (MSBAS) technology from 19 December 2015 to 5 March 2016. By comparing vertical deformation with levelling data, it is shown that the root-mean-square error of vertical deformation is 3.2 mm and the standard deviation is 1.9 mm when the ascending-descending track SAR data is available. Otherwise, the root-mean-square error of vertical deformation is 18.1 mm and the standard deviation is 11.6 mm. Because of the low precision of the north–south horizontal movement monitored by the SAR sensor, the vertical deformation acquired by MSBAS technology and the rules of the mining subsidence (horizontal movement is proportional to tilt) were combined to obtain the north–south horizontal movement which was proven to be reliable by comparing the 2D time-series deformation obtained by MSBAS technology. Then, the deformation of the railway in the surface subsidence basin was analysed based on the three-dimensional (3D) time-series deformation. The results show that the subsidence, tilt, and horizontal movement strongly influence the railway in the monitoring period, but will not affect the normal traffic. This experiment lays a technical foundation for preventing the occurrence of mining disasters and verifies the ability to monitor the deformation of buildings and structures by interferometry synthetic aperture radar technology. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Monitoring and analysis of mining 3D time-series deformation based on multi-track SAR data,2019,None,Cutting machines (mining); Damage detection; Deformation; Disaster prevention; Mean square error; Railroads; Subsidence; Technology transfer; Time series; Time series analysis; Horizontal movements; Interferometry synthetic aperture radars; Monitoring and analysis; Root mean square errors; Small baseline subsets; Threedimensional (3-d); Two Dimensional (2 D); Vertical deformation; Synthetic aperture radar; accuracy assessment; deformation; disaster management; mining; monitoring; RADARSAT; satellite data; Sentinel; subsidence; synthetic aperture radar; TerraSAR-X; three-dimensional modeling; time series,0,0
13126,"We propose a novel approach for rapid segmentation of flooded buildings by fusing multiresolution, multisensor, and multitemporal satellite imagery in a convolutional neural network. Our model significantly expedites the generation of satellite imagery-based flood maps, crucial for first responders and local authorities in the early stages of flood events. By incorporating multitemporal satellite imagery, our model allows for rapid and accurate post-disaster damage assessment and can be used by governments to better coordinate medium-and long-term financial assistance programs for affected areas. The network consists of multiple streams of encoder-decoder architectures that extract spatiotemporal information from medium-resolution images and spatial information from high-resolution images before fusing the resulting representations into a single medium-resolution segmentation map of flooded buildings. We compare our model to state-of-the-art methods for building footprint segmentation as well as to alternative fusion approaches for the segmentation of flooded buildings and find that our model performs best on both tasks. We also demonstrate that our model produces highly accurate segmentation maps of flooded buildings using only publicly available medium-resolution data instead of significantly more detailed but sparsely available very high-resolution data. We release the first open-source dataset of fully preprocessed and labeled multiresolution, multispectral, and multitemporal satellite images of disaster sites along with our source code.","Multi(3)Net: Segmenting Flooded Buildings via Fusion of Multiresolution, Multisensor, and Multitemporal Satellite Imagery",2019,None,None,0,0
13127,"Assessing disaster impacts is the pathway to attain informed decision making to mitigate damages. Currently, these impacts are generally analyzed excluding the environmental consequences of disasters. Thus, this study proposes a novel quantitative method, named multi-dimensional damage assessment (MDDA), that integrates the disaster-related environmental impacts with economic and social losses. For this, Life Cycle Assessment was used to measure environmental impacts at the endpoint level for the human health area of protection. The unit of assessment used to merge the three damage dimensions was the disability-adjusted life year equivalent (DALYeq). The damages exerted by floods in Peru linked to El Nino in recent decades were selected as the main case study. Furthermore, other natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes) were included in the assessment for the sake of comparability. The results show that El Nino floods in Peru in 1982-83 and 1997-98 presented higher damage per capita, approximately 2.8 times higher, than the event in 2017. Additionally, the assessment showed that economic damages are the most relevant in El Nino floods, whereas social damages are those prevalent for earthquakes. The results demonstrate that MDDA is an effective measurement for the purpose of damage comparison and, therefore, to implement mitigation strategies. The proposed methodology will allow the development of disaster risk mitigation strategies that will cover all damage dimensions and enable the adoption of improved public policies. Finally, MDDA can be applied to compute any complex array of damages that humans may suffer or infringe as a consequence of their interaction with the environment.",Multi-dimensional damage assessment (MDDA): A case study of El Nino flood disasters in Peru,2021,DALY; Disaster damage; Disaster risk assessment; Environmental damage; Life cycle assessment,ADJUSTED LIFE YEARS; NATURAL-RESOURCES; IMPACT; PROTECTION; CLIMATE; BURDEN; AREA,0,0
13128,"Tsunami damage on buildings in regions subjected to shaking is commonly modeled disregarding the occurrence of a previous earthquake and damages that have already occurred at those buildings. In Portugal, there are studies for the regions of Lisboa, Setúbal and Algarve that access damages or vulnerability of buildings due to the action of tsunami waves. Even so, they never took into account that, if near to the epicenter, usually prior to the tsunami, there was an earthquake shaking capable of provoking some level of damages to the building stock in the affected area. In this paper, we propose a way of combining earthquake shaking damages with tsunami damages – the aggregated damage. This is defined as an additive function. The aggregated damage of a building is the sum of damages caused by the earthquake plus those caused by the tsunami. As for earthquake shaking damage assessment, we use a home-developed software model based on standard vulnerability indexes conveying fragility curves for 5 different damage states (DSi), for reinforced concrete and other building typologies (only masonry is considered in the present case). The tsunami fragility curves corresponding to similar DSi, were obtained from recent published literature where the main variable was the water maximum height reaching each building which was estimated using a Geographic Information System (GIS) approach. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Multi-hazard analysis of earthquake shaking and tsunami impact,2018,Aggregated damages; Damages; Earthquake; GIS; Simulator; Tsunami,None,0,0

Earthquake-induced ground shaking, ground failure (e.g., landslides and liquefaction), and tsunami inundation fragility functions are combined with regional hazard data to estimate the damage to bridges in a highway network, direct economic loss, and reduction in traffic capacity. The proposed framework is applied to all bridges listed in the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) and located in the state of Oregon for several earthquake scenarios developed for the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. A parametric study is performed to understand the sensitivity of economic loss and postearthquake traffic capacity with respect to various fragility function classes as well as the parameters defining these fragility curves. Results show that the predicted damage varies substantially depending on the class of fragility function used. In addition, the loss estimates show significant sensitivity with respect to parameters defining the fragility functions, particularly the resistance models, emphasizing the need to develop specific and systematic regional fragility curves for bridges. The results also indicate that when ground failure and tsunami inundation are jointly considered, there is a significant increase in the loss estimates when compared to the estimates obtained from when ground shaking is considered alone.",Multihazard Damage and Loss Assessment of Bridges in a Highway Network Subjected to Earthquake and Tsunami Hazards,2021,Bridge; Bridge network; Cascadia subduction zone; Fragility; HAZUS-MH; Multihazard; Seismic loss assessment; Sensitivity; Tsunami; Uncertainty,STRUCTURAL RESPONSE ESTIMATION; SEISMIC FRAGILITY CURVES; RISK-ASSESSMENT; SCALAR IMS; VECTOR; CHARLESTON,0,0
13131,"Increments of the axial capacity of existing masonry elements can be provided by confinement. Assessment methodologies with general validity to assess the behavior of confined masonry columns with strengthening systems are not available in the technical literature, in fact, the strong variability and heterogeneity of masonry material did not allow to develop generalized models. For brittle materials damage mechanics and failure criteria allow to do this in the framework of solid mechanics. However, the recent scientific researches provided relevant information about the experimental behavior of masonry confined with composites. In this paper, an analytical model able to assess the behavior of the confined masonry with composite is proposed. It was developed according to a failure criterion based on mechanical parameters representative of masonry. It can be applied to masonry cross sections of any shape also under a non-uniform lateral stress field (i.e. generic stress fields). To confirm the flexibility of the proposed model some existing experimental results have been used. The comparison between model predictions and experimental results in terms of axial strength showed that the proposed model is a valid tool to assess the confinement properties of strengthened masonry elements.

13132,"Deterioration of reinforced concrete infrastructure such as bridges, tunnels, and buildings represents one of the major challenges currently facing developed countries. This deterioration leads to economie casts for maintenance and replacement, environmental impacts such as increased global warming potential as a result of cement production and traffic emissions, and social casts related to traffic congestion and human health concerns. While engineering tools and methods for structural modelling and design of new reinforced concrete infrastructure are mature, the methods and tools for modelling decades-long deterioration and maintenance are much less developed. An approach for modelling structural deterioration of reinforced concrete components due to reinforcement corrosion is presented and a procedure is introduced to estimate the time-dependent structural response, described using time-dependent seismic fragility curves. The approach is part of a multi-disciplinary framework which includes physical, chemical, and electrochemical processes at the meso-scale coupled with mechanical deterioration processes, which are modelled using finite element methods, at the macro-scale.

13139,"To achieve risk-based engineered structural designs that provide safety for life and property from tornadoes, sufficient knowledge of tornado wind speeds and wind flow characteristics is needed. Currently, sufficient understanding of the magnitude, frequency, and velocity structure of tornado winds remain elusive. Direct measurements of tornado winds are rare and nearly impossible to acquire, and the pursuit of in situ wind measurements can be precarious, dangerous, and even necessitating the development of safer and more reliable means to understand tornado actions. Remote-sensing technologies including satellite, aerial, lidar, and photogrammetric platforms, have demonstrated an ever-increasing efficiency for collecting, storing, organizing, and communicating tornado hazards information at a multitude of geospatial scales. Current remote-sensing technologies enable wind-engineering researchers to examine tornado effects on the built environment at various spatial scales ranging from the overall path to the neighborhood, building, and ultimately member and/or connection level. Each spatial resolution contains a unique set of challenges for efficiency, ease, and cost of data acquisition and dissemination, as well as contributions to the body of knowledge that help engineers and atmospheric scientists better understand tornado wind speeds. This paper examines the use of remote sensing technologies at four scales in recent tornado investigations, demonstrating the challenges of data collection and processing at each level as well as the utility of the information gleaned from each level in advancing the understanding of tornado effects. © 2018 Womble, Wood and Mohammadi.",Multi-scale remote sensing of tornado effects,2018,Damage assessment; Imagery; Lidar; Photogrammetry; SAR; Tornado damage; UAS,None,0,0
13140,"Landslides are one of the most relevant geohazards worldwide, causing direct and indirect costs and fatalities. Italy is one of the countries most affected by mass movements, and the Molise region, southern Italy, is known to be susceptible to erosional processes and landslides. In January 2003, a landslide in the municipality of Agnone, in the Colle Lapponi-Piano Ovetta (CL-PO) territory, occurred causing substantial damage to both structures and civil infrastructure. To investigate the evolution of the landslide-affected catchment over approximately one century, different data were taken into account: (i) literature information at the beginning of the twentieth century; (ii) historical sets of aerial optical photographs to analyse the geomorphological evolution from 1945 to 2003; (iii) SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data from the ERS1/2, ENVISAT and COSMO-SkyMed satellites to monitor the displacement from 1992 to 2015; (iv) traditional measurements carried out through geological and geomorphological surveys, inclinometers and GPS campaigns to characterize the geological setting of the area; and (v) recent optical photographs of the catchment area to determine the enlargement of the landslide. Using the structure from motion technique, a 3D reconstruction of each set of historical aerial photographs was made to investigate the geomorphological evolution and to trace the boundary of the mass movements. As a result, the combination of multitemporal and multitechnique analysis of the evolution of the CL-PO landslide enabled an assessment of the landslide expansion, which resulted in a maximum length of up to approximately 1500m. A complete investigation of the past and present deformational sequences of the area was performed to potentially plan further mitigation and prevention strategies to avoid possible reactivations.","Multisource data integration to investigate one century of evolution for the Agnone landslide (Molise, southern Italy)",2018,Landslide evolution; Structure from motion; Geomorphology; A-DInSAR; Molise,PERMANENT SCATTERERS; AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS; TIME-SERIES; INTERFEROMETRY; RECONSTRUCTION; METHODOLOGY; MAPS; UAV,0,0
13141,"In this study, the performance at failure of old multi-tiered temples in Nepal under horizontal loads mimicking a seismic action has been addressed using three different computational approaches, including a) linear elastic; b) nonlinear static; and c) nonlinear dynamic analyses. Also, a sensitivity study was undertaken to understand the influence of wall thickness and height of Nepalese temples on their behavior at failure. Vertical oscillating modes using the elastic response spectrum of the Nepalese Building Code were obtained using linear analysis. Nonlinear static analysis (NLSA) were implemented to obtain the load carrying capacities of different in geometry temples e.g. different thickness of central core walls and number of tiers. Additionally, nonlinear dynamic analysis (NLDA) using the Finite Element Method (FEM) were performed to evaluate the characteristic tensile damage patterns. The results comparatively indicate the weakest zones depending on wall thickness, central core slenderness, opening distribution, boxlike confinement, vertical misalignment of walls and so forth. Also, the results of the NLDA affirm high vulnerability of the multi-tiered temples showing extensive cracks at relatively low peak ground accelerations.

13145,"This paper reports the study of the effects on structural seismic resilience of near fault pulse-like ground motions recorded in the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. Some near fault pulse-like and far fault nonpulse-like ground motions recorded in the Wenchuan earthquake were selected as excitations for nonlinear dynamic analysis. A low-ductile reinforced concrete frame and a modern ductile frame were considered to compare seismic resilience of frames constructed before and after the Wenchuan earthquake. The building-based loss evaluation approach in HAZUS was modified to explicitly consider the effect of residual story drifts, which provides an accurate loss evaluation method and still retains simplicity. Fragility curves were derived from incremental dynamic analysis. Loss vulnerability curves for frames were obtained based on the proposed method. Functionality restoration curves and resilience index were then estimated. The results show that the Wenchuan near fault pulse-like ground motions can induce higher collapse and demolition risks for frames. Total losses of frames are higher under pulse-like ground motions, and the resilience of frames is reduced. Ignoring residual story drifts will underestimate total losses, especially for frames under pulse-like ground motions. Finally, the modern ductile frame shows enhanced earthquake resilience compared with the low-ductile frame.",Near fault ground motion effects on seismic resilience of frame structures damaged in Wenchuan earthquake,2020,Seismic resilience; pulse-like ground motions; low-ductile frame; seismic loss; residual story drifts; seismic hazard,FRAGILITY CURVES; MOMENT FRAMES; CONCRETE; PERFORMANCE; MODEL; PREDICTION; BUILDINGS; COLUMNS; ELEMENT; SYSTEMS,0,0
13146,"During earthquake emergencies in existing city-centers, streets network permits inhabitants to reach safe areas, and rescuers to access damaged zones and help population. However, the network can suffer from blocks due to debris of collapsed or heavily damaged buildings. Understanding urban fabric modifications and classifying elements vulnerability are fundamental steps while dealing with risk-assessment and risk-reduction strategies. This article offers a first quick approach for assessing seismic vulnerability of paths network by considering interferences with building heritage damages. Quick data about existing urban fabric (e.g., buildings typology; streets and buildings geometries) are combined for developing new vulnerability indices for streets network. The earthquake macroseismic intensity is introduced for evaluating probable street blockages and summarizing the overall rating of risks in critical network locations, thus intensity that is not included in other current quick methods for streets-building interference is here taken into account. Risk-reduction strategies based on the proposed indices could minimize the interventions on architectural heritage, maximizing the safety of evacuees.

Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) has become a valuable data source for urban data acquisition. A method was proposed in this research for building extraction based on object oriented classification with decision rules. A model has been developed using object oriented classification and is implemented using QGIS. Using Lastools, Envi 5.1 and QGIS 2.10, multiple images were derived from LiDAR data. A total of 30 feature attributes have been generated only 8 of the 30 possible attributes were used, resulted in a classification based on the total group of attributes (raw 3D point clouds data captured by laser scanning and LiDAR-derived features (Digital Surface Model and Digital Terrain Model, textures from Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix) as well as the area of building≥ a threshold and building shape has been also used. Three classes were identified for the study area: Building, trees and power lines. The proposed method was evaluated using some buildings of used data set and the results proved high efficiency and reliability of the proposed method for extraction of buildings. The results show that the proposed method has very high classification accuracy. Particularly, the overall classification accuracy was 92%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.93. Additionally, both producer accuracy and user accuracy were higher than 86% for buildings class.

13148,"Assessment of steel damage is one of the key methods in retrofitting and reconstruction of the steel structures after fire. The traditional assessment method is to cut the samples from the steel members and check the levels of damage. This method will damage the structural members and the process is time consuming. In this paper, a quick, simple and efficient nondestructive detection method to measure the strength of steel after fire is developed using so called Leeb hardness method by means of establishment the relationship between the residual strength of steel members after fire and the Leeb hardness, the post-fire steel strength can be fast determined without damage to the structural members. In this paper, in total 120 Chinese H-shaped steel sections were selected for testing the Leeb hardness after fire. The influence of the parameters such as the duration of the fire exposure, cooling mode, steel grade, stress state and location of the Leeb hardness test on the test results was investigated. The relationship between the steel Leeb hardness and the parameters were developed. In addition, regression functions between the residual strength of steel members after fire and the Leeb hardness was established based on these test results which can accurate predict the residual strength of the steel members after fire, providing the engineers a new fast assessment method for the residual strength of the steel after fire. © 2020, The Author(s).",Nondestructive Post-fire Damage Assessment of Structural Steel Members Using Leeb Harness Method,2020,Cooling mode; Fire exposure; Leeb hardness; Post fire damage assessment; Steel strength,Building materials; Fire hazards; Fires; Hardness; Nondestructive examination; Steel testing; Structural members; Cooling mode; Fire exposures; Nondestructive detection method; Post-fire; Regression function; Steel strength; Structural steel members; Traditional assessment; Damage detection,0,0
13150,"A new neural network (NN) predictive controller (NNPC) algorithm has been developed and tested in the computer simulation of active control of a nonlinear structure. In the present method an NN is used as a predictor. This NN has been trained to predict the future response of the structure to determine the control forces. These control forces are calculated by minimizing the differencebetween the predicted and desired responses via a numerical minimization algorithm. Since the NNPC is very time consuming and not suitable for real-time control, it is then used to train an NN controller. To consider the effectiveness of the controller onprobability of damage, fragility curves are generated. The approach is validated by using simulated response of a 3 story nonlinear benchmark building excited by several historical earthquake records. The simulation results are then compared with a linearquadratic Gaussian (LQG) active controller. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is completely effective in relative displacement reduction.

13151,"A novel biaxial constitutive model and a nonlinear model updating algorithm are proposed and implemented in ABAQUS software for simulating the reinforced concrete (RC) shear walls. First, the proposed model is established using the User Material (UMAT) subroutine to be compatible with the multi-layer shell elements and membrane elements with ABAQUS implicit solver. The modeling scheme, the biaxial and uniaxial constitutive models of concrete, and the uniaxial models of rebars are elaborately illustrated. Second, this research modifies five critical parameters in the developed model to consider the influence of initial cracking and softening of concrete and slip of longitudinal rebars. The modified parameters include the concrete stiffness reduction factor alpha(c) , the concrete compressive softening factor eta(c), the concrete shear softening strain gamma(u) , the steel stiffness reduction factor at initial tensile loading alpha(s) , and the steel stiffness reduction factor at peak load alpha(u) . Third, an optimization algorithm based on the discrete Frechet distance is proposed to quantify and minimize the difference between test results and finite element (FE) simulation results of load-displacement curves. Subsequently, a total of 24 RC shear walls are obtained from the literature, and the optimization method is adopted to obtain the most favorable material constitutive parameters based on the force versus lateral displacement curves. The comparison shows the proposed model with the optimization method predicts high accuracy simulation results for RC shear walls.

13152,"Wood shear wall systems are the primary elements of seismic force-resisting system (SFRS) in virtually all light-frame wood buildings. Wood-frame buildings are unique because their nonstructural wall finishes, such as gypsum wallboard and stucco, provide significant strength and stiffness relative to that of the intended SFRS. Given the fact that nonstructural wall finishes can consist of multiple layered materials, it is essential to understand and characterize their behavior. The development of accurate and robust numerical models to capture the inelastic behavior of individual shear wall systems and buildings comprised of these wall systems is a critical step when performing nonlinear analyses for either design, evaluation, or upgrade of existing buildings using standards such as ASCE 41-13 [(ASCE 2013). ASCE 41-13: Seismic evaluation and retrofit of existing buildings]. In general, existing modeling approaches do not account for the implementation of residual strength and displacement, which have been observed for light-frame wood buildings during shake-table tests. Furthermore, nonlinear representation of elements in the ASCE 41 standard considers only cyclic envelopes to define the nonlinear response of wood shear wall systems and not full hysteretic properties. To address these challenges, this study was divided into three main parts. The first part focused on the development of an excessive synthesis of wall assembly tests incorporating different wood sheathing materials and material combinations, and the evaluation of their force-displacement response. The second part introduced a new envelope curve proposed for modeling wood-frame wall systems with the parameters of this curve identified for the different material combinations included in the synthesis of Step 1. Finally, the proposed backbone curve was implemented in a case study of a multifamily wood frame building subjected to seismic excitation. Incremental dynamic analyses were conducted considering both the proposed envelope curve and the ASCE 41 modeling recommendations, and the response of the building structure was evaluated for three different performance levels (immediate occupancy, life safety, and collapse prevention) through fragility analysis. The main objective of this study was to introduce a beneficial wall-system level modeling tool for nonlinear analysis of light-frame wood buildings as specified in codes and standards in the United States. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Nonlinear Modeling of Wood-Frame Shear Wall Systems for Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering: Recommendations for the ASCE 41 Standard,2018,ASCE 41; Backbone curve; Collapse capacity; Fragility curves; Nonlinear time history analysis; Performance-based earthquake engineering; System level response; Wood shear walls,Earthquake effects; Earthquake engineering; Engineering geology; Prestressed materials; Shear walls; Stiffness; Wood; Wooden buildings; ASCE 41; Backbone curves; Collapse capacities; Fragility curves; Nonlinear time history analysis; Performance-based earthquake engineering; System levels; Wood shear walls; Nonlinear analysis,0,0
13153,"This paper presents the systematic use of numerical analysis as a tool for addressing some of the most common challenges encountered in the structural analysis of complex historical masonry structures, that is, the description of the effects of history-related phenomena and the uncertainty of material properties. The numerical strategy is based on the use of a constitutive model able to describe time-dependent strain accumulation, as well as damaging behavior under different stress states. This constitutive model is combined with a crack-tracking technique to represent tensile crack localization. The numerical model is applied to the study of two important monuments in Spain; the Mallorca Cathedral and the church of the Poblet Monastery. The staged construction analysis of the first case study allows for understanding the reasons of its current deformed condition, that is, critical construction process, strain accumulation given by long-term creep phenomena, and nonlinear geometric effects. The structural analysis of the second case study allows the structural diagnosis of the existing deformation and cracking patterns given by architectural alterations, insufficient buttressing of the naves, and past earthquakes. The application of a probabilistic analysis to the church of the Poblet monastery allows for considering the effects of the uncertainties of material properties and numerical parameters in the seismic vulnerability assessment.

13154,"A performance-based multi-objective design optimization framework for nonlinear/hysteretic multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) structural systems subject to evolutionary stochastic excitation is formulated. The core of the developed framework is an efficient approximate dimension reduction technique based on the concepts of statistical linearization and of stochastic averaging for determining the non-stationary system response amplitude probability density functions (PDFs); thus, computationally intensive Monte Carlo simulations are circumvented. Note that the approach can handle readily stochastic excitations of arbitrary non-separable evolutionary power spectrum (EPS) forms that exhibit strong variability in both the intensity and the frequency content. Further, approximate closed-form expressions are derived for the non-stationary inter-story drift ratio amplitude PDFs corresponding to each and every DOF. In this regard, considering appropriately defined damage measures structural system related fragility curves are determined at a low computational cost as well. Finally, the structural system design optimization problem is formulated as a multi-objective one to be solved by a Genetic Algorithm based approach.

13155,"This study develops a vibration-based damage detection method for shear buildings embedded in soil by evaluating the cumulative changes on curvature of the frequency response of displacements between undamaged and damaged structures. The curvature is calculated through direct differentiation rather than finite difference approximation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is compared with two existing methods through numerical studies. The effects of the severity of damage, level of noise and soil rigidity on the localisation of the single and successive damage scenario are investigated. Observations show that the proposed method is able to correctly localise the structural damage with different severity levels under noise-free conditions and performs better than the existing methods under noise-polluted conditions. In addition, the proposed method behaves robustly in successful predictions when buildings are located at various sites with different soil rigidities. The soil rigidity is also observed to considerably influence the effectiveness of the damage localisation method due to dynamic soil-structure interaction. Therefore, the proposed method may be used to effectively predict the damage location for building structures and can be considered to have a great potential for health monitoring of the life-cycle performance of buildings.",Numerical damage localisation for building systems including dynamic soil-structure interaction,2019,Damage detection; dynamic characteristics; vibration; frequency response function; soil-structure interaction; damage assessment,SEISMIC PERFORMANCE; MODE SHAPE; FREQUENCY; IDENTIFICATION; SIZE,0,0

13158,"The accuracy of the Equivalent Frame Method (EFM) in modelling the seismic non-linear behaviour of unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings is investigated for regular walls (Le. walls with regular openings' distribution) with different pier-to-spandrel geometrical relations. The developed EFM is composed of pier and spandrel elements with spread plasticity to simulate the flexural behaviour and lumped plasticity to simulate the shear behaviour. The investigation focuses on checking, by means of comparison with Finite Element Model (FEM) assumed as reference, the applicability of EFM to existing buildings. These structures are often characterized by geometrical schemes difficult to be represented by ideal frames. To point out the role of the geometrical configuration, the numerical results provided by the two modelling approaches are compared for different representative cases of regular walls characterized by pier-spandrel configurations rather typical in existing URM buildings. In addition to the innovative EFM approach, based on a fiber discretized beam element, also a more traditional approach, based on beam elements with lumped plasticity, is included in the comparative study. The two different EFM approaches were implemented in the software Midas GEN (C) [44], while an open source software was used to implement the FEM (Kratos Multiphysics [59-60]). All the models were used to perform static non-linear analyses under equivalent loading and boundary conditions. The evaluation of EFM and FEM is derived from a comparative simulation of a two-storey URM wall experimentally tested by other researchers. Two alternative approaches are assumed for the definition of piers' effective heights in the EFM, i.e. the models proposed by Dolce [1] and Augenti [2]. The results demonstrate that remarkable differences may be detected in EFM and FEM predictions of the shear capacity and damage mechanisms as a function of pier-spandrel geometrical configurations.

13159,"In recent years, it has been observed that historical unreinforced masonry buildings are the most damaged structures after an earthquake event, mainly due to the degradation of materials and the non symmetric distribution of bearing walls. Its conservation is then important when it represent an architectural artistic asset especially when it is still functional. In this paper, the seismic performance-based assessment developed within the European PERPETUATE project was applied adopting two different modeling strategies, structural element model SEM for macroelements with regular geometric forms and continuum constitutive law model CCLM for arcades. The case of this study is an historical masonry building, considered as a valuable architectural heritage of Mostaganem city in Algeria. The assessment is performed by static non linear analysis of the building assuming that the response of the structure is well described by a set of macroelements that are analyzed separately. Pushover analysis of each bearing wall was implemented using Tremuri software for SEM model and the finite element Ansys software for CCLM model by supposing a micro-modeling of materials.

Here, based on near-field explosion tests of ordinary clay fired brick infilled wall, the numerical simulation of damage and dynamic response of masonry infilled wall under near-field explosion was performed. The applicability of the Load Blast method, the arbitrary Lagrange-Eulerian (ALE) method and the impulse method to simulate near-field explosion load and predict wall damage and dynamic response were verified contrastively. The impulse method was used to further discuss effects of explosion distance, bond strength of mortar interface and building block material model under the same proportional distance. The results showed that in near zone explosion, under the same proportional distance, wall body damage usually increases with increase in explosion distance, and develops from local failure to the overall collapse failure mode; the anti-blast performance of wall body is strengthened with increase in bond strength of block mortar, and it is mainly controlled by shear failure stress; the prediction effect of MAT_BRITTLE_DAMAGE model or MAT_WINFRITH_CONCRETE model is better than that of MAT_SOIL_AND_FOAM model. © 2021, Editorial Office of Journal of Vibration and Shock.

13161,"The advanced design rules and the latest known earthquakes, have imposed a strengthening of reinforced concrete structures. Many research works and practical achievements of the application of the external reinforcement by using FRP composite materials have been particularly developed in the recent years. This type of strengthening seems promising for the seismic reinforcement of buildings. Among of the components of structures that could affect the stability of the structure in case of an earthquake is the reinforced concrete walls, which require in many cases a strengthening, especially in case where the diagonal cracks can be developed. The intent of this paper is to present a numerical simulation of squat reinforced concrete wall strengthened by FRP composite material (carbon fiber epoxy). The intent of this study is to perform finite element model to investigate the effects of such reinforcement in the squat reinforced concrete walls. Taking advantage of a commercial finite element package ABAQUS code, three-dimensional numerical simulations were performed, addressing the parameters associated with the squat reinforced concrete walls. An elasto-plastic damage model material is used for concrete, for steel, an elastic-plastic behavior is adopted, and the FRP composite is considered unidirectional and orthotropic. The obtained results in terms of displacements, stresses, damage illustrate clearly the importance of this strengthening strategy. © 2016, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Numerical simulation of squat reinforced concrete wall strengthened by FRP composite material,2016,Abaqus; damage; FRP composite material; reinforced concrete wall; simulation; squat wall; strengthening,ABAQUS; Carbon; Carbon fibers; Composite materials; Concretes; Earthquakes; Elastoplasticity; Finite element method; Geophysics; Numerical models; Reinforced concrete; Strengthening (metal); Walls (structural partitions); damage; Elastic-plastic behavior; Elasto-plastic damage model; Finite element packages; Reinforced concrete wall; simulation; squat wall; Three-dimensional numerical simulations; Structural design,0,0
13162,"High-rise buildings are extensively built in China, and the structure of these buildings is composed of different types of conventional system of which framed structures are more commonly employed. A new cassette structure with advantageous performance properties is proposed. Static and dynamic numerical simulations were applied to investigate the characteristics of this new structure. First, the components and other details are presented. A comparative analysis was conducted between the cassette structure and traditional structures using eight finite models with fiber elements in three different heights. A static pushover analysis and an incremental dynamic analysis were conducted based on 18 near-ground motion records recommended by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

13163,"This paper presents a numerical study on the cyclic behavior of the vertical bolted joints in low-rise precast concrete buildings. A finite element analysis model was developed for predicting the cyclic behavior of the joints which was proved with the experimental results. A step-by-step procedure was developed to carry out the finite element analysis for the contact analysis in the bolted connections. The developed approach was then applied for a parametric study to investigate the effects of main structural design factors on the joints, including the number of bolts per joint, the compressive strength of concrete, the yield strength and diameter of bolts, the thickness of blocks, the yield strength and thickness of gusset plates, the clearance of bolt as well as the arrangement of bolts in joints. Results show that the number of and the properties of steel bolts both have a significant influence on the connection performances of and the failure modes of the joints. Based on the analysis results, a smiplified model was proposed for predicting the shear capacity of the bolted joints which was expected to improve the design of proposed low-rise precast concrete buildings.",Numerical study on the behaviour of vertical bolted joints for precast concrete wall-based low-rise buildings,2021,Precast concrete structures; Low-rise housings; Bolted joint; Seismic design; Demountable connection,PLASTIC-DAMAGE MODEL; STEEL; PERFORMANCE; CONNECTIONS,0,0
13164,"Earthquake-induced building damage assessment is an indispensable prerequisite for disaster impact assessment, and the increasing availability of high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery has made it possible to construct damaged building inventories soon after earthquakes strike. However, the shortage of pre-seismic SAR datasets and the lack of available building footprint data pose challenges for rapid building damage assessment. Taking advantage of recent advances in machine learning algorithms, this study proposes an object-based building damage assessment methodology that uses only post-event SAR imagery. A Random Forest machine learning-based object classification, a simplified approach to the extraction of built-up areas, was developed and tested on two ALOS2/PALSAR-2 dual polarimetric SAR images acquired in affected areas soon after the 2015 Nepal earthquake. In addition, a series of texture metrics as well as the random scattering metric and reflection symmetry metric were found to significantly enhance classification accuracy. The feature selection was found to have a positive effect on overall performance. Moreover, the proposed Random Forest framework resulted in overall accuracies of 93% with a kappa coefficient of 0.885 when the object scale of 60 × 60 pixels and 15 features were adopted. A comparative experiment with the k-nearest neighbor framework demonstrated that the Random Forest framework is a significant step toward the achievement of a balanced, two-class classification. © 2017, Fuji Technology Press.

13166,"On the 26th of November 2019, an earthquake of moment magnitude 6.4 struck the northwest region of Albania as the result of thrust faulting near the convergent boundary of the Africa and Eurasia plates causing widespread damage to buildings in the city of Durrës and the surrounding areas. Based on the official data from the national authorities, the earthquake caused 51 casualties and 985 million-euro losses, corresponding to 7.5% of the 2018 gross domestic product. This paper summarises field observations made by the Earthquake Engineering Field Investigation Team (EEFIT) after the event. The paper presents an overview of the seismological aspects of the earthquake together with a brief overview of the damage, official loss statistics and the estimated macro- and socio-economic consequences of the event. In addition, it provides a summary of the observed damage to both recent and historical buildings as well as the description of several case studies to illustrate the characteristic damage patterns observed in the main structural typologies of the Albanian building stock. These observations try to identify possible links between the observed damage patterns and the deficiencies in construction practice and use of inappropriate retrofit techniques for historical assets. As many severe damages were observed on modern buildings, this also allows the identification of some gaps and possible areas of development of the current seismic design code. In the end, the lessons learned from the field survey are resumed. © 2021, The Author(s).",Observations from the 26th November 2019 Albania earthquake: the earthquake engineering field investigation team (EEFIT) mission,2021,Albania earthquake; Buildings damage assessment; Field survey; Post-earthquake reconnaissance,Damage detection; Engineering geology; Seismic design; Construction practice; Earthquake engineering field investigation teams; Gross domestic products; Historical buildings; Retrofit techniques; Seismic design code; Socio-economic consequences; Structural typologies; Earthquakes; building; building code; building construction; earthquake damage; earthquake engineering; earthquake magnitude; field survey; observational method; retrogression; seismic design; seismic retrofit; spatiotemporal analysis; Africa; Albania; Eurasia,0,0
13167,"In September 2017, two major earthquakes struck south and central Mexico. These earthquakes produced widespread damage in public and private school infrastructure. In Mexico, all school buildings are classified as essential infrastructure and are expected to attain an immediate occupancy performance level after major earthquakes. However, there is a large variation in the quality of the design and construction practices of these buildings due to age of construction, material quality and availability, and great socioeconomic gaps around the country. In this article, an analysis of the observed damage in public school buildings is presented. The results are analyzed depending on the structural system, construction material, and year of construction. The results showed that damage intensity in seismically designed buildings was significantly lower than that observed in the pre-1985 structures.

13168,"This paper presents the record of damages which were observed in Pakistan due to a strong earthquake on 16 April 2013 in Iran. Mashkel was the nearest town in Pakistan close to the epicentre of earthquake. The damages were documented by a survey team during the visit of Mashkel. The intensity of earthquake in most of the visited areas was found to be VIII on the Modified Mercalli Intensity scale. The infrastructure facilities were undamaged and were operating satisfactorily. On the other hand, heavy damage to adobe buildings was caused by the earthquake. Most of the building failure was resulted by the out-of-plane wall collapse; nearly 40 % adobe buildings were collapsed due to ground shaking in some of the affected areas. Reinforced concrete and cement concrete block masonry buildings performed better than adobe buildings.

13170,"This study identifies efficient earthquake intensity measures (IMs) for seismic performances and fragility evaluations of the reactor containment building (RCB) in the advanced power reactor 1400 (APR1400) nuclear power plant (NPP). The computational model of RCB is constructed using the beam-truss model (BTM) for nonlinear analyses. A total of 90 ground motion records and 20 different IMs are employed for numerical analyses. A series of nonlinear time-history analyses are performed to monitor maximum floor displacements and accelerations of RCB. Then, probabilistic seismic demand models of RCB are developed for each IM. Statistical parameters including coefficient of determination (R2), dispersion (i.e. standard deviation), practicality, and proficiency are calculated to recognize strongly correlated IMs with the seismic performance of the NPP structure. The numerical results show that the optimal IMs are spectral acceleration, spectral velocity, spectral displacement at the fundamental period, acceleration spectrum intensity, effective peak acceleration, peak ground acceleration, A95, and sustained maximum acceleration. Moreover, weakly related IMs to the seismic performance of RCB are peak ground displacement, root-mean-square of displacement, specific energy density, root-mean-square of velocity, peak ground velocity, Housner intensity, velocity spectrum intensity, and sustained maximum velocity.

13171,"This paper aims to study different seismic retrofitting techniques to test the reduction of the seismic vulnerability of unreinforced masonry buildings. Three techniques have been considered in a case study: adding steel or carbon fibre reinforced polymer grids in the walls and steel encirclements in the openings. The performance-based method has been used to that purpose. Nonlinear static analyses have been performed to obtain the capacity and fragility curves, the performance point and the damage level states. Moreover, an analysis of the cost-benefit ratio has been carried out. Results have shown that the three techniques have produced considerable improvements. The addition of encirclements has reduced the deformation resulting in a slight increase of the structure's stiffness.

13172,"The combined seismic and energy retrofit of existing aged buildings represents a topic of importance for the building stock. The current study investigates the out-of-plane performance of a specific type of thermo-insulation scheme with panels attached on the external facades of multistory buildings. The investigation was carried out through flexure tests of prototype masonry specimens. From the comparison of their flexural performance, with or without thermo-insulating attachments, the influence of thermal insulation on the out-of-plane behavior of clay brick masonry is demonstrated. It was found that when the thermo-insulating attachment is in tension from such out-of-plane flexure of the masonry facade it performs in a satisfactory way and gives an increased flexural capacity for the assembly. The thermal insulating panels, although partially debonded from the masonry substrate at a limit-state, do not collapse, even when the masonry panel develops large flexural cracks. This is due to the presence of the used plastic anchors. When the thermo-insulating panel is subjected to compression during such an out-of-plane flexure the resulting increase in the out-of-plane load bearing capacity is relatively small. Based on these observations it can be concluded that such thermo-insulating panels may also lead to a less vulnerable seismic performance than that of the same masonry panel without this type of thermo-insulating attachment. This was also confirmed when the in-plane behavior was considered from a separate investigation already published. The employed numerical modeling was successful in simulating the most important aspects of the out-of-plane response of the tested masonry wallets with or without thermo-insulating attachments. The good agreement with observed performance as well as the general nature of this numerical simulation confirms its validity for further use.",Out-of-Plane Flexure of Masonry Panels with External Thermal Insulation,2021,masonry infills; external thermal insulation composite system (ETICS); seismic and energy upgrading; flexural out-of-plane tests; numerical simulations,PLASTIC-DAMAGE MODEL; INPLANE BEHAVIOR; INFILLED FRAMES; THE-ART; WALLS; PERFORMANCE; STRENGTH; RC,0,0
13173,"Past and recent earthquakes showed the occurrence of Out-Of-Plane (OOP) failures of Unreinforced Masonry (URM) infills in Reinforced Concrete (RC) frames. Such a type of failure, which is promoted by In-Plane (IP) damage (IP/OOP interaction), is dangerous for human life safety and its effects can be associated with the attainment of the Life Safety limit state. In this work, the seismic capacity of Reinforced Concrete buildings at the first OOP collapse is evaluated with a linear analysis based on code provisions and with a procedure based on nonlinear static analysis. More specifically, 16 buildings designed to Eurocodes, different for number of storeys and design Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA), are infilled by two infill layouts different for thickness and masonry properties. For these buildings, the PGA at which the first OOP infill collapse occurs is evaluated by applying two different approaches. The first is based on linear analysis and consists in the simple application of the demand and capacity models currently provided by the Eurocodes. So, it accounts neither for the effect of the IP/OOP interaction on the OOP capacity nor for the effect of structural non-linearity on the OOP force demand. The second approach is based on nonlinear static analysis and on the application of refined literature formulations accounting for the IP/OOP interaction and for structural non-linearity for the definition of the OOP capacity and force demand. The PGAs at the OOP collapse of infills obtained by applying both approaches are compared to show their significant overestimation if the IP/OOP interaction and structural non-linearity are not considered, i.e., if current code provisions are applied. Considerations concerning the influence of the number of storeys and of the design PGA of buildings on the PGA at the OOP collapse of infills are reported. Frequency distributions of OOP collapses at different storeys and fragility curves relating the probability of OOP collapse to both the PGA acting in the OOP direction and the maximum IDR attained in the IP direction are shown. For all case-study buildings, a range of 42 infill layouts, different for thickness and masonry compressive strength, is considered and, with the application of the more refined, not code-based approach, a limit state curve defining the infill height-to-thickness ratio/masonry compressive strength couples for which the OOP safety check of infills can be neglected is reported.",Out-of-plane seismic safety assessment of URM infills accounting for the in-plane/out-of-plane interaction in a nonlinear static framework,2019,URM infill wall; Out-of-plane; In-plane/out-of-plane interaction; Nonlinear static analysis; Out-of-plane safety check,CAPACITY,0,0
13174,"Different available analytical and experimental metho-dologies of local and global damage index (LDI and GDI) determination for bridges and buildings along with their mathematical expression are reviewed in this article. In the literature, impact of seismic loading and material deterioration due to ageing effects is the main focus to study the performance. Case studies for assessment of bridges and buildings are appended here to understand variation of damage index (DI) for various levels of seismicity. The utility of the proposed methods has been discussed in this case study. This article also includes progressive development, limita-tions and directions of future research on damage assessment of structures. Based on the extensive liter-ature review, the authors have critically analysed the pros and cons of the available methods.

In future, damage-based design considering multiple response parameters along with uncertain load characteristics such as seismic load, wind load, blast load, floods and accidental load could be considered to select allowable damage of structures that would help to understand and ensure the time-dependent safety, progressive phases of collapse and serviceability with high reliability satisfying smart structural requirements. © 2019 Current Science Association, Bengaluru.",Overview of damage assessment of structures,2019,Bridges and buildings; Damage index; Loss assessment; Seismicity,None,0,0
13175,"Common engineering practice in multi-hazard design is to consider each natural hazard independently. The underlying assumption is that it is highly unlikely that one disaster will be closely followed by another. This approach dominated large part of the 20th century. The engineering community has made large strides in designing structures to withstand known hazards, leading to improved reliability and safety of infrastructure. This in turn has supported population growth and increased prosperity. As witness to our success, it is common in developed nations to consider it unacceptable for a disaster to cause large scale devastation. However, the nature of the disasters has proved otherwise. It is unlikely that one extreme event will have catastrophic consequences on communities, because we know how to prepare for a single event. Instead, as experience shows, disasters are more typically comprised by one event followed by one or more other events, exposing the vulnerability of our design assumptions. The examples of multiple disasters are Indonesia (i.e., earthquake followed by tsunami followed by volcano), Haiti (i.e., earthquake followed by cholera outbreak) and Japan (i.e., earthquake followed by tsunami followed by nuclear meltdown). The obvious solution is to focus on understanding on the resilience of the system as an its ability to rapidly recover from the event. This paper proposes a framework for quantitative measure and mathematically reproducible definitions of structural resilience as it pertains to a building's ability to minimize the potential for undesirable consequences. The resilience assessment and design process follow logical progression of steps, starting with the characterization of hazards, continuing through analysis simulations, damage modelling, and loss assessment by finding and subsequently balancing functional relationships between design and analysis and consequences. The outcomes of each process are articulated through a series of generalized variables, termed as topology, geometry, damage and hazard intensity measures. Topological analysis methods are developed to map the effects of blast and extreme fire exposure so that the corresponding intensity measures can be addressed simultaneously during design. © 20th Congress of IABSE, New York City 2019: The Evolving Metropolis - Report.

13176,"This chapter includes papers that deal with the seismic evaluation and rehabilitation of existing buildings in Romania and neighbouring countries- e.g. Republic of Moldova, using both fundamental and cutting-edge approaches. The seismic assessment and rehabilitation of existing constructions after the 10th of November 1940 and 4th of March 1977 earthquakes in Romania are investigated in a very practical approach, presenting the main concepts, the analysis methods and the strengthening methods used for existing structures. Two examples of such structures, one from Bucharest, the other from Focsani, are thus discussed in the paper entitled Seismic Assessment and Rehabilitation of Existing Constructions After the 10th November 1940 and 4th March 1977 Earthquakes in Romania. The authors conclude that the original method, based on energy concepts to judge the failure criteria for resistance and deformation, by comparing the surface of member's capacity, for a single degree of freedom model of various multi-story constructions, to the surface required by the building response to different types of earthquakes, is still valid today. The failure theories, based on the energetic model from strut-tie models, or taking into consideration the areas in which the theories based on the continuous, homogenous and isotropic body hypothesis cannot be applied, for which specific finite element models apply for the potential cracking areas or probabilistic models with the aid of fragility curves, are all analysis methods of medium or greater complexity which are necessary to be applied for the structures or areas of structures of important constructions and which will be developed more in the future.",Overview of Part IV: Seismic Evaluation and Rehabilitation.

13177,"In macro-scale roadway networks, bridges are the main point-site components and tend to be among the most vulnerable elements in case an earthquake occurs. Given this weakness, the proper assessment of the seismic vulnerability is of high importance to obtain reliable estimates of losses in the immediate aftermath of seismic events or to manage emergency situations. In this sense, the use of real data (e.g. geometrical and material parameters drawn from national bridge inventory databases), accounting for its variability, is preferable and increases the accuracy of estimated fragility or vulnerability functions of the bridge portfolio of a certain region. However, complete information for each single bridge is typically not available. One way to address this limitation is to use statistical tools to handle large-scale loss estimation studies and to gauge the parametric characterization of relevant structural behaviour properties. In view of these considerations, the present paper addresses the first step towards the development of supporting tools for improved large-scale seismic assessment of bridges by characterizing the geometrical and material properties of typical Italian reinforced concrete (RC) bridges. With this characterization, we generate a large bridge stock for a specific bridge typology using the Latin Hypercube sampling scheme. Such bridge stock is then assessed with a view to establish simplified relationships between the fundamental period of vibration and the geometrical configuration of the bridge. The developed formulae, defined as a function of two geometrical variables, can be used to quickly estimate the period of vibration and the seismic demand (and fragility) of the structure in expedite large-scale seismic assessment studies.

The time history of the measurement is divided into a series of time intervals, and then the model of equivalent linear system is employed to identify the modal parameters of the system for each time interval. The differential equation can be transformed into the frequency domain by finite Fourier transform and the response in the frequency domain can be solved by algebraic equations instead of differentials equations for each time interval. In this paper, this new identification strategy is applied to the identification of two real buildings to monitor the change of modal parameters. The parameters of these structures are identified using the response records of the structure under the attack of earthquakes of different intensities. By employing the Maximum Softening Index and Approximate Story Damage Index, we can determine the damage states of these buildings. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",Parametric identification and damage assessment of real buildings,2019,None,Differential equations; Frequency domain analysis; Genetic algorithms; Life cycle; Linear systems; Modal analysis; Parameter estimation; Algebraic equations; Damage assessments; Equivalent linear systems; Finite Fourier transform; Frequency domains; Hybrid genetic algorithms; Identification strategies; Parametric identification; Damage detection,0,0
13179,"The selection of an efficient mitigation technique from a number of alternatives to reduce the seismic risk of pre-seismic code school buildings is the main focus of this study. An on-ground survey of the school building stock in a large study area that extends for 6000 km2 enabled the selection of four different benchmark structures. Detailed simulation models are developed for the selected benchmark buildings and 14 retrofit alternatives to define their performance criteria and assess their seismic vulnerability. The earthquake hazard of the study region is accounted for using a wide range of ground motions, representing two seismic scenarios pertinent to several medium seismicity regions. The relative seismic performance of pre-code buildings and different mitigation alternatives from a large number of dynamic response simulations up to collapse is described in terms of fragility curves as well as a proposed measure of response termed the overall performance factor. This measure of response along with the systematic seismic assessment approach adopted in this study enable prioritizing different retrofit alternatives based on their performance-to-cost ratios, which help to arrive at an efficient and cost-effective mitigation strategy for the implementation at the regional scale. © The Author(s) 2016.",Performance assessment and prioritization of mitigation approaches for pre-seismic code structures,2017,Dynamic response simulations; Mitigation measures; Pre-code reinforced concrete buildings; Seismic performance; Vulnerability assessment,Benchmarking; Concrete buildings; Cost effectiveness; Dynamic response; Reinforced concrete; Retrofitting; School buildings; Seismic waves; Dynamic response simulation; Mitigation measures; Mitigation techniques; Overall performance factors; Performance assessment; Seismic Performance; Seismic vulnerability; Vulnerability assessments; Earthquakes,0,0
13180,"The wind, storm surge, and flooding loads due to the 2017 Hurricane Harvey had a detrimental impact on the built infrastructure in coastal communities. This paper presents the lessons learned from damage to the built infrastructure in the Port Aransas region in Texas observed after Hurricane Harvey through reconnaissance and postsurvey data as well as statistical analyses and associated patterns of failure modes. The observations and findings of this study are also compared to empirical evidence from past hurricane-induced damage to buildings. A set of rapid and detailed damage assessment data is developed to focus on damage failure modes, distribution of damage to structural and nonstructural components, as well as repair, occupancy, and functionality status at the time of the inspection. The most common damage modes were identified as damage to roof components (roof shingles), vinyl siding, and interior nonstructural elements. It was also observed that the location of the building in the city and surrounding topography as well as structural age of the infrastructure were important parameters that influenced the response of buildings to hurricane-induced loads. The evidence from the performance of the inspected buildings shows the need for new design alternatives as well as sustainable retrofits for existing buildings such as incorporating heavier nailing schedules for roof sheathing and shingles as well as strengthening the connection of vinyl siding.

Considering the impact of the uncertainties in seismic loading and response of structures, the adopted fragility methodology is believed to provide a realistic and robust assessment of seismic performance and vulnerability of the structures. Fragility curves were developed by considering appropriate performance levels and using the response data from nonlinear time-history analyses of the structures in longitudinal and transverse directions with respective moment and shear connections. Results of the fragility analysis showed that inclusion of panel zone reinforcement in numerical simulation of the framed structures lowers the seismic vulnerability and probability of damage to the structures. The relatively lower seismic performances of the structures in the transverse direction with shear connections and lower lateral stiffness were demonstrated as well. Moreover, the eight-story structure was found to be more vulnerable to seismic loading and severe damages compared to the three-story structure. The adopted fragility method can serve as an effective tool for assessing the performance and safety levels of structures, and in decision making as well as financing for seismic protection.

13182,"Brittle shear failure of partial Reinforced Concrete (RC) wall pier system is usually observed in post-earthquake investigations, which affects the building functions seriously. A new RC wall pier system with unbonded steel rod dampers is introduced in this study. Numerical simulation using solid element method, validated by existing experimental results, was adopted firstly to investigate the behaviors of dampers, lateral force capacity, stiffness degradation, and ductility of the frame with the new RC wall pier system considering the influence of the dampers and the frame axial compression ratios. To decrease the huge computational costs of the solid element model, macro element model was further developed and verified. Performance evaluation of a twelve-story RC frame structure with three models of RC wall piers, namely damper model, slit model and rigid model, was conducted with the macro element model. Results show that RC frame with RC wall piers equipped with dampers possesses a stable lateral, and the designed dampers provide more than 20% of the lateral force to the frame. It is advised that the axial compression ratio of frame column shall be within 0.1 from the perspectives of plastic regions of dampers and lateral force capacity of frame. The nonlinear responses of the new RC wall pier system can be well captured by the macro element model with less computational costs. By comprehensively considering the structural drift ratios, the energy dissipation and the shear force in the frame beam, the damper model is suggested to be the best among the three models.

13183,"In this paper the study of FEMA-P695 on collapse performance of moment frames is extended to take soil-structure interaction into account. Special reinforced concrete moment frames being 4, 8, 12, and 16 stories tall resting on firm, medium, and soft soils are considered. The incremental dynamic analysis is performed under several strong ground motions to determine the fragility curves of the same structures both on rigid and flexible bases. Modeling of the flexible base is performed using the beam-on-nonlinear-foundation method in which the underlying soil is replaced with materially nonlinear no-tension springs. The comparative study reveals that for keeping the collapse probability lower than a certain value, the maximum acceptable design spectral acceleration including soil-structure interaction has to be considerably smaller than that on a fixed base. The reason is shown to be happening because of larger drifts in the lower stories of a building when its base is flexible. Moreover, modified fragility curves are developed for fixed-base structures in which effects of soil-structure interaction are included.

13184,"Disaster resilience of a building consists of its capacity to restore almost its full functionality in the aftermath of a natural hazard. Controlling the building’s resilience is important for developing the hazard mitigation strategy. The main focus of this study is to present a framework for resilience-based design of steel buildings subjected to seismic ground motions that can be extended to investigate the building performance to other natural hazards. A walk-through of the methodology is presented in a case study comprising a 3-storey moderately ductile concentrically braced frame office building located inVancouver, B.C., Canada. The building was designed according to the current Canadian building code and Steel design standard. Herein, damage levels were defined as function of performance levels associated to earthquake intensity, fragility curves were derived from incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) curves obtained from time-history analyses using the OpenSees software and both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties were considered. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",Performance metrics for seismic-resilient steel braced frame buildings,2019,None,Earthquakes; Hazards; Life cycle; Microalloyed steel; Office buildings; Seismic design; Structural frames; Uncertainty analysis; Building performance; Concentrically braced frames; Disaster resiliences; Earthquake intensity; Epistemic uncertainties; Incremental dynamic analysis; Seismic ground motions; Time history analysis; Architectural design,0,0
13185,"Hurricane Maria has been termed the worst natural disaster on record in Puerto Rico, as the third consecutive major hurricane to threaten the Leeward Islands in a two-week period. The storm caused catastrophic damage and numerous fatalities across the northeastern Caribbean, creating hurricane force winds on St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, less than two weeks after Hurricane Irma caused extensive damage in St. John and St. Thomas. Maria made its U.S. landfall on September 20 near Yabucoa, Puerto Rico, as a strong Category 4 hurricane. As part of a wider coordinated effort for the 2017 season, a regional node was established in Puerto Rico to organize local reconnaissance efforts between October 6 and November 18, 2017. A separate reconnaissance campaign was organized for the U.S. Virgin Islands, November 9-14, 2017, to document the impacts of Irma and Maria. Investigations on all four islands employed primarily door-to-door building damage assessments using a customized Fulcrum smartphone application. At select locations, additional unmanned aerial surveys were conducted. This paper will introduce the overall reconnaissance effort, followed by case studies highlighting common failure modes with a particular emphasis on topographic effects.",Performance of Structures under Successive Hurricanes: Observations from Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands after Hurricane Maria,2018,None,None,0,0
13186,"Civil structures should be designed with the lowest cost and longest lifetime possible and without service failure. The efficient and sustainable use of materials in building design and construction has always been at the forefront for civil engineers and environmentalists. Timber is one of the best contenders for these purposes particularly in terms of aesthetics; fire protection; strength-to-weight ratio; acoustic properties and seismic resistance. In recent years, timber has been used in commercial and taller buildings due to these significant advantages. It should be noted that, since the launch of the modern building standards and codes, a number of different structural systems have been developed to stabilise steel or concrete multistorey buildings, however, structural analysis of high-rise and multi-storey timber frame buildings subjected to lateral loads has not yet been fully understood. Additionally, timber degradation can occur as a result of biological decay of the elements and overloading that can result in structural damage. In such structures, the deficient members and joints require strengthening in order to satisfy new code requirements; determine acceptable level of safety; and avoid brittle failure following earthquake actions. This paper investigates performance assessment and damage assessment of older multi-storey timber buildings. One approach is to retrofit the beams in order to increase the ductility of the frame. Experimental studies indicate that Sprayed Fibre Reinforced Polymer (SFRP) repairing/retrofitting not only updates the integrity of the joint, but also increases its strength; stiffness; and ductility in such a way that the joint remains elastic. Non-linear finite element analysis ('pushover') is carried out to study the behaviour of the structure subjected to simulated gravity and lateral loads. A new global index is re-assessed for damage assessment of the plain and SFRP-retrofitted frames using capacity curves obtained from pushover analysis. This study shows that the proposed method is suitable for structural damage assessment of aged timber buildings. Also SFRP retrofitting can potentially improve the performance and load carrying capacity of the structure. © 2014 Techno-Press, Ltd.",Performance-based and damage assessment of SFRP retrofitted multi-storey timber buildings,2015,Damage detection; Performance-based assessment; Pushover analysis and Sprayed Fibre Reinforced Polymer (SFRP); Timber buildings,None,0,0
13187,"In recent years, severe hurricanes have caused enormous economic losses for society and placed tremendous burden on the insurance industry. As the number of residential buildings in hurricane prone regions continues to rise, hurricane hazard mitigation is of paramount importance for residential buildings. Although different retrofit measures are available to mitigate hurricane damage and to reduce the associated social and economic losses, choosing the most cost-effective ones is still an engineering challenge. This paper uses the performance-based hurricane engineering (PBHE) framework with multilayer Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) for the loss analysis of residential buildings subject to hurricane hazard. A highly efficient modified version of the multilayer MCS technique based on copula is proposed for the faster re-evaluation of hurricane risk when different hurricane hazard mitigation strategies are considered for the same building. This technique is combined with cost-benefit analysis to provide effective decision making tools based on the performance comparison of different design and retrofit solutions. A realistic case study is presented to illustrate the proposed methodology by comparing the cost-effectiveness of several commonly used hurricane hazard mitigation techniques and design alternatives for a typical residential building.

13188,"Tsunamis are low-probability high-consequence events, usually caused by an earthquake in the ocean and can result in high casualty rates and billions of dollars in damage. Tsunamis can be divided into two main categories: near-field and far-field tsunamis, based on the location of their origin with respect to the site of interest. To perform risk assessment of communities subjected to tsunamis, the current approach would be to use empirical data from historical events, making the data site specific. Recently, researchers have developed approaches to estimate the risk of structures subjected to far-field earthquake generated tsunamis using a simulated tsunami force on a structure numerically. However, for near-field tsunamis, ground motions caused by the earthquake will reach the structure earlier than the tsunami, damaging the structure, which can substantially impair its structural performance in the following tsunami. The multi-hazard case of tsunami following earthquake is discussed herein and a physics-based approach to estimate the risk of structures subjected to them is presented. An illustrative example is presented to elaborate the methodology for a steel building. Successive nonlinear analyses are used to develop fragility functions based on joint earthquake-tsunami intensity measures (spectral acceleration-flow depth-flow velocity). These functions are used in combination with hazard analysis of a specific location to obtain loss estimates. Three different approaches were used for this process and the results showed that the use of the joint three intensity-measure fragilities is essential for the accuracy when estimating damage or structural loss and neglecting their interaction results in substantial errors.",Performance-Based Tsunami Engineering for Risk Assessment of Structures Subjected to Multi-Hazards: Tsunami following Earthquake,2021,Multi-Hazard; Tsunami; Earthquake; Performance-Based Engineering; Loss Analysis; Monte Carlo Simulation; Risk Assessment,FRAGILITY CURVES; SENSITIVITY,0,0
13189,"Tsunamis are rare destructive phenomena caused by the sudden displacement of a large amount of water in the ocean and can result in enormous losses to coastal communities. The resilience of coastal communities to tsunamis can be improved through the use of risk-informed decision making tools. Performance Based Engineering (PBE) approaches have been developed for different natural hazards including earthquake, fire, hurricane, and wind to perform probabilistic risk assessment for structures. In this study, a probabilistic Performance-Based Tsunami Engineering (PBTE) framework based on the total probability theorem is proposed for the risk assessment of structures subject to tsunamis. The proposed framework can be disaggregated into the different basic analysis phases of hazard analysis, foundation and structure characterization, interaction analysis, structural analysis, damage analysis, and loss analysis. An application example consisting of the risk assessment of a three-story steel moment frame structure was performed using the proposed framework. The probability of exceedance of the total replacement cost including structural, nonstructural, and content losses were computed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

13190,"One of the next frontiers in structural wind engineering is the design of tall buildings using performance-based approaches. Currently, tall buildings are being designed using provisions in the building codes and standards to meet an acceptable level of public safety and serviceability. However, recent studies in wind and earthquake engineering have highlighted the conceptual and practical limitations of the code-oriented design methods. Performance-based wind design (PBWD) is the logical extension of the current wind design approaches to overcome these limitations. Towards the development of PBWD, in this paper, we systematically review the advances made in this field, highlight the research gaps, and provide a basis for future research. Initially, the anatomy of the Wind Loading Chain is presented, in which emphasis was given to the early works of Alan G. Davenport. Next, the current state of practice to design tall buildings for wind load is presented, and its limitations are highlighted. Following this, we critically review the state of development of PBWD. Our review on PBWD covers the existing design frameworks and studies conducted on the nonlinear response of structures under wind loads. Thereafter, to provide a basis for future research, the nonlinear response of simple yielding systems under long-duration turbulent wind loads is studied in two phases. The first phase investigates the issue of damage accumulation in conventional structural systems characterized by elastic-plastic, bilinear, pinching, degrading, and deteriorating hysteretic models. The second phase introduces methods to develop new performance objectives for PBWD based on joint peak and residual deformation demands. In this context, the utility of multi-variate demand modeling using copulas and kernel density estimation techniques is presented. This paper also presents joined fragility curves based on the results of incremental dynamic analysis. Subsequently, the efficiency of tuned mass dampers and self-centering systems in controlling the accumulation of damage in wind-excited structural systems are investigated. The role and the need for explicit modeling of uncertainties in PBWD are also discussed with a case study example. Lastly, two unified PBWD frameworks are proposed by adapting and revisiting the Wind Loading Chain. This paper concludes with a summary and a proposal for future research.","Performance-based wind design of tall buildings: concepts, frameworks, and opportunities",2020,performance-based wind design; wind loading chain; damage accumulation; joined fragility curves; copulas; kernel density estimation; incremental dynamic analysis; tuned mass dampers; self-centering systems,LIFE-CYCLE COST; INCLUDING RESIDUAL DEFORMATIONS; MAXIMUM SEISMIC DISPLACEMENTS; REINFORCED-CONCRETE FRAME; SELF-CENTERING SYSTEMS; SHAPE-MEMORY ALLOYS; TUNED MASS DAMPERS; INDUCED MOTION; LOAD FACTORS; EFFICIENT FRAMEWORK,0,0
13191,"Performance-based wind engineering (PBWE) is undergoing a period of rapid development with numerous procedures and frameworks being proposed over the past few years. Notwithstanding these advancements, there is still a knowledge gap concerning the relative severity, dependency and rate of occurrence of structural and envelope damage in extreme wind events. This work is focused on investigating this problem for engineered buildings. In particular, envelope damage is estimated through a recently introduced PBWE framework that explicitly includes the effects of demands originating from dynamic net pressure and the structural responses. Structural damage is estimated through both fragility analysis as well as material yielding/hysteresis modeled through the adoption of a nonlinear fiber-based finite element formulation. Structural responses include the effects of large deformations through solving the finite element model in a corotational environment. To investigate the relative severity and dependency between the damages, a carefully calibrated archetype 45-story steel building located in Miami, FL, and subject to hurricane winds is studied. Probabilistic damage metrics are estimated for both the envelope and structural systems and are subsequently discussed in terms of relative severity, occurrence rates and nonlinear structural behavior. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Performance-based wind-induced structural and envelope damage assessment of engineered buildings through nonlinear dynamic analysis,2021,Building envelope; Nonlinear dynamic analysis; Nonlinear structural response; Performance-based wind engineering; Probabilistic performance assessment,Finite element method; Structural analysis; Damage assessments; Finite element formulations; Fragility analysis; Nonlinear structural behavior; Probabilistic damage; Structural damages; Structural response; Structural systems; Damage detection,0,0
13192,"Ancient monumental masonry buildings are complex structures that were not based on an engineered design, underwent many transformations during their life and often present lack of connections among the structural elements. Earthquakes are the main cause of damage for ancient masonry structures and, in order to reduce their vulnerability with compatible and light interventions, it is necessary to have accurate models for the seismic analysis, able to simulate the nonlinear behavior of masonry, and a well defined performance-based assessment procedure, aimed to guarantee the acceptable level of risk for the occupants and for the conservation of the monument itself. The paper outlines the guidelines that were developed within the PERPETUATE European research project. The wide variety of architectural assets is classified and the related proper modeling strategies are identified; moreover, immovable artistic assets are considered in the assessment. A displacement-based approach is adopted, because these structures crack even for low intensity earthquakes and can survive severe ones only if they have a sufficient displacement capacity. Safety and conservation requirements are proposed by considering distinct sets of performance levels, related to use and safety of people, conservation of the building and of the artistic assets that might be present. Some indications on the seismic hazard assessment are provided, considering the distinctive features of some types of ancient structures. Within the fundamental knowledge phase, sensitivity analysis is proposed in order to address and optimize the in-situ investigation and to define proper confidence factors, aimed to consider epistemic and statistical uncertainties. Different modeling approaches and methods of analysis are considered, depending on the characteristics of the structure; both static pushover and incremental dynamic nonlinear analyses are considered. Related verification procedures are defined to evaluate the seismic intensity measure, and the corresponding return period, which is compatible with each performance level that must be fulfilled.",PERPETUATE guidelines for seismic performance-based assessment of cultural heritage masonry structures,2015,Displacement-based assessment; Masonry; Cultural heritage; Artistic assets; Performance levels,MODAL PUSHOVER ANALYSIS; VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; SPECTRA; PROBABILITY; DESIGN,0,0
13193,"Before commencement of any planning and management activities, to mitigate the disastrous consequences of man-made and natural disasters, it is necessary to analyze the potential hazard underlying in the area and work out consequences of disasters. Disasters can result in failed development, but failures in development planning can also lead to disaster risk, which is the case in most of the cities which are disaster prone in developing countries. The researcher has tried to respond to the unique challenge presented by the Indian cities which are earthquake and flood prone, by developing earthquake and flood damage scenario by utilizing—appropriate damage assessment criteria after studying the literature survey, building and infrastructure inventories, topographical information, demographical data and other relevant facts and figures to propose an urban planning model to minimize the damages. The developed planning model has to be inserted into master plan for future development of the area. The master plan should be integrated with the Disaster Management Plan. In the present study, the organizational structure existing in the Hoshangabad district for Disaster Management is studied along with the incident command system (ICS) a standardized method of managing disasters. In view of the multifarious and multi jurisdictional functions involved, the ICS with appropriate modifications can be adopted here as a management tool hence District Headquarters Team for Hoshangabad has been proposed.

13194,"We present an unsupervised deep learning approach for post-disaster building damage detection that can transfer to different typologies of damage or geographical locations. Previous advances in this direction were limited by insufficient qualitative training data. We propose to use a state-of-the-art Anomaly Detecting Generative Adversarial Network (ADGAN) because it only requires pre-event imagery of buildings in their undamaged state. This approach aids the post-disaster response phase because the model can be developed in the pre-event phase and rapidly deployed in the post-event phase. We used the xBD dataset, containing pre-and post-event satellite imagery of several disaster-types, and a custom made Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) dataset, containing post-earthquake imagery. Results showed that models trained on UAV-imagery were capable of detecting earthquake-induced damage. The best performing model for European locations obtained a recall, precision and F1-score of 0.59, 0.97 and 0.74, respectively. Models trained on satellite imagery were capable of detecting damage on the condition that the training dataset was void of vegetation and shadows. In this manner, the best performing model for (wild)fire events yielded a recall, precision and F1-score of 0.78, 0.99 and 0.87, respectively. Compared to other supervised and/or multi-epoch approaches, our results are encouraging. Moreover, in addition to image classifications, we show how contextual information can be used to create detailed damage maps without the need of a dedicated multi-task deep learning framework. Finally, we formulate practical guidelines to apply this single-epoch and unsupervised method to real-world applications. © 2020 by the authors.

13195,"In the wake of recent strong earthquakes in Croatia, there is a need for a detailed and more comprehensive post-earthquake damage assessment. Given that masonry structures are highly vulnerable to horizontal actions caused by earthquakes and a majority of the Croatian building stock is made of masonry, this field is particularly important for Croatia. In this paper, a complete assessment of an educational building in Zagreb Lower Town is reported. An extensive program of visual inspection and geometrical surveys has been planned and performed. Additionally, an in situ shear strength test is presented. After extensive fieldwork, collected data and results were input in 3Muri software for structural modeling.

13196,"Structural damage assessment following an extreme event can provide valuable information and insight into unanticipated damage and failure modes to improve design philosophies and design codes as well as reduce vulnerability. Oftentimes, structural engineers create finite element models (FEM) of the structure in which numerous model parameters require calibration to simulate the current state. This information may include structural plan details (geometry), material characteristics (strength and stiffness parameters), as well as observed damage patterns (cracks, spalling, etc.). Ground-based lidar (GBL) scans and Structure-from-Motion (SfM) can rapidly capture dimensionally accurate point clouds of the structure or facility of interest. Furthermore, point clouds can used to efficiently document perishable structural damage data digitally prior recovery or retrofit efforts. Within these point clouds, information can be extracted to objectively locate damage patterns in non-temporal datasets. Localization and quantification of damage can serve to update models with high fidelity within forensic investigations as well as to estimate the remaining structural capacity. In this work, an algorithm based on two spatially invariant geometrical features was used to identify and quantify structural damage from point cloud data for two case study buildings. The first case-study building is an 18-story high-rise condominium building that was significantly damaged during the 2015 Gorkha (Nepal) Earthquake. The damage included significant cracks in partition walls, unreinforced masonry infill walls, and section-loss within coupling beams and staircases at various levels. The second case-study structure, from the same earthquake event, is a five-tiered pagoda style temple built using timber beams and thick brick masonry walls. The temple sustained moderate damage where shear cracks developed at lower levels and seam of the wall piers. Through the developed damage detection method, cracking, concrete spalling, and loss of cross section within the point cloud data of the nonstructural and structural elements are quantified. © 11th National Conference on Earthquake Engineering 2018, NCEE 2018: Integrating Science, Engineering, and Policy.

13198,"Urban infrastructures have become imperative to human life. Any damage to these infrastructures as a result of detrimental activities would accrue huge economical costs and severe casualties. War in particular is a major anthropogenic calamity with immense collateral effects on the social and economic fabric of human nations. Therefore, damaged buildings assessment plays a prominent role in post-war resettlement and reconstruction of urban infrastructures. The data-analysis process of this assessment is essential to any post-disaster program and can be carried out via different formats. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and Interferometric SAR (InSAR) techniques help us to establish a reliable and fast monitoring system for detecting post-war damages in urban areas. Along this thread, the present study aims to investigate the feasibility and mode of implementation of Sentinel-1 SAR data and InSAR techniques to estimate post-war damage in war-affected areas as opposed to using commercial high-resolution optical images. The study is presented in the form of a survey to identify urban areas damaged or destroyed by war (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, ISIL, or ISIS occupation) in the city of Mosul, Iraq, using Sentinel-1 (S1) data over the 2014-2017 period. Small BAseline Subset (SBAS), Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) and coherent-intensity-based analysis were also used to identify war-damaged buildings. Accuracy assessments for the proposed SAR-based mapping approach were conducted by comparing the destruction map to the available post-war destruction map of United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR); previously developed using optical very high-resolution images, drone imagery, and field visits. As the findings suggest, 40% of the entire city, the western sectors, especially the Old City, were affected most by ISIS war. The findings are also indicative of the efficiency of incorporating Sentinel-1 SAR data and InSAR technique to map post-war urban damages in Mosul. The proposed method could be widely used as a tool in damage assessment procedures in any post-war reconstruction programs. © 2021 by the authors.

13199,"Quick post-disaster actions demand automated, rapid and detailed building damage assessment. Among the available technologies, post-event oblique airborne images have already shown their potential for this task. However, existing methods usually compensate the lack of pre-event information with aprioristic assumptions of building shapes and textures that can lead to uncertainties and misdetections. However, oblique images have been already captured over many cities of the world, and the exploitation of pre- and post-event data as inputs to damage assessment is readily feasible in urban areas. In this paper, we investigate the potential of multi-temporal oblique imagery for detailed damage assessment focusing on two methodologies: the first method aims at detecting severe structural damages related to geometrical deformation by combining the complementary information provided by photogrammetric point clouds and oblique images. The developed method detected 87% of damaged elements. The failed detections are due to varying noise levels within the point cloud which hindered the recognition of some structural elements. We observed, in general that the façade regions are very noisy in point clouds. To address this, we propose our second method which aims to detect damages to building façades using the oriented oblique images. The results show that the proposed methodology can effectively differentiate among the three proposed categories: collapsed/highly damaged, lower levels of damage and undamaged buildings, using a computationally light-weight approach. We describe the implementations of the above mentioned methods in detail and present the promising results achieved using multi-temporal oblique imagery over the city of L'Aquila (Italy).",POTENTIAL of MULTI-TEMPORAL OBLIQUE AIRBORNE IMAGERY for STRUCTURAL DAMAGE ASSESSMENT,2016,3D Point Cloud; Change detection; Classification; Oblique airborne images; Structural damage,None,0,0
13200,"The interest in probabilistic methodologies to demonstrate structural fire safety has increased significantly in recent times. However, the evaluation of the structural behavior under fire loading is computationally expensive even for simple structural models. In this regard, machine learning-based surrogate modeling provides an appealing way forward. Surrogate models trained to simulate the behavior of structural fire engineering (SFE) models predict the response at negligible computational expense, thereby allowing for rapid probabilistic analyses and design iterations. Herein, a framework is proposed for the probabilistic analysis of fire exposed structures leveraging surrogate modeling. As a proof-of-concept a simple (analytical) non-linear model for the capacity of a concrete slab and an advanced (numerical) model for the capacity of a concrete column are considered. First, the procedure for training surrogate models is elaborated. Subsequently, the surrogate models are developed, followed by a probabilistic analysis to evaluate the probability density functions for the capacity. The results show that fragility curves developed based on the surrogate model agree with those obtained through direct sampling of the computationally expensive model, with the 10(-2) capacity quantile predicted with an error of less than 5%.

Furthermore, the probability of each class occurring at individual properties can be calculated, rather than adopting rigid classification boundaries as in Binnie & Partners.

13203,"Protecting cultural heritage from soil interaction related threats is a current and social issue to which scientific research must offer a contribution, considering also the fragility of the exposed territory. Among the related problems, the aim of this research is to develop fragility curves for churches located in landslide areas, in order to establish a reliable forecasting method applicable to intervention management. The choice of selecting churches as exposed structures makes the theme more challenging for their structural and geometric complexities. To generate the curves, exposed elements and damage severity levels have to be identified, through the definition of an intensity parameter of the landslide effects. The intensity parameter is represented by the global slope safety factor, in order to provide a simple tool to use in engineering practice. Vertical and horizontal slope movements, obtained by numerical analyses, can be related to the relevant safety factors as well as to possible permitted damage levels.

13204,"The purpose of this paper is to quantify the extent of damage of rectangular reinforced concrete shear walls after an earthquake using surface crack patterns. One of the most important tasks after an earthquake is to assess the safety and classify the performance level of buildings. This assessment is usually performed by visual inspection that is prone to significant errors. In this research, an extensive database on the images of damaged rectangular reinforced concrete shear walls is collected from the literature. This database includes more than 200 images from experimental quasi-static cyclic tests. Using the concept of fractal geometry, several probabilistic models are developed by extracting and regenerating the surface crack patterns of the collected walls. These models can estimate the peak drift ratio that the structure has experienced. The peak drift ratio predicted by the proposed models of this paper can be used to calculate the probability of exceedance of different damage states using existing fragility models. Furthermore, new fragility models are directly developed using the images of the damaged walls of the collected database. The proposed fragility curves calculate the probability of exceedance of damage states using the crack pattern of the damaged shear walls and consequently provide an estimation of the loss, repair cost, and repair time of the walls. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Predictive equations for drift ratio and damage assessment of RC shear walls using surface crack patterns,2019,Damage assessment; Fragility curves; Image processing; Peak drift ratio; Reinforced concrete shear wall; Structural health monitoring; Surface crack pattern; Visual assessment,Database systems; Earthquakes; Fractals; Image processing; Reinforced concrete; Repair; Shear walls; Structural health monitoring; Surface defects; Damage assessments; Drift ratio; Fragility curves; Reinforced concrete shear walls; Surface cracks; Visual assessments; Damage detection; crack; drift (glacial deposit); dynamic response; earthquake damage; health monitoring; image processing; prediction; reinforced concrete; structural response; visual analysis; wall,0,0

The model, developed in the framing of other similar methods proposed in the past, needs a limited number of parameters and is based on information collected in the aftermath of the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake. First, a damage survey carried out on two historic centres hit by L'Aquila earthquake is presented and the most recurrent failure types are classified in terms of severity and extension, leading to damage probability matrices (DPMs). Second, the proposed predictive model is calibrated on the basis of simple observations on the buildings' structural features. Finally, the model is validated through the application to a third historic centre characterized by the same features of the first two case studies. This application proves the generality of the proposed procedure by accurately reproducing the damage that was actually reported after the 2009 earthquake.

The approach includes rapid evaluation of the resilience index using vulnerability curves as well as accurate evaluation of structural resilience through uploading the results of nonlinear dynamic analysis to the Ri software. The current version of the software can be applied by civil engineers, stakeholders, and decision-makers. Meanwhile, the on-going development of the software aims to expand its capabilities in the area of seismic risk assessment. Compared to other similar tools, Ri is able to demonstrate the performance of structures right after the occurrence of an earthquake until the considered control time. Having utilized a strong database of more than 300 existing fragility and vulnerability curves, Ri will clearly show the vulnerability of structures by which the functionality curve can be attained as well. © 2021, Iran University of Science and Technology.",Pre-Event Assessment of Seismic Resilience Index for Typical Iranian Buildings via a Web-Based Tool,2021,Fragility curves; Seismic resilience index; Vulnerability curves; Web-based software,Decision making; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Seismology; Websites; Catastrophic event; Critical structures; Incremental dynamic analysis; Iranian buildings; Rapid assessment; Seismic resilience; Seismic risk assessment; Web-based softwares; Risk assessment,0,0
13207,"On August 21st, 2017, an earthquake with duration magnitude M-d = 4.0 and epicentre in Casamicciola Terme hit Ischia island, in the South of Italy. This event caused two fatalities and dozens of injured people. Moreover, despite the low magnitude, the earthquake produced significant damages to masonry and reinforced concrete (RC) buildings, with some partial or complete collapse of structures, in a very limited area close to the epicentre, while even at small distance from the most damaged zone the earthquake was just felt by local people and tourists. In the days after the event, discussions concerning the destructive effects of such an earthquake arose in the scientific community-as also reported by local and national media. In this paper, the seismic history of Ischia island is recalled to show and explain the peculiarity of the August 21st earthquake, which is also described in terms of ground motion and response spectra characteristics. The results of the first surveys carried out in Casamicciola Terme are reported, together with appropriate pictures, to introduce and explain the observed damage state of masonry and RC buildings in the epicentral zone. Then, data from the 15th general census of the population and dwellings (ISTAT) is used to define vulnerability classes according to the classification of the European Macrosismic Scale (EMS-98) (Grunthal, 1998). Seismic damage scenarios are then evaluated combining macro-seismic intensity values obtained using an interpolation method starting from QUEST macro-seismic survey data (Azzaro et al., 2017) and fragility curves for A-to-D vulnerability classes and for five damage states, from DSO (no damage) to DS5 (collapse) trough a Monte Carlo simulation technique. The distributions of Usable, Temporarily or Partially Unusable, and Unusable buildings, which are obtained by using relationships between damage and usability judgments obtained through post-earth-quake damage data collected after past seismic events, result in very good accordance with those published in September 1st, 2017 by the Department of Civil Protection, regarding a dataset of about 600 buildings.",Preliminary prediction of damage to residential buildings following the 21st August 2017 Ischia earthquake,2018,2017 Ischia earthquake; Damage; Macrosesmic; Census data; Usability,None,0,0
13209,"Post-earthquake operations, such as search and rescue and damage assessment, require efficient and effective surveying technologies to rapidly capture the ""as-damaged"" state of buildings. Recent research has shown early feasibility of methods for compilation of as-damaged building information models (BIM) from as-damaged point cloud data and ""as-built"" models. Yet research efforts to develop and rigorously test appropriate methods are seriously hampered by the obvious scarcity of access for researchers to earthquake-damaged buildings for surveying specimens and hence the lack of terrestrial laser scanning data of post-earthquake buildings. Full-scale or reduced-scale physical models of building components can be built and damaged using a shaking table or other structural laboratory equipment, and these can be scanned, all at reasonable cost. However, equivalent full-scale building samples are unavailable. The solution is to synthesize accurate and representative data sets. A computational approach for compiling such data sets, including BIM modeling of damaged buildings and synthetic scan generation, is proposed. The approach was validated experimentally through compilation of two full-scale models of buildings damaged in earthquakes in Turkey. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Preparation of Synthetic As-Damaged Models for Post-Earthquake BIM Reconstruction Research,2016,Building information modeling; Damaged building; Earthquake damage; Experimental dataset; Laser scanning emulator; Synthetic point clouds,Buildings; Damage detection; Earthquakes; Geophysics; Information theory; Laboratories; Laser applications; Surface analysis; Surveying; Surveys; Building Information Model - BIM; Earthquake damages; Experimental dataset; Laser scanning; Point cloud; Architectural design,0,0
13210,"The collapse of structure under earthquake is the most important and direct cause of casualties. At present, structural collapse has become a hot research topic in the field of seismic engineering. With the rapid improvement of seismic theory level, the study of earthquake collapse has also developed rapidly. The present research status of structural collapse damage under rare earthquake was summarized, and the systematicness and uncertainty of structural collapse damage were emphatically analyzed. The main criteria and analysis methods of collapse damage at home and abroad are discussed in detail, and their advantages, disadvantages and applicability are analyzed. The research results show that strong randomness is one of the main characteristics of collapse failure of structures. The establishment of overall failure criteria and damage assessment methods of structures needs to fully consider the characteristics of collapse failure of structures. Restricted by the test conditions, the existing test methods cannot fully and deeply reveal the mechanism of structural collapse, and the definition of critical state of building collapse is relatively vague. The developed analysis methods can complete the collapse analysis of a certain structure, but it cannot avoid the problems caused by unfavorable factors such as random effects. Whether the method is suitable for the large degree of non-linearity or the collapse stage still needs further study. The development of earthquake collapse is discussed in order to provide reference for future research. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Present Research Status of Earthquake Collapse Damage of RC Frame Structures,2020,Anti-collapse analysis method; Collapse damage; Collapse resistance test; Failure criterion; RC frame structural,Critical current density (superconductivity); Damage detection; Earthquake engineering; Earthquakes; Random processes; Rare earths; Structural analysis; Testing; Uncertainty analysis; Collapse analysis; Collapse damage; Collapse resistance; Failure criteria; RC frames; Failure (mechanical),0,0
13211,"This paper develops a model to forecast unreinforced masonry buildings' usability, i.e. the condition of a building being habitable or occupiable after a seismic event. The model is based on scores given to seven building parameters that are usually easy to survey: building position within the structural aggregate, number of storeys above ground, construction timespan, structural class, presence of strengthening interventions, roof type, and pre-existing damage to structural elements. Usability coefficients are calibrated for each, category of each parameter, by varying macroseismic intensity and regressing data from the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake in central Italy. The parameters contribute to the creation of a synthetic index, according to weights or loading computed through principal component analysis.

13214,"Asymmetry/irregularity is an undesired building characteristic that nevertheless exists commonly due to modern-day structural definitions. Asymmetry in plan, due to the uneven distribution of mass or stiffness can cause torsional coupling under seismic loads. A well-defined parameter that can sufficiently represent the damage of torsional buildings is non-existent, which may be why probabilistic seismic assessment methods such as fragility analyses have not been done for such buildings. The present study proposes 'Resultant Drift' as a parameter that can define the failure behaviour of asymmetric buildings and utilises the 2000 SAC FEMA method to analyse the seismic risk and develop fragility curves. The study observes the dependency of the extent of asymmetry and storey height on the failure probability. Investigations on the maximum storey rotation for the selected parameters show the necessity of international standard definitions in the performance levels of rotation behaviour. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Probabilistic Assessment of Torsional Buildings,2020,None,None,0,0
13215,"This paper presents probabilistic capacity models for composite floor systems subjected to column loss. The probabilistic capacity models are formulated by adding explanatory terms to an existing deterministic model. The explanatory terms are selected to correct the bias in deterministic capacity model. After that, virtual experiment data generated from finite element simulations are used to calibrate the model parameters. The finite element models consider the effect of axial loading on steel connection and the slab membrane action. The calibration of model parameters is conducted using the Bayesian inference approach. As an application and validation of the probabilistic capacity models, fragility analyses of typical composite floor systems are carried out. The developed fragility curves are compared with those from finite element analysis cooperated with Monte Carlo simulation. The comparison results show that the proposed capacity models are considered reasonable in predicting the resistance capacity of the composite floor and seek a compromise between model accuracy and computational efficiency.

13216,"Natural gas production in the Groningen field in the Netherlands is causing induced earthquakes that have raised concerns regarding the safety of the local population given that the exposed building stock (which is predominantly unreinforced masonry residential housing) has not been designed and constructed considering seismic loading. Significant effort has been invested to date in assessing the safety risk of these buildings within a probabilistic framework. This paper describes the efforts that have since been made to extend this framework for probabilistic damage assessment of the buildings, for slight non-structural, slight structural and moderate structural damage. Fragility functions for non-structural damage have been developed considering the observed damage from damage reports, rather than from damage claims due to a number of issues with the latter, as described herein. Structural damage has been estimated using analytical models that have been calibrated through extensive in situ data collection and experimental testing. The probabilistic damage assessment is presented in terms of F-N curves, which plot the annual frequency of exceedance against number of buildings reaching each damage state. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.",Probabilistic damage assessment of buildings due to induced seismicity,2019,Damage assessment; Fragility functions; Induced seismicity; Probabilistic risk; Unreinforced masonry,Earthquakes; Housing; Induced Seismicity; Masonry materials; Natural gas; Natural gas fields; Natural gas well production; Risk assessment; Safety engineering; Structural analysis; Damage assessments; Fragility function; Natural-gas production; Non-structural damage; Probabilistic damage; Probabilistic framework; Probabilistic risk; Unreinforced masonry; Damage detection; assessment method; damage mechanics; gas production; induced seismicity; masonry; probability; risk assessment; Groningen [Netherlands]; Netherlands,0,0
13217,"This paper presents a formulation for developing seismic demand models and estimating fragilities for reinforced concrete (RC) structures under mainshocks (MSs) only and mainshock-aftershock (MS-AS) sequences. The demand model for the MS only is a function of the MS intensity, while the model for the MS-AS sequence is a function of two variables, one describing the MS and one describing the AS. A Bayesian method is used to calibrate the demand models. The demand models are then used to estimate the fragility of RC structures. Predictive fragility curves are developed to include the uncertainties in the model parameters estimated by Bayesian approach, and confidence bounds of the fragility curves are developed to separate the effects of the uncertainty in the model parameters from the other sources of uncertainties. The proposed formulation is illustrated using a typical five-story RC frame building. The results show that the fragility curves for MS only tend to significantly underestimate the fragility curves for MS-AS sequences. Also, the uncertainty in the fragilities for the MS-AS sequence is, as expected, larger than that considering only the MS. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Probabilistic demand models and fragilities for reinforced concrete frame structures subject to mainshock-aftershock sequences,2021,Bayesian updating; Mainshock-aftershock impacts; Probabilistic modeling; Seismic damage evaluation; Structural reliability,Bayesian networks; Reinforced concrete; Uncertainty analysis; Aftershock sequence; Bayesian updating; Demand models; Fragility curves; Mainshock; Mainshock-aftershock impact; Probabilistic modeling; Seismic damage evaluation; Structural reliability; Uncertainty; Earthquakes; aftershock; Bayesian analysis; multistorey building; numerical model; probability; reinforced concrete; reliability analysis; seismic response; structural response,0,0
13219,"This research investigates the effects of structural pounding (collision of structures) caused by insufficient gaps between adjacent buildings when subjected to repeated earthquakes. The structural performance of adjacent buildings experiencing structural pounding under the effect of moderate repeated ground motions is analyzed using incremental dynamic analysis. Fragility curves for different performance levels are developed to represent the capacity of the adjacent buildings. Two four-story and two ten-story frames, regular and irregular, are combined to represent nine different cases of structural pounding and subsequently analyzed under three artificial seismic sequences. Three gap cases that measure 1 mm (contact structures), 10 cm, and 1 m are assigned to consider possible pounding combinations. Analysis results show that structural damage is directly proportional to ground motion intensity and structural irregularity and inversely proportional to gaps between structures. A minimum spacing of 1 m is proposed for buildings in areas that experience repeated earthquakes to avoid structural pounding. In regular frames, main damage is concentrated in the bottom story beams. Meanwhile, damage in irregular frames is concentrated in top and bottom story beams. Hence, additional stiffness that corresponds to the height of short buildings should be assigned to beams (immediate above and bottom). Meanwhile, the damage is concentrated in ground floor columns. Therefore, to avoid soft story failure mechanism, additional stiffness should be added to columns at bottom stories, especially on the ground floor. Based on the obtained results, modern seismic design codes need to be updated to address these findings on structural pounding to reduce damage in adjacent buildings during moderate to major seismic events. © 2018, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.",Probabilistic Evaluation of Structural Pounding Between Adjacent Buildings Subjected to Repeated Seismic Excitations,2019,IDA; ISDR; Nonlinear analysis; Regular and irregular building; Repeated earthquake; Seismic code; Structural pounding,None,0,0
13220,"Column removal failure is a common failure type of reinforced concrete (RC) structures subjected to progressive collapse. Thus, it is widely adopted to use the experimental/numerical column removal scenario to assess the progressive collapse capacity of RC structures. However, most of existing studies neglect the uncertainties involved in the structures, e.g., geometric size and material properties, while it may have great influence on the overall behavior of the structure under progressive collapse. In this paper, a probabilistic analysis of RC beam-column sub-assemblage under column removal scenario is performed. An efficient numerical model based on the finite element software OpenSEES is firstly developed for progressive collapse analysis of RC structures. The model adopts fiber beam-column element with co-rotational formulation to simulate the extreme behavior of frame members under column removal scenario, and uses a Min-Max material to apply the material failure criterion. Then the probability density evolution method (PDEM) is employed to conduct the probabilistic failure analysis. Two benchmark column removal tests of RC sub-assemblages are selected as the numerical case study examples. The deterministic analysis results indicates that the proposed finite element model is effective to reproduce the typical behavior of the sub-assemblages, while the probabilistic analysis provides mean values, standard variations and probability density functions (PDFs) of the whole progressive collapse process. Finally, the influence (or sensitivity) of the uncertain parameters on the global and local behaviors of RC beam-column sub-assemblage under column removal are quantified.",Probabilistic failure analysis of reinforced concrete beam-column sub-assemblage under column removal scenario,2019,Column removal failure; Progressive collapse; RC sub-assemblage; Probabilistic analysis; Probability density evolution method; Sensitivity analysis,PROGRESSIVE COLLAPSE RESISTANCE; SEISMIC RESPONSE ANALYSIS; DENSITY EVOLUTION METHOD; PLASTIC-DAMAGE MODEL; SLAB SUBSTRUCTURES; DYNAMIC-RESPONSE; ABNORMAL LOADS; SUBASSEMBLAGES; SIMULATION; BUILDINGS,0,0
13221,"Abnormal weather conditions due to climate change are currently increasing on both global and local scales. It is therefore important to ensure the safety of the areas where major national facilities are located by analyzing risk quantitatively and re-evaluating the existing major facilities, such as nuclear power plants, considering the load and capacity of extreme flood conditions. In this study, a risk analysis method is developed that combines flood hazard curves with fragility curves using hydraulic and hydrological models by GIS tools and the @RISK model for the probabilistic flood analysis of nuclear power plant sites. A two-dimensional (2D) analysis is first carried out to estimate flood depths in various watershed scenarios, and a representative hazard curve for both external and internal flooding is made by applying a verified probability distribution type for the flood watersheds. For the analysis of flooding within buildings, an internal grid is constructed using GIS with related design drawings, and based on the flood depth results of the 2D analysis, a hazard curve for the representative internal inundation using a verified probability distribution type is presented. In the present study, walkdowns with nuclear experts are conducted around the nuclear power plant area to evaluate the fragile structures and facilities under possible flooding. After reviewing the 2D inundation analysis results based on the selected major equipment and facilities, the zones requiring risk assessment are re-assigned. A fragility curve applying probability distribution for the site’s major equipment and facilities is also presented. Failure risk analysis of the major facilities is then conducted by combining the proposed hazard and fragility curves. Results in the form of quantitative values are obtained, and the indicators for risks as well as the reliability and optimal measures to support decision-making are also presented. Through this study, it is confirmed that risk assessment based on the proposed probabilistic flood analysis technique is possible for flood events occurring at nuclear power plant sites. © 2021 by the authors.

13222,"Flood loss modeling is a central component of flood risk analysis. Conventionally, this involves univariable and deterministic stage-damage functions. Recent advancements in the field promote the use of multivariable and probabilistic loss models, which consider variables beyond inundation depth and account for prediction uncertainty. Although companies contribute significantly to total loss figures, novel modeling approaches for companies are lacking. Scarce data and the heterogeneity among companies impede the development of company flood loss models. We present three multivariable flood loss models for companies from the manufacturing, commercial, financial, and service sector that intrinsically quantify prediction uncertainty. Based on object-level loss data (n = 1,306), we comparatively evaluate the predictive capacity of Bayesian networks, Bayesian regression, and random forest in relation to deterministic and probabilistic stage-damage functions, serving as benchmarks. The company loss data stem from four postevent surveys in Germany between 2002 and 2013 and include information on flood intensity, company characteristics, emergency response, private precaution, and resulting loss to building, equipment, and goods and stock. We find that the multivariable probabilistic models successfully identify and reproduce essential relationships of flood damage processes in the data. The assessment of model skill focuses on the precision of the probabilistic predictions and reveals that the candidate models outperform the stage-damage functions, while differences among the proposed models are negligible.

13223,"Developing earthquake scenarios for cities in areas with a moderate seismicity is a challenge due to the limited amount of available data, which is a source of large uncertainties. This concerns both the seismic hazard, for which only recordings for small earthquakes are available and the unknown earthquake resistance of the majority of structures not designed for seismic loading. The goal of the present study is to develop coherent probabilistic mechanics-based scenarios for a mid-size building stock including a comprehensive analysis of the uncertainties. As an application, a loss assessment for the school buildings of the city of Basel is performed for different scenarios of historical significance, such as the 1356 event, and from the deaggregation of the Swiss Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Model of 2015. The hazard part of the computations (i.e. ground motion estimation) is based on this model, a regional microzonation and recordings of small earthquakes on a dense strong motion network to compute site-amplification factors. The school buildings, which are mainly unreinforced masonry or reinforced concrete shear wall buildings, have been classified according to a specifically developed taxonomy. Fragility curves have been developed using non-linear static procedures and subsequently, vulnerability curves in terms of human and financial losses are proposed. The computations have been run with the OpenQuake engine, carefully propagating all the recognized uncertainties. Scenarios before and after retrofitting measures show their impact on the earthquake safety. A sensitivity analysis shows that the largest uncertainties come from the ground motion prediction although an improvement of all parts of the model is necessary to decrease the uncertainties. Although improved data and models are still necessary to be developed, probabilistic mechanics-based models outperform the capabilities of deterministic and/or empirical models for retrieving realistic earthquake loss distributions. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Probabilistic mechanics-based loss scenarios for school buildings in Basel (Switzerland),2017,Existing buildings; Loss assessment; Mechanical; Seismic hazard; Uncertainty; Vulnerability,Buildings; Earthquake effects; Earthquake engineering; Geophysics; Hazards; Losses; Mechanics; Motion estimation; Probability distributions; Reinforced concrete; School buildings; Seismic response; Seismology; Sensitivity analysis; Shear walls; Structural analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Comprehensive analysis; Ground motion prediction; Mechanical; Probabilistic mechanics; Reinforced concrete shear walls; Seismic hazards; Uncertainty; Vulnerability; Earthquakes; building; earthquake damage; earthquake engineering; earthquake event; geomechanics; ground motion; hazard assessment; probability; reinforced concrete; scenario analysis; seismic hazard; seismic response; seismicity; sensitivity analysis; uncertainty analysis; vulnerability; Basel; Basel-Stadt; Switzerland,0,0
13224,"Structural risk assessment against fire requires robust material models that take into account the uncertainty in material behavior over a range of elevated temperatures. Such probabilistic material models can directly inform performance-based design procedures for building fire safety. The objective of this research is to quantify uncertainties in retained strengths of steel and concrete when exposed to fire. First, hundreds of experimental data points covering a temperature range of 20°C-1,000°C are collected from literature. Then, different distribution candidates and modeling approaches are used with the collected data to identify probabilistic models for temperature dependents strength of steel and concrete. The proposed models are continuous probability distribution functions, with simple mathematical representations that are easy enough to arrange into systematic code for implementation in analytical and computational frameworks. Additionally, the proposed stochastic functions consider continuity in reliability appraisals during transition from room temperature to elevated temperatures. These models are applied to probabilistic evaluations of structural performance of three steel and two concrete columns, and the influence of the model choice is compared using fragility curves.

13225,"In recent decades, the seismic assessment of existing buildings has developed significantly from traditional objectives that focused on ensuring life safety of the building. The economic impact of the 1994 Northridge earthquake in the US due to the extensive damage suffered by buildings, in addition to the overall disruption, highlighted the need for a paradigm shift in the way in which the performance of buildings ought to be defined. This paper considers the assessment of existing Italian reinforced concrete (RC) frame buildings with masonry infill, which were typically gravity load designed (GLD) prior to the introduction of seismic design provisions in the 1970s. The assessment of GLD RC frames with masonry infill is discussed within a setting similar to that of the FEMA P58 guidelines that aim to provide practising engineers with the tools and procedures; both advanced and simplified, to quantify the performance of existing buildings in a more meaningful way that can be easily conveyed to decision makers. In this study, extensive numerical analysis was carried out on a variety of case study buildings to quantify and benchmark the performance; both in terms of expected demand and overall collapse capacity, where the impact of incorporating the potential shear failure in column members was shown to result in a reduction of up to 10% of the median collapse intensity due to the interaction with the masonry infill. Furthermore, loss estimation studies were carried out on these case study buildings to not only quantify the expected losses but also investigate ways in which shrewd retrofitting of both structural and non-structural elements can have maximum impact on the overall performance. On the contrary, it was shown that by adopting structural retrofitting schemes involving strengthening and/or stiffening of the structure in compliance with NTC 2008 requirements in these situations may actually lead to a worsening of the building performance defined in terms of expected annual loss. Overall, this paper provides insight into the probabilistic seismic assessment and retrofit considerations for existing GLD RC frames in Italy.",Probabilistic seismic assessment and retrofit considerations for Italian RC frame buildings,2018,Assessment; Loss estimation; Retrofitting; Collapse; Gravity-load design; RC frames,INCREMENTAL DYNAMIC-ANALYSIS; INTENSITY MEASURE SELECTION; FRAGILITY CURVES; EARTHQUAKE; VULNERABILITY; COMPONENTS; DESIGN; RISK,0,0
13226,"The current manuscript presents a probabilistic seismic assessment of non-ductile RC structures retrofitted by pre-tensioned aramid fiber reinforced polymers (AFRP). Three RC buildings with different heights (4-, 6- and 8-stories) are designed according to older construction practice and the poorly detailed columns of each model are then retrofitted using pre-tensioned AFRP belts. The numerical finite element models are developed in OpenSees using concentrated plastic hinge models that can capture shear weakness of original columns and deterioration of beams’ stiffness and strength. Incremental dynamic and nonlinear static analyses are performed to quantify structures’ performance in terms of both global- and component-level metrics. The structures’ global response is evaluated using fragility curves, mean annual frequency of collapse, and collapse margin ratios. Furthermore, statistical analyses are performed to obtain median inter-story drift distribution along the height of the structure, structural members’ ductility and dissipated energy under three different seismic hazard levels. The results indicate that retrofitting by pre-tensioned AFRP improves the structure's global-level ductility and reduces the collapse probability significantly. Moreover, it can prevent weak story formation by engaging a larger number of stories in collapse mechanism. From a component-level perspective, pre-tensioned AFRP increases columns’ ductility and dissipated energy and enhances their performance, particularly at near-collapse-limit states. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Probabilistic seismic assessment of non-ductile RC buildings retrofitted using pre-tensioned aramid fiber reinforced polymer belts,2019,Fragility curves; Incremental dynamic analysis; Performance-based earthquake engineering; Pre-tensioned AFRP; Seismic retrofitting; Shear failure,Beams and girders; Building components; Concrete buildings; Deterioration; Ductility; Earthquake engineering; Energy dissipation; Fiber reinforced plastics; Polymers; Reinforced plastics; Reinforcement; Retrofitting; Seismology; Textile fibers; Fragility curves; Incremental dynamic analysis; Performance-based earthquake engineering; Pre-tensioned AFRP; Seismic retrofitting; Shear failure; Aramid fibers,0,0
13227,"The aim of this study is to incorporate the local inelastic demands of a multistory reinforced concrete (RC) frame structure for the first time in the probabilistic seismic assessment of the pounding risk. Two distinct types of structural pounding are examined: a) the floor-to-floor structural pounding - Type A, and b) the inter-story (floor-to-column) structural pounding - Type B. Three different initial gap distances dg between the adjacent structures are considered. The seismic performance of the RC frame structure without the pounding effect is also estimated. The probabilistic evaluation of the pounding effect is performed through fragility curves in terms of global and local engineering demand parameters (EDPs) as a function of the peak ground acceleration (PGA). The first part of this research is focused on the development of global and local probabilistic seismic demand models (PSDMs) against pounding risk. For this purpose, linear and bilinear regression models have been used. Afterwards, the fragility assessment of the RC frame against pounding is performed (a) as a function of the separation gap distance dg, (b) based on the global seismic performances, and (c) based on the local seismic performances. A compounded fragility-based solution on evaluating the pounding risk at different performance levels is also presented and new performance levels thresholds are introduced. Results indicate that the local performances of the columns of the RC structure are crucial demand parameters for the probabilistic assessment of the pounding risk. The type of the structural pounding (Type A or Type B) that is occurred between the adjacent structures significantly alters the results of the probabilistic assessment when the local performances are considered. The compounded evaluation of the pounding risk clearly indicates that the RC frame structure exceeds the examined performance levels at a lower value of PGA when subjected to pounding in comparison to the corresponding cases without pounding. Finally, a decision method is presented as an approach to estimate the minimum separation gap distance dg,min between adjacent structures when global and local performances are incorporated in the fragility assessment process. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Probabilistic seismic assessment of the pounding risk based on the local demands of a multistory RC frame structure,2021,Eurocode 8; Fragility curves; Global engineering demands; Linear and bilinear PSDMs; Local engineering demands; Nonlinear dynamic analyses; Performance levels; Probabilistic assessment; RC frame structure; Structural pounding,Dynamics; Floors; Function evaluation; Regression analysis; Reinforced concrete; Risk assessment; Seismic waves; Structural frames; Eurocode 8; Fragility curves; Global engineering demand; Linear and bilinear probabilistic seismic demand model; Local engineering demand; Non-linear dynamic analysis; Performance:level; Probabilistic assessments; Reinforced concrete frame structures; Structural pounding; Seismology; building code; dynamic analysis; ground motion; multistorey building; probability; reinforced concrete; risk assessment; seismic hazard; seismic pounding,0,0
13228,"Most of buildings and structures are usually projected according to two main axes. However, the geographical position of these buildings varies randomly. Such random distributions of the azimuthal positions of structures, in most of the cities, generally, are not accounted for when assessing their seismic risk; certainly, the direction of the seismic loads is another highly random variable. Moreover, an additional important source of uncertainty is related to the structural response, mainly due to the random character of the mechanical properties. There is a consensus that uncertainties must be considered for adequately assessing the seismic risk of structures, but these directionality effects have not been deeply explored so far. In this article, the influence of the high uncertainty involved in these input variables on the expected seismic damage is analysed. Thus, an actual earthquake, which affected the southern part of Spain, is studied. Notably, damages on a group of affected buildings, located close to the epicentre, are analysed and discussed in detail.

13229,"Probabilistic methods to evaluate the seismic vulnerability of reinforced concrete (RC) frames are largely used in the context of performance based design and assessment, often describing the structural response using global engineering demand parameters (EDPs) such as the maximum interstory drift. While such EDPs are able to synthetically describe the structural behavior, the use of local EDPs is necessary to provide a more realistic and thorough description of failure mechanisms of low-ductility frames lacking seismic details. The objective of this paper is to investigate viable probabilistic seismic demand models of local EDPs, which may be used in developing fragility curves for the assessment of the low-ductility RC frames. The present work explores adequate regression models, probability distributions and uncertainty variation of the demand models. In addition, the adequacy of several ground motion intensity measures (IMs) to be used for predictive modeling of local EDPs is investigated.

13231,"The concrete-filled steel tube (CFT) composite frames using blind bolts and buckling-restrained braces (BRBs) have been studied with the development of building industrialization and energy dissipation technology. However, there has been no research so far on the probabilistic seismic fragility analysis for the blind-bolted end-plate CFT composite frames with BRBs (BRB-BECFT). Therefore, a total of 6-, 9-, 12- and 20-story BRB-BECFT prototype structures were designed based on the performance-based plastic design method. The results obtained from nonlinear static and dynamic analyses indicated that the four structures achieved predefined performance objectives in terms of story drift, joint rotation, and BRB ductility demand. Subsequently, fragility curves including non-collapse and collapse states were established to evaluate the behavior of the structure for a given intensity measure using the incremental dynamic analysis approach. Meanwhile, the geometric mean of spectral acceleration over a period range (Sa,avg) was selected as the intensity measure to assess the structural collapse capacity. Results showed that the adoption of Sa,avg can result in 32–42% lower data dispersion for the determination of collapse point, and simplification of the process of calculation of the collapse margin ratio of a structure. Furthermore, based on the combination of Sa,avg, residual story drift and BRB core plate strain, a framework of probabilistic seismic damage analysis of structures for combined damage evaluation at three levels of the system, subsystem, and component was summarized and conducted by the 6- and 12-story case study. This is practically useful to assess structural damage state after an earthquake because it could present more information on the probability distribution of various damage scenarios. © 2021, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology.",Probabilistic seismic performance evaluation of composite frames with concrete-filled steel tube columns and buckling-restrained braces,2021,Blind bolts; Buckling-restrained braces (BRBs); Concrete-filled steel tube (CFT); Fragility curves; Probabilistic seismic damage analysis,Bolts; Buckling; Composite structures; Energy dissipation; Plates (structural components); Probability distributions; Seismology; Structural analysis; Structural frames; Tubular steel structures; Buckling restrained braces; Building industrializations; Concrete filled steel tube columns; Concrete-filled steel tubes; Incremental dynamic analysis; Seismic fragility analysis; Seismic performance evaluation; Spectral acceleration; Concretes,0,0
13232,"A procedure for the probabilistic assessment of the seismic performance of masonry towers is developed within the general PEER framework. The ingredients identified for the whole procedure are the Intensity Measure (IM), the mechanical model, the seismic procedure, the Engineering Demand Parameter (EDP), the uncertain mechanical parameters, and the probabilistic method. For each one, a choice suitable for masonry towers is proposed. A tower is modeled as a geometrically nonlinear Timoshenko beam with no-tensile and limited-compressive strengths. The reaching of the ultimate compressive strain is assumed as main failure criterion. Pushover analyses are carried out and a performance measure based on the seismic displacement capacity and demand is used as EDP. The conditional probability of exceedance of the EDP given the peak bedrock acceleration, used as IM, is computed through Monte Carlo simulations by considering as random variables the mechanical parameters representative of inertia, stiffness, strength, and ductility of the masonry. The calculations are then developed with reference to a case study. The dispersion of the displacement capacity is recognized as the main source of uncertainty. As to the mechanical parameters, the compressive strength and the strain ductility play the most critical roles, as also highlighted by a sensitivity analysis. These parameters are the most uncertain as destructive tests, usually not allowed in historical monumental buildings, would be required for their assessment. The effects of static load patterns for nonlinear static analysis and the comparison with incremental dynamic analysis are also briefly discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

13233,"A fully probabilistic seismic risk assessment was developed in Manizales, Colombia, considering assets of different types. The first type includes elements that are part of the water and sewage network, and the second type includes public and private buildings. This assessment required the development of a probabilistic seismic hazard analysis that accounts for the dynamic soil response, assembling high resolution exposure databases, and the development of damage models for different types of elements. The economic appraisal of the exposed assets was developed together with specialists of the water utilities company of Manizales and the city administration. The risk assessment was performed using several Comprehensive Approach to Probabilistic Risk Assessment modules as well as the R-System, obtaining results in terms of traditional metrics such as loss exceedance curve, average annual loss, and probable maximum loss. For the case of pipelines, repair rates were also estimated. The results for the water and sewage network were used in activities related to the expansion and maintenance strategies, as well as for the exploration of financial retention and transfer alternatives using insurance schemes based on technical, probabilistic, and prospective damage and loss estimations. In the case of the buildings, the results were used in the update of the technical premium values of the existing collective insurance scheme. © 2017, The Author(s).","Probabilistic Seismic Risk Assessment in Manizales, Colombia: Quantifying Losses for Insurance Purposes",2017,CAPRA; Earthquake insurance; Manizales (Colombia); Probabilistic seismic risk assessment; Risk retention and transfer,building; disaster management; dynamic response; earthquake damage; earthquake event; hazard assessment; insurance system; probability; risk assessment; Caldas; Colombia; Manizales,0,0

13236,"Seismic performance evaluation of existing buildings by probabilistic approach and by deterministic approach has been compared and benefits of probabilistic approach are highlighted. An old building constructed in the 80s and situated in Indian seismic zone V has been taken for the study. Different retrofitting strategies have been implemented to improve global seismic performance. Effectiveness of any retrofitting scheme is assessed by both approaches. Static pushover analysis has been implemented for deterministic approach. For stochastic approach, a probabilistic-based methodology based on Pacific Earthquake Engineering methodology has been developed. The methodology accounts well the associated uncertainties in the process of seismic evaluation. Incremental dynamic analysis-based fragility curves have been developed. It is concluded that probabilistic approach provides comparatively a broad insight into evaluation process and it accounts capacity, demand and modeling uncertainties and is able to predict the seismic performance of retrofitted buildings to futuristic earthquakes. The study also recommends the implementation of performance-based design philosophy based on probabilistic approach in Indian seismic code to match with developing countries’ current design philosophy. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",Probabilistic verses deterministic method of seismic performance evaluation,2018,Fragility curves; Nonlinear modeling; Performance-based design philosophy; Retrofitting techniques; Uncertainties and randomness,None,0,0
13237,"Flood loss modeling is an important component for risk analyses and decision support in flood risk management. Commonly, flood loss models describe complex damaging processes by simple, deterministic approaches like depth-damage functions and are associated with large uncertainty. To improve flood loss estimation and to provide quantitative information about the uncertainty associated with loss modeling, a probabilistic, multivariable Bagging decision Tree Flood Loss Estimation MOdel (BT-FLEMO) for residential buildings was developed. The application of BT-FLEMO provides a probability distribution of estimated losses to residential buildings per municipality. BT-FLEMO was applied and validated at the mesoscale in 19 municipalities that were affected during the 2002 flood by the River Mulde in Saxony, Germany. Validation was undertaken on the one hand via a comparison with six deterministic loss models, including both depth-damage functions and multivariable models. On the other hand, the results were compared with official loss data. BT-FLEMO outperforms deterministic, univariable, and multivariable models with regard to model accuracy, although the prediction uncertainty remains high. An important advantage of BT-FLEMO is the quantification of prediction uncertainty. The probability distribution of loss estimates by BT-FLEMO well represents the variation range of loss estimates of the other models in the case study. © 2016 Society for Risk Analysis","Probabilistic, Multivariable Flood Loss Modeling on the Mesoscale with BT-FLEMO",2017,Damage modeling; multiparameter; probabilistic; uncertainty; validation,Buildings; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Flood control; Flood damage; Housing; Pitting; Probability distributions; Reactor cores; Risk analysis; Risk management; Uncertainty analysis; Damage model; Multiparameters; Probabilistic; Uncertainty; Validation; Floods; decision analysis; flood; model validation; multivariate analysis; probability; residential development; uncertainty analysis; Germany; Saxony; article; decision tree; Germany; prediction; probability; quantitative analysis; river; sensitivity analysis; uncertainty,0,0

13239,"In recent years, many research activities were undertaken to develop a reliable and practical analysis procedure to identify the safety level of existing structures: Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA) is considered to be one of the most accurate methods to estimate the seismic demand and capacity of structures. However, the executions of many complex and computationally heavy nonlinear response history analyses (NL-RHA) are required. This paper deals with the proposal of an efficient Incremental Modal Pushover Analysis (IMPA) to obtain capacity curves by replacing the nonlinear response history analysis of the IDA procedure with Modal Pushover Analysis (MPA). In this work, the MPA is extended and applied to three-dimensional asymmetric structures and finally it is used in order to obtain a ""multimodal"" capacity curve: therefore MPA method is used to evaluate both displacements, as in the standard method, and base shear (this is a novelty). According to this approach the proposed procedure (IMPA) is defined and applied to estimate the structure's seismic response and capacity for given seismic actions. This new procedure is finalized to obtain a capacity curve, as commonly done performing pushover, but it accounts also higher modes effects. Finally IMPA is applied to an existing irregular framed building and compared with NL-RHA.",Proposal and application of the Incremental Modal Pushover Analysis (IMPA),2015,Capacity curve; Existing irregular framed building; Fragility curve; Incremental analysis; Modal pushover analysis; Pushover,Curve fitting; Seismic response; Seismology; Structural design; Capacity curves; Fragility curves; Framed buildings; Incremental analysis; Modal pushover analysis; Pushover; Modal analysis,0,0
13240,"The current AASHTO Guide Specifications for LRFD Seismic Bridge Design and the Seismic Provisions contained in AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications are mainly based on prescriptive design methodologies that only marginally relate important design parameters to the seismic performance of bridges. With the current specifications, a designer does not have direct control over the seismic performance of bridges, other than to ensure that their capacity exceeds the demand. In recent years, there is an emerging need for bridge designers to be able to incorporate multiple levels of seismic performance into bridge design based on owner's input and budgetary considerations. The new performance-based seismic design (PBSD) methodology enables engineers to make informed decisions about the seismic performance of bridges through incorporation of different seismic hazard levels and a multitude of operational expectations. Once incorporated, this design methodology allows designers and owners to better understand and quantify the seismic performance of bridges while considering its post-earthquake designated functions such as instant access by emergency responders or immediate availability for traffic. Although PBSD is relatively well developed for buildings, its application to bridges is still at a nascent stage. There is therefore a need for a clear and consistent approach to relate typical engineering demand parameters (EDPs) like displacements or strains, to potential damage (e.g., concrete spalling and cracks, steel yielding and fractures, instability or excessive elastic or permanent deformations) to the risks associated with such damage (e.g., loss of life, substantial repair costs, and downtime or indirect risks such as productivity slowdown and economic loss). This paper examines some existing knowledge gaps in implementing PBSD to highway bridges and proposes a framework to close some of these gaps. The proposed framework will provide more clarity toward a more meaningful assessment of bridge performance and evaluation of its potential use following an earthquake.",Proposed Framework for the Performance-Based Seismic Design of Highway Bridges,2017,None,FRAGILITY CURVES; TYPICAL BRIDGES; STATES,0,0
13241,"The performance-based earthquake engineering framework utilizes probabilistic seismic demand models to obtain accurate estimates of building engineering demand parameters. These parameters are utilized to estimate earthquake-induced losses in terms of probabilistic repair costs, life-safety impact, and loss of function due to damage to a wide variety of building structural and non-structural components and content. Although nonlinear response history analysis is a reliable tool to develop probabilistic seismic demand models, it typically requires a considerable time investment in developing detailed building numerical model representations. In that respect, the challenge of city-scale damage assessment still remains. This paper proposes a simplified methodology that rapidly assesses the story-based engineering demand parameters (e.g., peak story drift ratios, residual story drift ratios, peak absolute floor accelerations) along the height of a steel frame building in the aftermath of an earthquake. The proposed methodology can be employed at a city-scale in order to facilitate rapid earthquake-induced loss assessment of steel frame buildings in terms of structural damage and monetary losses within a region. Therefore, buildings within an urban area that are potentially damaged after an earthquake event or scenario can be easily identified without a detailed engineering inspection. To illustrate the methodology for rapid earthquake-induced loss assessment at the city-scale we employ data from instrumented steel frame buildings in urban California that experienced the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Maps that highlight the expected structural and nonstructural damage as well as the expected earthquake-induced monetary losses are developed.

13242,"Most mainstream research on assessing building damage using satellite imagery is based on scattered datasets and lacks unified standards and methods to quantify and compare the performance of different models. To mitigate these problems, the present study develops a novel end-to-end benchmark model, termed the pyramid pooling module semi-Siamese network (PPM-SSNet), based on a large-scale xBD satellite imagery dataset. The high precision of the proposed model is achieved by adding residual blocks with dilated convolution and squeeze-and-excitation blocks into the network. Simultaneously, the highly automated process of satellite imagery input and damage classification result output is reached by employing concurrent learned attention mechanisms through a semi-Siamese network for end-to-end input and output purposes. Our proposed method achieves F1 scores of 0.90, 0.41, 0.65, and 0.70 for the undamaged, minor-damaged, major-damaged, and destroyed building classes, respectively. From the perspective of end-to-end methods, the ablation experiments and comparative analysis confirm the effectiveness and originality of the proposed method. Finally, the consistent prediction results of our model for data from the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake verify the high performance of our model in terms of the domain shift problem, which implies that it is effective for evaluating future disasters. © 2019 by the authors.

To investigate those, an SHM system named q-NAVI is introduced as an example. The system has been deployed for 450 buildings, and they experienced a few significant shakings from recent earthquakes.

The elementary cell (REV) is discretized with 24 triangular elastic constant stress elements (bricks) and non-linear interfaces (mortar).

It is shown how the mechanical problem in the unit cell is characterized by very few displacement variables and how the homogenized stress-strain behaviour can be evaluated semi-analytically. At a structural level, it is therefore not necessary to solve a FE homogenization problem at each load step in each Gauss point.

13253,"Rammed earth (RE) is a construction material manufactured from the soil. This material attracts the attention of numerous scientific investigations during the past decade due to its sustainable properties. The performance of RE buildings under horizontal loadings remains an important topic to be investigated. This paper presents an experimental study which identifies the limit states for the in-plane seismic assessment of RE walls. Four RE walls were tested under bi-axial loading: first a vertical force was applied on the top of the wall to simulate the dead and live loads in a building; then a horizontal force pushed at the top the walls to simulate a seismic action. The cracking evolution was recorded by using the DIC (digital image correlation) technique in which the displacement fields were determined by comparing the images taken after and before the loading. Based on the damage evolution observed during the tests and on a similar approach of unreinforced masonries, the present paper proposed four limit states for RE walls corresponding to the inter-storey drift δ: no damage (before LS1) and slight damages (before LS2): δ < 0.1%; moderate damages (before LS3): 0.1% ≤ δ < 0.3%; extensive damage (before LS4): 0.3% ≤ δ < 0.6%; compete damage or collapse (after LS4): δ ≥ 0.6%.

13254,"After a seismic event, it is imperative that critical structural members that are damaged within a building are identified and analyzed as soon as possible to ensure proper remedial measures can be taken. Failure to detect damage or correctly analyze the severity of damage within the building could have catastrophic consequences. When a reinforced concrete building is subjected to a damaging event, the current standard method for identifying and analyzing structural damage involves extensive surface-level visual inspections which often result in inconclusive and inconsistent damage analysis. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a rapidly developing field which is vastly improving the way damage is assessed within buildings and other major infrastructure. In this paper, an automated SHM Damage Detection Model (DDM) specifically tailored for buildings is developed that uses time series analysis along with sensor clustering techniques to detect damage in a building from its vibration response due to ambient wind loading. The specific time series analysis methodology used throughout this paper is an Auto-Regressive Moving Average model with eXogenous inputs (ARMAX). To validate the ARMAX DDM, a detailed wind simulation model that applies forces based on actual wind behavior is created along with a numerical damage model applicable to reinforced concrete buildings. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed DDM in locating and quantifying damage at a story level precision, two buildings are modeled in SAP2000. The results from the numerical modeling proved the effectiveness of the ARMAX DDM at accurately locating and quantifying the degree damage from wind induced floor vibrations at a story level precision. The limitations of the DDM in its current state and recommendations for future work are discussed to conclude the paper. © 2019 Gislason, Mei and Gül.",Rapid and automated damage detection in buildings through armax analysis of wind induced vibrations,2019,ARMAX model; Damage detection; Shear type building; Time series analysis; Wind induced vibration,None,0,0

The result was used further to calculate seismic risk score (SR) which exhibit the probability of the building damage given the Maximum Considered Earthquake (MCER) that will occur during the Rusunawa service life. The in-depth analysis was conducted by developing fragility function expressed in the form of fragility curves for the Rusunawa. The fragility shows the probability that certain damage states will be exceeded given the intensity of earthquakes which will occur during building service life.

13256,"News media provides time and data guarantee for rapid post-disaster assessment. However, disaster information from news media often suffers from semantic ambiguity and conflicting content, and disaster information changes over time. These characteristics of disaster information seriously affect its application in disaster assessment. How to obtain timely reasonable quantitative disaster assessment results based on this kind of disaster information is the key to making full use of media information, but existing studies rarely have addressed the issue. This paper proposes a novel method to assess the percentage of buildings collapse by leveraging timely disaster information with geographical positions. The method includes four parts. First, based on preprocessing of disaster information, the cloud model is used to quantitatively express fuzzy disaster information and construct basic probability assignments (BPAs) for different ranges of buildings collapse. Second, the conflict and ambiguity of each item of disaster information is analyzed, and its credibility is measured. Based on this, the BPAs are modified to reduce conflicting disaster information. Third, multiple items of disaster information are fused by using Dempster-Shafer theory to obtain buildings damage assessment results. Finally, the assessment results of the previous stage are dynamically updated with new information. The method is applied to Ya'an earthquake on April 20, 2013 and Yi'bin earthquake on June 17, 2019. The assessment results are analyzed and compared with those obtained by other methods, and it is found that the method can obtain reliable results in a short time.

13257,"Safety of buildings after a seismic event should be confirmed before resume of occupation. Therefore, the condition of individual buildings need to be evaluated to minimize interference of lives and businesses. However, manual inpection by experts depend on each skill and also time consuming. Structural Health Monitoring provides a means to accelerate the required evaluation. This paper proposed to develop a cost-effective method for rapid damage assessment in buildings after seismic events. First a damage sensitive feature is defined that can distinguish damaged and undamaged structure. An artificial neural network is then explored to describe the complex relationship between the damage sensitive features and the damage index. In this paper, the maximun inter-story drift angle is proposed as a reliable damage index to classify the safety of buildings after seismic events. A five-story steel structure in which the nonlinear floor stiffness is represented by a Bouc-Wen model is developed to validate the proposed strategy.

13260,"After a seismic event, buildings need to be inspected to confirm their safety prior to reoccupation. As such, the rapid evaluation of the condition of individual buildings is important for minimizing disruption to lives and business. However, traditional manual inspection by experts is laborious and time-consuming. Structural health monitoring provides the potential to accelerate the required evaluation. This article proposes a cost-effective approach for rapid safety evaluation of buildings after seismic events using sparse acceleration measurements. First, a damage-sensitive feature is defined that can be used to infer the condition of buildings. Herein, the maximum interstory drift angle is proposed as a reliable damage index to classify the safety of buildings after seismic events. A convolutional neural network is then employed to uncover the complex relationship between the damage-sensitive features and the building condition. A five-story steel building is considered to validate the proposed approach. First, a three-dimensional nonlinear model of the building is created. To generate the required training data, a simplified nonlinear model is developed, along with a corresponding linear model, as use of the three-dimensional model is too computationally expensive. The training data for the convolutional neural network incorporates uncertainties in both the analysis model and the ground motion. Initial evaluation is conducted using the simplified nonlinear model, while final validation of the proposed approach is performed using the results of the three-dimensional nonlinear analysis model subjected to historical earthquakes. The results demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to accommodate differences between the in-situ structure and the analysis model, as well as the efficacy of this approach for rapid postearthquake safety evaluation of buildings.",Rapid postearthquake safety evaluation of buildings using sparse acceleration measurements,2021,Rapid safety evaluation; postearthquake; sparse acceleration measurements; maximum interstory drift angle; safety classification; damage-sensitive features; damage index; convolutional neural network,DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; EARTHQUAKE,0,0
13261,"Conventional knowledge of the flood hazard alone (extent and frequency) is not sufficient for informed decision-making. The public safety community needs tools and guidance to adequately undertake flood hazard risk assessment in order to estimate respective damages and social and economic losses. While many complex computer models have been developed for flood risk assessment, they require highly trained personnel to prepare the necessary input (hazard, inventory of the built environment, and vulnerabilities) and analyze model outputs. As such, tools which utilize open-source software or are built within popular desktop software programs are appealing alternatives. The recently developed Rapid Risk Evaluation (ER2) application runs scenario based loss assessment analyses in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. User input is limited to a handful of intuitive drop-down menus utilized to describe the building type, age, occupancy and the expected water level. In anticipation of local depth damage curves and other needed vulnerability parameters, those from the U.S. FEMA's Hazus-Flood software have been imported and temporarily accessed in conjunction with user input to display exposure and estimated economic losses related to the structure and the content of the building. Building types and occupancies representative of those most exposed to flooding in Fredericton (New Brunswick) were introduced and test flood scenarios were run. The algorithm was successfully validated against results from the Hazus-Flood model for the same building types and flood depths.","RAPID RISK EVALUATION (ER2) USING MS EXCEL SPREADSHEET: A CASE STUDY of FREDERICTON (New Brunswick, Canada)",2016,Building Damage; Exposure; Flood Risk; MS Excel; Vulnerability,None,0,0
13262,"Rapid damage assessment after an earthquake is vital for an efficient emergency response. With the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), they can now be used to rapidly assess the building damage and have the advantages of real-time operation, flexibility, low cost, etc. However, UAV images are ""big data,"" and UAVs can obtain hundreds of scene images in a short period of time. It is, therefore, important to speed up the processing time for UAVimages. This paper proposes a parallel processing approach for accelerating the speed of automatic three-dimensional (3-D) building damage detection, using a preseismic digital topographical map and postseismic UAV images. From the experimental results obtained from 3-D building damage detection of the 2013 Ya'an earthquake in Baoxing County, Sichuan province of China, the comparison of the parallel processing in terms of digital surface model generation using postseismic UAVimages shows that the total cost of the multicores central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing unit-based implementation is about 11.0 times faster than the single-core CPU implementation. © 2015 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.",Rapid three-dimensional detection approach for building damage due to earthquakes by the use of parallel processing of unmanned aerial vehicle imagery,2015,building damage; earthquake; parallel processing; three-dimensional detection; unmanned aerial vehicle imagery,Antennas; Buildings; Computer graphics; Damage detection; Earthquakes; Graphics processing unit; Image coding; Program processors; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Building damage; Digital surface models; Emergency response; Graphics processing; Parallel processing; Real-time operation; Three dimensional detection; Threedimensional (3-d); Aircraft detection,0,0
13264,"The resilience of cities has received worldwide attention. An accurate and rapid assessment of seismic damage, economic loss, and post-event repair time can provide an important reference for emergency rescue and post-earthquake recovery. Based on city-scale nonlinear time-history analysis (THA) and regional seismic loss prediction, a real-time city-scale time-history analysis method is proposed in this work. In this method, the actual ground motion records obtained from seismic stations are input into the building models of the earthquake-stricken area, and the nonlinear time-history analysis of these models is subsequently performed using a high-performance computing platform. The seismic damage to the buildings in the target region subjected to this earthquake is evaluated according to the analysis results. The economic loss and repair time of the earthquake-stricken areas are calculated using the engineering demand parameters obtained from the time-history analysis. A program named, ""Real-time Earthquake Damage Assessment using City-scale Time-history analysis"" (""RED-ACT"" for short) was developed to automatically implement the above workflow.

The aim of this paper is to supply a rapid damage detector designed as a way to aid in risk assessment, damage control and disaster prevention as well as a way to speed the examination of catastrophic effects for emergency studies. The satellite pictures covering the area of interest represent the required bits of information to manage the developed telematics tool. A case study is discussed in order to provide experimental evidence of the proposed procedure potential. Moreover, a multi-view image/video fusion system is integrated in the image process to detect the damage levels of structures to overcome the limitations on the vertical information provided by a satellite.

13266,"Effective post-earthquake response requires a prompt and accurate assessment of earthquake-induced damage. However, existing damage assessment methods cannot simultaneously meet these requirements. This study proposes a framework for real-time regional seismic damage assessment that is based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network architecture. The proposed framework is not specially designed for individual structural types, but offers rapid estimates at regional scale. The framework is built around a workflow that establishes high-performance mapping rules between ground motions and structural damage via region-specific models. This workflow comprises three main parts—namely, region-specific database generation, LSTM model training and verification, and model utilization for damage prediction. The influence of various LSTM architectures, hyperparameter selection, and dataset resampling procedures are systematically analyzed. As a testbed for the established framework, a case study is performed on the Tsinghua University campus buildings. The results demonstrate that the developed LSTM framework can perform damage assessment in real time at regional scale with high prediction accuracy and acceptable variance. © 2020 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering",Real-time regional seismic damage assessment framework based on long short-term memory neural network,2021,None,Brain; Bridge components; Damage detection; Earthquakes; Memory architecture; Network architecture; Structural analysis; Damage assessments; Database generation; Earthquake response; Earthquake-induced damage; Prediction accuracy; Seismic damage assessment; Structural damages; Tsinghua University; Long short-term memory; artificial neural network; earthquake damage; ground motion; seismic response; seismicity,0,0

Therefore, this structural system was the main focus of several European research projects in the past 2 decades. The University of Ljubljana was actively involved in these projects. The key results of the work performed at the University of Ljubljana are presented and discussed in this paper. The main contributions include: a) the development of a new capacity model of beam-column dowel connections, which are one of the critical parts of the RC precast structural system, b) new insight into the cyclic behaviour of fastening systems of concrete cladding panels, and new design procedures for the estimation of strength and displacement capacity of cladding fasteners, c) the development of a methodology for seismic fragility analysis of RC precast buildings, and the fragility curves of precast RC building classes, which can be used for the safety-calibration of the new design procedures of RC precast buildings, and d) the development of a relatively simple and economically attractive back-up (strengthening) system to prevent the falling of panels in case of a strong earthquake. © Copyright © 2021 Zoubek, Babič, Dolšek, Fischinger and Isaković.",Recent Advances in the Research of the Seismic Response of RC Precast Buildings at the University of Ljubljana,2021,dowel beam-to-column connections; frictional beam-to-column connections; masonry infills; precast buildings; precast cladding panels; seismic fragility analysis; seismic restrainers,None,0,0
13268,"Industrial silos are used for storing a huge range of different materials. In the last decades, many of these structures were damaged by natural events, among which the earthquakes were the most significant. Indeed, numerous industrial plants have been built in the territories with high seismicity risk. Most of these plants have been designed and built before the latest updates of the seismic design codes took place, hence their current seismic reliability is questionable. In order to avoid future economic, life-safety and environmental troubles that can be caused by the collapse of these non-building structures, specific retrofitting solutions should be developed and implemented urgently. This paper shows the feasibility of the seismic isolation solution on a typical case study. Seismic vulnerability of an existing industrial steel silo system has been investigated, and a retrofitting solution has been proposed making use of the curved surface single sliding pendulum devices. Incremental dynamic analysis method has been used to compare the performance of the original and the retrofitted solutions. Structural benefits of the seismic isolation solution have been quantified in terms of inelastic deformations, base shear, inter-story drifts and isolator displacements.

13269,"Seismic risk analysis allows investigating the consequences of earthquakes in a region of interest. Most of the existing risk-oriented studies focus on new developments and/or on the integration of most up-to-date information in the fields of seismic hazard evaluation and vulnerability assessment. Conversely, no specific effort was devolved on evaluating the influence of exposure modeling; most of the studies rely on census data at the municipal level for the development of building inventory. Building inventory may change if more information on vulnerability factors for building typologies is considered and this may lead to a different estimation of losses with respect to those based on traditional inventories relying on census data alone. The recent Cartis approach, based on interview, represents an advancement for compilation of regional scale inventories; it allows to rapidly acquire much more data on building typologies with respect to census returns. This paper explores the issue of exposure modeling by comparing the seismic risk computed at the regional scale starting from variable knowledge levels of the building environment. It will be shown that the seismic risk computed starting from the enhanced exposure modeling is generally higher with respect to the standard census-based one. The seismic risk can be nearly doubled for some towns, and the variation is more significant for smaller towns (with smaller number of inhabitants). This result may have a significant influence on evaluations that are based on comparative risk analysis at the regional scale, conditioning decisions towards risk mitigations campaigns or calibration of insurance premiums.",Regional vulnerability and risk assessment accounting for local building typologies,2020,Inventory; Vulnerability; Building typology; Seismic risk; Census; Cartis,SEISMIC HAZARD REGIONS; FRAGILITY CURVES; RC BUILDINGS; DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; GROUND MOTION; INTENSITY; SCALE; THESSALONIKI; DERIVATION; REDUCTION,0,0

A well organized landslide geo-database contains different kinds of data such as past information (landslide inventory maps), ancillary data and updated remote sensing (space-borne and ground based) data, which can be integrated in order to produce landslide susceptibility maps, updated landslide inventory maps and hazard and risk assessment maps. Italy is strongly affected by landslide phenomena which cause victims and significant economic damage to buildings and infrastructure, loss of productive soils and pasture lands. In particular, the Messina Province (southern Italy) represents an area where landslides are recurrent and characterized by high magnitude, due to several predisposing factors (e.g. morphology, land use, lithologies) and different triggering mechanisms (meteorological conditions, seismicity, active tectonics and volcanic activity). For this area, a geodatabase was created by using different monitoring techniques, including remote sensing (e.g. SAR satellite ERS1/2, ENVISAT, RADARSAT-1, TerraSAR-X, COSMO-SkyMed) data, and in situ measurements (e.g. GBInSAR, damage assessment). In this paper a complete landslide geodatabase of the Messina Province, designed following the requirements of the local and national Civil Protection authorities, is presented.

13273,"Quick building damage assessment following disasters such as large earthquakes serves to establish a preliminary estimation of losses and casualties. These datasets are completed by employing several crowdsourcing initiatives, in which volunteers and collaborators map damaged buildings in a given area at a qualitative damage scale based on a post-earthquake aerial or satellite image. Automating this process is a temptation and a technical issue, but manual interpretation remains essential, with the identification of moderate and lateral damage being the key and limiting factor. Following the Haiti 2010 earthquake, many studies were completed by crossing multilayer data gathered from different sources (satellite, aerial, and field survey). These works created a building damage dataset that enabled the construction of different sets of empirical vulnerability functions. In the present study, we proposed to review the datasets used for the damage assessment again, investigate how they can be managed for understanding urban damage patterns, and quantify the potentialities and limits of the sets. A high-resolution map of damage in Port-au-Prince was used to obtain a deducted map of intensity and was then compared to more detailed post-earthquake investigations such as the microzonation of the city (Belvaux et al., 2018). These detailed post-earthquake investigations, in which array microtremor measurements are performed for characterization of the subsurface soil, contribute to a better understanding of local variations in intensity. Subsequently, a retro damage scenario was run, considering the different sets of vulnerability functions (using the RISK-UE methodology vulnerability indexes) fitted with empirical vulnerability functions. Using the characterization of the exposure on a remote sensing basis, the results fit the heaviest damage well (building collapse), but they overestimated moderate damage states compared to the observations. However, is an aerial image based dataset sufficiently exhaustive for moderate damage, which is mostly visible from a lateral or internal point of view? Finally, we suggested some range of adjustments that can be applied to a vulnerability assessment originating from remote sensing data such that it can be used more accurately in the detection of urban damage, even for moderate damage degrees.",Remote sensing vs. field survey data in a post-earthquake context: Potentialities and limits of damaged building assessment datasets,2019,Seismic risk; Vulnerability; Remote sensing; Damage assessment,None,0,0
13274,"Residual displacement demand is a key indicator of seismic damage and plays a pivotal role in post-earthquake decision making on damaged structures. This parameter can be effective as an estimator of the residual capacity of structural systems damaged under seismic sequences. Residual displacement ratio (C-r) is a conventional approach to predict the residual displacement demand from maximum linear displacement. This study investigates the residual displacement ratios of structures as bi-linear SDOF systems subjected to mainshock-aftershock sequences. Constant-strength spectra based on C-r are developed taking into account the effects of ground motion parameters (such as site condition, magnitude, epicentral distance, and duration), and of structural characteristics (such as strength modification factor and post-yield stiffness ratio). Several analytical equations are proposed to predict the residual displacement ratio as function of the elastic vibration period and the strength modification factor for different levels of the post-yield stiffness ratio and also various aftershock intensities. The proposed equations can be employed for seismic assessment of structures against mainshock-aftershock sequences.",Residual displacement ratios of structures under mainshock-aftershock sequences,2019,Residual displacement ratio; Mainshock-aftershock sequences; Nonlinear dynamic analysis; Strength modification factor,POSTEARTHQUAKE DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; CONCRETE GRAVITY DAMS; SDOF SYSTEMS; VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; MULTIPLE EARTHQUAKES; SEISMIC PERFORMANCE; FRAME BUILDINGS; DRIFT DEMANDS; STEEL FRAMES,0,0

13277,"Due to its unique properties within hazard mitigation, shape memory alloy (SMA) has been developed and adopted within the design and retrofit of civil infrastructures to improve the seismic performance. The performance benefit associated with the SMA bridges in a long term has not been well recognized by the decision maker, thus, the wide application of SMA within the civil infrastructures is still limited. This paper aims to apply the resilience and life-cycle loss assessment to the comparative performance assessment of novel and conventional bridges and to promote the application of smart materials within the civil engineering. Both the direct and indirect costs are considered within the life-cycle assessment process. Specifically, the corresponding structural performance, resilience, and life-cycle loss, associated with different bridge systems are addressed. The methodology accounts for the life-cycle loss assessment considering the representative hazard scenarios that could happen within the investigated region.

13279,"In recent decades, numerous contributions have made it possible to implement seismic risk analysis in terms of resilience in order assessing direct and indirect losses both in a short and long-term perspective and in relation to the recovery capacity of buildings. Quantitative approaches to resilience typically require to extend the Performance Based Earthquake Engineering, PBEE, risk analysis framework introducing damage consequences for each relevant component (i.e. structural and non-structural elements, equipment) of the building layout in terms of recovery procedures and the respective times and economic and non-economic efforts. Resilience analysis methodologies can differ from each other for the level of information available in relation to the components of the building and the characterization of their seismic behavior. Refined analysis typically needs an amount of information hardly available in a short time, in which a simplified methodology based on less information required and less algorithm complexity can be more advantageous. The present work aims at investigating the effects of using two resilience analysis methodologies, based on different level of information, for the design optimization of a seismic dissipative system for office six-floor building with steel structure. Dissipative system consists in special braces-frames connections with replaceable energy dissipation elements (they are therefore called DRDs - Dissipative Replaceable Devices). Different structural solutions, defined from different geometrical and mechanical setting combination for devices, were considered. For both methodologies, simulation-based procedure were developed in order to collect best design solutions in terms of resilience behaviour. The two methodologies, named DEEP and RAPID, respectively the refined and the simplified ones, differ in the type of modelling, structural analysis, seismic input, damage models and consequences and extension of evaluable scenarios field. Although they are not completely and directly comparable due to the aforementioned differences, it has been possible to find similarities that confirm the mutual reliability of the two methodologies and give indications on their use. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Resilience-based methodologies for design of steel structures equipped with dissipative devices,2021,Design optimization; Dissipative devices; FEMA P58; Seismic resilience; Steel Structures,Computational complexity; Energy dissipation; Risk analysis; Seismic design; Seismology; Steel structures; Structural analysis; Algorithm complexity; Amount of information; Dissipation elements; Long-term perspective; Non-structural elements; Performance-based earthquake engineering; Quantitative approach; Structural solutions; Risk assessment; dissipation; dynamic response; quantitative analysis; seismic response; steel structure; structural analysis; structural response,0,0
13280,"In this study, a new resilience-based framework is presented for multi-period simultaneous transmission and substation expansion planning (ST&SEP) considering extreme weather-related events (EWEs). The formation of the proposed planning framework falls into a tri-level optimisation problem with the aim of strengthening power network resilience in response to the EWEs. In the lower-level problem, short-term remedial corrective strategies of the independent system operator (ISO) after the EWEs are determined by applying network reconfiguration and generation redispatch. In the intermediate-level problem, an enhanced scenario-building approach is developed to model and analyse the EWEs, as non-random uncertain events, and their subsequent detrimental effects using the notion of the fragility curves corresponding to power network components. In the upper-level problem, however, long-term remedial preventive strategies of the ISO, as network planner, after the EWEs are obtained through integrated decisions between multi-period ST&SEP and transmission switching equipment planning. The newly proposed planning framework is formulated as a large-scale mixed-integer non-linear tri-level optimisation problem and is solved by a powerful symphony orchestra search algorithm in order to obtain the final optimal solution.

13281,"The use of fragility curves for the assessment of seismic losses is in increasing demand, both for pre-earthquake disaster planning as well as post-earthquake recovery and retrofitting programs. Fragility curves; important components of accurate risk assessment are functions that describe the probability of failure, conditioned on the full range of loads to which a system might be exposed. In general fragility curves provide estimates for the probabilities of a structure reaching/ exceeding limiting deformation at given levels of ground shaking or it is a plot of the computed probability (deflection) Vs. Ground motion parameter. The scope of the proposed research is to develop fragility curves as a tool to develop suitable measures that can help in estimating the losses for the structures, which are similar to the case study building and thus to develop the same as an important tool in earthquake engineering mainly for urban risk reduction. The objective of the proposed study is the reliability assessment of the case study building to earthquake loadings through the development of fragility curves. The vulnerability of the structure is expressed with the development of fragility curves, which provides the probability of exceeding a prescribed level of damage for a wide range of ground motion intensities. Primary task is to identify a case study structure for which fragility curves are not developed yet and which could effectively represent the structural viability of present and future buildings. It is based on a concept that similar type of structures (structural typology) will have same probability of a given damage state for given earthquake intensity. Hence effective methods to develop fragility curves for representative buildings are very vital in earthquake engineering. It is proposed to develop fragility curves for a building with flat-slabs and shear wall system which effectively represents recent high rise buildings particularly in GCC countries. This paper presents the work done till date for the development of fragility curves for vulnerability analysis of the case study building.

13283,"Interest in sustainability and resilience of buildings has led to a growing body of literature on merging environmental impact assessment methods with seismic loss estimation methods. Researchers have taken different approaches to connecting the two fields with the common goal of estimating the social, environmental, and economic impacts of damage to buildings subject to seismic events and thus enabling the study of tradeoffs between performance objectives. The differences among these studies include topics such as treatment of uncertainty, types of components and systems considered in the performance assessment, fidelity of structural analysis ranging from region-specific empirical fragility curves to detailed building-specific finite element analysis, scope of life cycle assessment, and so on. One of the aspects of the most diverse treatment has been in obtaining environmental impact data and relating it to pre-use impact estimates. For example, the translation of damage and repairs into life-cycle environmental impacts has been done by one of three approaches: (1) Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA) has been applied to economic loss estimates; (2) repair cost-ratios have been applied to environmental impacts from the pre-use stage; and (3) repair descriptions have been used to model environmental impacts of damage scenarios directly using process life cycle assessment (LCA). All of the approaches are generally accepted but may pose limitations in certain applications and can potentially result in inconsistent conclusions from study to study. A review of existing literature in the area is presented and is followed by a comparative analysis and discussion of the outcomes of taking different environmental life cycle assessment approaches.

13284,"This work reviewed, assessed, enhanced and field-tested one of the most widely used index-based methods for assessing the vulnerability of buildings to tsunamis: the Papathoma Tsunami Vulnerability Assessment (PTVA) model. The review and assessment were undertaken through a participatory survey process engaging authors of scientific literature during 2005–2015 in the field of building vulnerability to tsunamis. Expert respondents updated the weights of the PTVA building vulnerability attributes based on their expertise and insights from the 2011 Tohoku Tsunami. The respondents were also free to suggest additional PTVA building attributes and to provide open comments on the model. We then analysed the outcomes of the questionnaire and we used them to generate a new improved version of the model, the PTVA-4, which we field-tested in the area of Botany Bay (Sydney), New South Wales. Using a cohort of over 2000 buildings and a tsunami scenario numerically simulated using state-of-the-art hydrodynamic modelling techniques, we applied the PTVA-4 model and compared the outcomes against its predecessor (i.e. the PTVA-3). Results showed the PTVA-4 model is significantly more accurate and more sensitive to variations in the tsunami demand parameter, the attributes of the exposed buildings and their surroundings. The PTVA-4 model is the first tool of its kind to integrate the judgment of specialised scientists worldwide. It constitutes a viable option to assess the vulnerability of buildings in areas where no tsunami vulnerability curves have been developed yet, or to consider the contribution to vulnerability given by a significantly wider range of building engineering and physical attributes. An ArcGIS toolbox that automatically calculates the relative vulnerability of buildings using the new PTVA-4 model is attached to this paper. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Revision and improvement of the PTVA-3 model for assessing tsunami building vulnerability using “international expert judgment”: introducing the PTVA-4 model,2016,Building vulnerability; Catastrophe modelling; Fragility curves; PTVA model; Tsunami vulnerability,assessment method; building; catastrophic event; numerical model; tsunami; vulnerability,0,0
13286,"Increasing coastal flooding threatens urban centers worldwide. Projections of physical damages to structures and their contents can characterize the monetary scale of risk, but they lack relevant socioeconomic context. The impact of coastal flooding on communities hinges not only on the cost, but on the ability of households to pay for the damages. Here, we repurpose probabilistic risk assessment to analyze the monetary and social risk associated with coastal flooding in the San Francisco Bay Area for 2020-2060. We show that future coastal flooding could financially ruin a substantial number of households by burdening them with flood damage costs that exceed discretionary household income. We quantify these impacts at the census block group scale by computing the percentage of households without discretionary income, before and after coastal flooding costs. We find that for several coastal communities in San Mateo County more than 50% of households will be facing financial instability, highlighting the need for immediate policy interventions that target existing, socially produced risk rather than waiting for potentially elusive certainty in sea level rise projections. We emphasize that the percentage of financially unstable households is particularly high in racially diverse and historically disadvantaged communities, highlighting the connection between financial instability and inequity. While our estimates are specific to the San Francisco Bay Area, our granular, household-level perspective is transferable to other urban centers and can help identify the specific challenges that different communities face and inform appropriate adaptation interventions.","Rising Seas, Rising Inequity?

13288,"Romania has one of the highest seismic hazard levels in Europe. The seismic hazard is due to a combination of local crustal seismic sources, situated mainly in the western part of the country and the Vrancea intermediate-depth seismic source, which can be found at the bend of the Carpathian Mountains. Recent seismic hazard studies have shown that there are consistent differences between the slopes of the seismic hazard curves for sites situated in the fore-arc and back-arc of the Carpathian Mountains. Consequently, in this study we extend this finding to the evaluation of the probability of collapse of buildings and finally to the development of uniform risk-targeted maps. The main advantage of uniform risk approach is that the target probability of collapse will be uniform throughout the country. Finally, the results obtained are discussed in the light of a recent study with the same focus performed at European level using the hazard data from SHARE project. The analyses performed in this study have pointed out to a dominant influence of the quantile of peak ground acceleration used for anchoring the fragility function. This parameter basically alters the shape of the risk-targeted maps shifting the areas which have higher collapse probabilities from eastern Romania to western Romania, as its exceedance probability increases. Consequently, a uniform procedure for deriving risk-targeted maps appears as more than necessary. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Risk-targeted maps for Romania,2018,Fragility curves; Probability of collapse; Seismic hazard; Share; Uncertainty,building; collapse; mapping; peak acceleration; probability; risk assessment; seismic hazard; uncertainty analysis; Carpathians; Romania,0,0
13289,"The seismic performance of unanchored slender contents at various floor levels within a building has received little attention in the literature, despite earthquake reconnaissance reports routinely emphasizing the overturning of contents as a pervasive problem. This paper investigates the rocking response of building contents in a four-story concentrically braced frame building, focusing on how the variation in horizontal and vertical floor accelerations in the building affects the planar pure rocking demands (sliding and bouncing are not considered). A cascading dynamic analysis approach is taken whereby nonlinear response history analyses of a three-dimensional (3D) building model to a suite of ground motions provides the floor accelerations, which are in turn used to develop rocking spectra for assessing demands on unanchored building contents of various sizes and aspect ratios. The effect of the vertical floor excitation on the peak rocking response is found to be negligible for most practical purposes, especially for slender components. Consequently, rocking demands on an object are not affected by where it is placed on a specific floor. Rocking demands on an object increase at higher floors because horizontal floor accelerations are amplified with elevation, but the difference in rocking demands from one floor to the next are significantly more pronounced for stocky than for slender objects. Finally, the paper develops analytical fragility curves for rocking and overturning limit states using the normalized peak rotation angle as the demand parameter and a physically motivated floor intensity measure based on the peak floor velocity, block size, and slenderness. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Rocking Response of Unanchored Building Contents Considering Horizontal and Vertical Excitation,2020,Building contents; Fragility curves; Nonstructural components; Overturning; Rocking; Unanchored equipment,Aspect ratio; Buildings; Earthquakes; Concentrically braced frames; Earthquake reconnaissance; Floor accelerations; Horizontal floor accelerations; Nonlinear response history analysis; Seismic Performance; Three-dimensional (3D) buildings; Vertical excitation; Floors,0,0
13290,"Identification and monitoring of buildings are of considerable practical value in three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of building models and urbanization monitoring. Especially for the change detection of buildings with composite structures and relief displacements, heterogeneous appearance and positional inconsistencies are two outstanding issues. In this work, a novel roof-cut approach is developed using graph-based model to locate rooftops and demolished buildings through the use of imagery and preexisting building footprint maps. The building region, boundary, and rooftop contour constraint terms were first formulated by multiple cues derived from both data sources. Next, roof-cut segmentation was performed by gathering all terms required for high-quality unsupervised rooftop extraction. Finally, the positional displacement statistics of similar adjacent buildings were collected to accurately estimate the rooftop location and achieve building demolition detection with the overlap ratio index. Experimental results indicated the effectiveness and generality of the proposed roof-cut algorithm for aerial and satellite images.",Roof-Cut Guided Localization for Building Change Detection from Imagery and Footprint Map,2019,None,REMOTELY-SENSED IMAGES; DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; AERIAL IMAGES; EXTRACTION; EARTHQUAKE; AREAS,0,0

The results are then assessed in term of geometric accuracy comparing them with a cadastral point height dataset, used as benchmark. The comparison, in terms of difference height values (between the DSM and the benchmark), is calculated on a set of sample points.

13292,"This paper examines two different procedures for the seismic appraisal of the ruinous medieval St. Mary of Carmel stone masonry church in Famagusta, Cyprus. A detailed survey that included field tests for the identification of the modal characteristics of the structure together with laboratory and in situ tests for assessing the composition and properties of the monumental materials was performed. The results were used for the formulation and calibration of a finite element model representing the monument. The seismic behavior of the latter was examined via nonlinear static and time-history analysis. It was found that due to the lack of spatial continuity and the absence of a roof diaphragm, various parts of the monument tend to act as discrete macroblocks and localized failure mechanisms occur. Comparisons made between the results yielded by the different analysis methods, revealed that the implicit dynamic approach gives more realistic predictions of damage distribution. Nevertheless, the ultimate collapse modes obtained by both methods show relatively good agreement and are in line with field observations. Capacity estimations suggest that the case-study monument fails to satisfy regional seismic demands and underline the high vulnerability exhibited by heritage ruins. It is thus concluded that further research is required in order to develop procedures particularly suited to the seismic appraisal of heritage ruins and to the design of appropriate interventions for collapse prevention.",Seismic appraisal of heritage ruins: The case study of the St. Mary of Carmel church in Cyprus,2020,Heritage ruins; Masonry church; Inspection and diagnosis; Modal identification test; FE model calibration; Damaged plasticity; Pushover analysis; Nonlinear time-history analysis; Seismic safety assessment,PLASTIC-DAMAGE MODEL; LIME-MORTAR MASONRY; PUSHOVER ANALYSIS; FAILURE ANALYSIS; BEHAVIOR; VULNERABILITY; PERFORMANCE; BUILDINGS; STRENGTH; CONCRETE,0,0
13293,"Extensive damage to school buildings has been observed during past earthquakes in Italy and there is a need to better understand their potential vulnerability. As part of a national project to assess seismic risk in Italian schools, a database was compiled in terms of characteristics such as school location and construction typology. This paper examines a number of these buildings considered to be a representative sample of the Italian school building population. To quantify their seismic vulnerability, the induced damage with respect to increased shaking intensity need to be quantified. This characterisation of the building vulnerability, in combination with the seismic hazard, allows more informed, risk-based decisions to be made using performance metrics such as expected annual loss (EAL). This article outlines a case study application quantifying the EAL and collapse safety for three school buildings representative of the Italian school building stock. Detailed numerical models were developed using information collected during in-situ inspections in order to accurately represent the dynamic response of the school structures. To estimate economic losses, a structural and non-structural element inventory was compiled using in-situ survey information. This case study application is conducted in a systematic fashion to clearly illustrate the various details required to implement more advanced seismic assessment studies. Finally, a comparison is made with the seismic classification guidelines recently introduced in Italy to provide further insight into how these can be used to identify existing buildings vulnerable to excessive damage and potential collapse during earthquakes.",Seismic assessment and loss estimation of existing school buildings in Italy,2018,Seismic assessment; Loss estimation; Vulnerability; School buildings; Collapse,MASONRY BUILDINGS; FRAGILITY CURVES; EARTHQUAKE; PERFORMANCE; LAQUILA; WALLS,0,0

In the framework of the Performance Based Earthquake Engineering the probabilistic estimation of monetary loss can be used as meaningful indicators of the building’s performance. In this work, a seismic loss assessment approach is defined for old Reinforced Concrete buildings and applied to an old Reinforced Concrete wall-frame building in Lisbon. The building presents non-ductile detailing typical of buildings designed before the introduction of modern seismic codes (pre– 1980). The analytical methodology, which uses multiple stripe analysis, is used for the building case study and different retrofitting strategies are identified and selected, in order to improve its seismic performance.

13295,"The performance of heavy-timber structures in earthquakes depends strongly on the inelastic behavior of the mechanical connections. Nevertheless, the nonlinear behavior of timber structures is only considered in the design phase indirectly through the use of an R-factor or a q-factor, which reduces the seismic elastic response spectrum. To improve the estimation of this, the seismic performance of a three-story building designed with ring-doweled moment resisting connections is analyzed here. Connections and members were designed to fulfill the seismic detailing requirements present in Eurocode 5 and Eurocode 8 for high ductility class structures. The performance of the structure is evaluated through a probabilistic approach, which accounts for uncertainties in mechanical properties of members and connections. Nonlinear static analyses and multi-record incremental dynamic analyses were performed to characterize the q-factor and develop fragility curves for different damage levels. The results indicate that the detailing requirements of Eurocode 5 and Eurocode 8 are sufficient to achieve the required performance, even though they also indicate that these requirements may be optimized to achieve more cost-effective connections and members. From the obtained fragility curves, it was verified that neglecting modeling uncertainties may lead to overestimation of the collapse capacity. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Seismic assessment of a heavy-timber frame structure with ring-doweled moment-resisting connections,2018,Fragility functions; Ring-doweled connections; Seismic assessment; Timber moment frames,Cost effectiveness; Q factor measurement; Seismology; Timber; Uncertainty analysis; Elastic response spectra; Fragility function; Incremental dynamic analysis; Moment frames; Moment-resisting connection; Non-linear static analysis; Probabilistic approaches; Seismic assessment; Seismic design; design; elastic modulus; estimation method; nonlinearity; performance assessment; seismic response; structural response; timber,0,0
13296,"A study on the seismic ductility demands on square HSS braces in special concentrically braced frames (SCBFs) is presented to address the seismic risk of braces in existing SCBF buildings designed according to both previous and current AISC Seismic Provisions. First, the paper discusses the development of ductility-based fragility curves by employing specimens with various width-to-thickness and slenderness ratios collected from 16 experimental programs from 1978 to today. Second, the constructed fragility curves are used to estimate the vulnerability of square HSS braces to the damage state of fracture using the brace ductility demand as engineering demand parameter. Then, the seismic risk of braces in terms of fatigue life is evaluated under 30 earthquake ground motions using a seven-story office building designed following requirements of previous and current design practice. The study concludes that braces in SCBF designed in compliance with the previous and current AISC Seismic Provisions are subject to a high probability of fracture under earthquake ground motions characterized by different intensity levels, which in turn might lead to underestimation of the overall seismic risk. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Seismic assessment of ductile concentrically braced frames with HSS bracings,2019,Concentrically braced frames; Ductility capacity; Fragility analysis; Incremental dynamic analysis; Probability of fracture; Seismic evaluation; Square HSS braces; Width-to-thickness ratio,Ductility; Fracture; Office buildings; Seismic design; Structural frames; Concentrically braced frames; Ductility capacity; Fragility analysis; Incremental dynamic analysis; Probability of fractures; Seismic evaluation; Square HSS braces; Width-to-thickness ratio; Earthquakes; assessment method; building; ductility; dynamic analysis; earthquake damage; fracture; ground motion; probability; seismic design; seismicity; structural component,0,0
13298,"The conventional force-based design (FBD) method has been in practice for seismic assessment of RC building frames. In the FBD method, the main focus is on the seismic forces over the structure. In recent years, various shortcomings have been pointed out by research works, for example assumed initial stiffness of structural components, inappropriate response reduction factors, etc. To overcome these limitations of FBD, many new techniques have been developed and implemented. One such method is the direct-displacement-based design (DDBD) method. In this, the basic assumption is that strength is less critical than displacement. DDBD is a design theory in which design criteria are articulated for achieving a specified level of performance goals that are subjected to the defined level of seismic hazards. In this paper, the vulnerability of buildings situated in high seismic regions in India has been assessed. Four- and eight-storey RC building frames are taken into consideration. The non-linear time-history analysis is carried out, and the inelastic behaviour of buildings in the form of base shear, inter-storey drift ratio (ISDR) and maximum displacement is assessed. Also, fragility curves have been developed considering the effect of ISDR. It is concluded that the DDBD approach is more reliable and efficient for designing RC building frames as compared to its counterpart FBD approach. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Seismic assessment of RC building frames using direct-displacement-based and force-based approaches,2020,Direct-displacement-based design; Fragility curves; Inter-storey drift; RC building frames; Time-history analysis,None,0,0
13299,"The influence on the seismic behavior of RC shear walls by axial loads is evaluated and the observed damage in the earthquake damage investigation of RC shear walls is reproduced in this paper. Six RC shear walls with aspect ratio of 2 were analyzed by the method of nonlinear finite element under different axial load ratios, and the suggested modeling techniques and the accuracy of the numerical method were verified. The seismic performance of shear walls including load displacement responses, ductility performance, stiffness degradation and energy dissipation capacity were discussed. The analysis results indicate that axial load has a significant effect on the seismic performance of RC shear walls. On the basis of this, the qualitative and quantitative relationships between the development of material damage and the deterioration of component performance were analyzed. It realizes the cross-scale conversion of damage information about structural components of RC shear wall from the local material scale to the component scale. Then the cross-scale refinement model of damage evolution of RC shear walls in the whole process was established, simplified and verified. The results show that, the refinement model can explain the development and distribution of damage evolution of RC shear walls in the whole process quickly and easily.

13301,"Hollow spirally welded pipes (SWP) have been used widely as piles for the foundations of buildings, bridges, and flood wall structures. These members have limited ductility due to extensive local buckling and denting when subjected to seismic loading. In cases where improved seismic performance and ductility is required, the SWP are filled, fully or partially, with concrete. Fully filled SWP are called CF-SWP, while partially filled SWP are referred as CPF-SWP. Researchers have experimentally investigated the structural behavior of SWP and CF-SWP. However, there is lack of benchmarked numerical models that can be used to investigate the seismic behavior of SWP, CF-SWP or CPF-SWP, and lack of research regarding the seismic behavior and ductility of CPF-SWP. This paper develops and benchmarks detailed 3D finite element method (FEM) models for evaluating the seismic behavior of SWP, CF-SWP, and CPF-SWP. The FEM models account for behavioral complexities such as steel yielding, pipe local buckling and fracture, concrete cracking and crushing, cyclic stiffness degradation and recovery, and effects of concrete confinement. The FEM models for both the hollow SWP and filled CF-SWP are benchmarked using experimental data available in the literature. The benchmarked models are used to investigate the seismic behavior and ductility of the partially filled CPF-SWP, which include the transition from hollow SWP to filled CF-SWP. These investigations show that the infill ratio (Lc/L) has a significant influence on the seismic behavior of CPF-SWP. Increasing the infill ratio delays the steel pipe local buckling and fracture, and improves the stiffness, strength, ductility, and energy dissipation capacity. Fully filling the plastic hinge region with concrete can significantly improve the seismic behavior of CPF-SWP.",Seismic behavior and modeling of concrete partially filled spirally welded pipes (CPF-SWP),2017,None,MEMBERS EXPERIMENTAL DATABASE; PLASTIC-DAMAGE MODEL; BRIDGE PIERS; NONCOMPACT; COLUMNS,0,0

Once an earthquake occurs, it will cause a serious earthquake disaster of the nonstructural components in the large public buildings, and then affect the use function of buildings, lead to huge economic losses, and even pose potential threats to the evacuation and resettlement of people.

13305,"A high percentage of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings in Portugal were designed and built before the introduction of modern seismic codes. This research aims to assess the seismic capacity and vulnerability of RC buildings in the city of Lisbon. For that purpose, nonlinear static procedures have been used and fragility curves have been developed. These buildings are reaching the end of their nominal life. Therefore, ageing effects have been taken into account, as well as the presence of smooth rebar. To do so, a sensitivity analysis has been performed by considering the chloride-induced corrosion of the reinforcement steel rebar and the degradation of the concrete cover. To illustrate the effects of ageing and the procedure adopted for the seismic fragility assessment of old RC structures, three RC buildings with masonry infills have been selected as case studies. They were all built between 1960 and 1980, and they are representative of the current building stock in Lisbon.

Results have shown that the concrete strength degradation has had more influence than reduction of the rebar diameter in the seismic capacity.

13307,"This study serves to estimate the seismic capacity of the reinforced concrete containment building considering its bidirectional cyclic effect and variations of energy. The implementation of the capacity estimation has been performed by extending two well-known methods: nonlinear static pushover and incremental dynamic analysis. The displacement and dissipated energy demands are obtained from the static pushover analysis considering bidirectional cyclic effect. In total, 18 bidirectional earthquake intensity parameters are developed to perform the incremental dynamic analysis for the reinforced concrete containment building. Results show that the bidirectional static pushover analysis tends to decrease the capacity of the reinforced concrete containment building in comparison with unidirectional static pushover analysis. The 5% damped first-mode geometric mean spectral acceleration strongly correlates with the maximum top displacement of the containment building. The comparison of the incremental dynamic analysis and static pushover curves is employed to determine the seismic capacity of the reinforced concrete containment building.

This assessment investigates the three- and six-story of regular RC MRF building systems, with and without unreinforced masonry infill wall, representing low- to mid-rise structures. These buildings are designed according to the current National Building Code of Canada and detailed based on the 2014 Canadian Standards Association A23.3 standard provision for high seismic regions. Two different ductility classes of seismic building design, namely ductile and moderately ductile, are considered to identify the capability, equality, and/or difference of the seismic performance of these designed buildings. Nonlinear dynamic analysis is applied in the performance-based seismic assessment procedures to assess the collapse response of structural for the set of 50 pair ground motion records. Next, the seismic fragility curves are developed through incremental dynamic analysis. Finally, mean annual frequency of collapse is calculated through combination of fragility curve and hazard curve. The results indicate that the bare RC buildings are vulnerable to earthquake-induced collapse when the number of the story increased. The presence of the URM infill walls significantly influence the collapse behavior of the frame structure. Compared to moderately ductile MRF buildings, ductile MRF buildings show a better collapse performance, are strongly influenced by the capacity of the building system. © 2018 Noh and Tesfamariam.",Seismic collapse risk assessment of code-conforming rc moment resisting frame buildings designed with 2014 canadian standard association standard A23.3,2018,Code-conforming building; Collapse risk; Fragility curve; Masonry infill walls; Moment resisting frame; National Building Code of Canada; Nonlinear analysis; Reinforced concrete buildings,None,0,0
13309,"The predominant building configurations in the seismically active Indian Himalayan region comprise of vertically irregular buildings located on hillside slopes. Buildings in hilly topography are often constructed with foundations at multiple levels, such as ones with foundations split at two levels or stepped foundations, requiring columns of varying height to accommodate the ground slope. This introduces vertical irregularity over the height of the structure, making them more susceptible to collapse as compared to regular buildings on flat grounds. To ensure the life safety of the building occupants, this study evaluates the adequacy of modern Indian seismic codes in preventing collapse under earthquake shaking, focussing on predominant hillside reinforced concrete building configurations located on plains, gradual slopes, and steep slopes. Incremental dynamic analysis is carried on nonlinear analytical building models, and seismic collapse fragility curves are developed. Fragility analysis indicates buildings located on a gradual slope with stepped foundation are most susceptible to collapse among all configurations, with median collapse capacity 31% lower than their counterparts on flat grounds. For this building configuration, parameters influencing collapse fragility metrics are further investigated through a multiple linear regression model. The study further investigates the seismic collapse risk of buildings located in different cities of the Indian Himalayan region using collapse margin ratio (CMR) and the probability of collapse in 50 years that is not investigated for Indian buildings previously. It is observed that probability of collapse in 50 years for buildings in most of the cities considered in the study is greater than 1%, exceeding the threshold of uniform building collapse risk as per US codes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Seismic collapse risk of reinforced concrete hillside buildings in Indian Himalayan belt,2021,Hillside buildings; Nonlinear dynamic analysis; Seismic collapse risk; Vertical irregularity,Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Earthquakes; Foundations; Linear regression; Topography; Building configuration; Collapse capacities; Collapse fragilities; Earthquake shaking; Fragility analysis; Incremental dynamic analysis; Irregular buildings; Multiple linear regression models; Reinforced concrete; collapse; dynamic analysis; reinforced concrete; seismic hazard; United States,0,0
13310,"This study applies the latest probabilistic performance-based earthquake engineering tools in terms of nonlinear dynamic analyses in tandem with hazard-consistent record selection to assess the risk of collapse of RC tall buildings in the Istanbul metropolitan area and to quantify their seismic safety margin with respect to acceptable risk levels. Statistically representative archetype buildings selected from an extensive inventory form the basis for this assessment study. Accordingly, we chose five hypothetical building sites in Istanbul where tall buildings are densely populated to estimate the risk of collapse for 5 x 5 = 25 building-and-site specific cases. The results showed an average 10% probability of collapse under the ground-motion intensities with 2% probability of exceedance in 50 years. The mean annual rates of collapse range between 0.1 x 10(-4) and 6.1 x 10(-4) with an average of 1.7 x 10(-4), which remains below the tolerable risk threshold value of 2.0 x 10(-4) envisioned by the FEMA's Building Seismic Safety Council. However, 36% of the analyzed cases yielded collapse rates higher than this tolerable risk. Among the considered cases, the core walls and frame building was identified as the best design choice from a collapse safety point of view while the tunnel form archetype raised concern by exhibiting substantially higher collapse risk compared to other archetypes.",Seismic collapse risk of reinforced concrete tall buildings in Istanbul,None,Seismic collapse risk; Collapse fragility curves; RC tall buildings; Istanbul,AVERAGE SPECTRAL ACCELERATION; MOTION SELECTION ALGORITHM; FRAGILITY FUNCTIONS; INTENSITY MEASURE; VULNERABILITY; EARTHQUAKES; THRESHOLD; SCALAR; ISSUES; MODEL,0,0
13311,"In this study the seismic collapse safety of five different types of SMA-RC beam-column joints is compared with regular steel-RC beam-column joints through numerical analysis. Nonlinear static push over analysis is performed for all types of beam-column joints to determine the performance limit states of these connections. From the push over analysis, a damage state framework is proposed considering the maximum drift limit corresponding to different performance criteria such as cracking, yielding, spalling, and crushing. Through incremental dynamic analysis (IDA), collapse fragility curves are developed to assess the collapse performance of SMA-RC beam-column joints and conventional steel-RC beam-column joints using twenty earthquake ground motions. The collapse safety assessment is expressed in terms of collapse margin ratio considering maximum and residual drift as the demand parameters. The collapse margin ratio of SMA-RC beam-column joints is 20-30% greater than steel-RC beam-column joints in terms of maximum drift, and 25-60% higher in terms of residual drift.",Seismic collapse safety assessment of concrete beam-column joints reinforced with different types of shape memory alloy rebars,2020,Shape memory alloy; Collapse fragility; Collapse margin ratio; Maximum drift; Residual drift,HIGHWAY BRIDGES; PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR; RISK; METHODOLOGY,0,0
13312,"Reinforced concrete (RC) moment frames supported on two ground levels have been widely constructed in mountainous areas with medium to high seismicity in China. In order to investigate the seismic collapse behavior and risk, a scaled frame model was tested under constant axial load and reversed cyclic lateral load. Test results show that the failure can be induced by the development of story yielding at the first story above the upper ground. The strong column and weak beam mechanism can be well realized at stories below the upper ground. Numerical analysis model was developed and calibrated with the test results. Three pairs of six case study buildings considering various structural configurations were designed and analyzed, showing similar dynamic characteristics between frames on two ground levels and flat ground of each pair. Incremental dynamic analyses (IDA) were then conducted to obtain the seismic collapse fragility curves and collapse margin ratios of nine analysis cases designated based on the case study buildings, considering amplification of earthquake effect and strengthening measures. Analysis results indicate that the seismic collapse safety is mainly determined by the stories above the upper ground. The most probable collapse mechanism may be induced by the story yielding of the bottom story on the upper ground level. The use of tie beam and column strengthening can effectively enhance the seismic collapse safety of frames on two ground levels. © 2018 Techno-Press, Ltd.",Seismic collapse safety of high-rise RC moment frames supported on two ground levels,2018,Collapse; Earthquake; Fragility; Incremental dynamic analysis; Irregularity; Moment frame,Concrete beams and girders; Dynamics; Reinforced concrete; Safety engineering; Collapse; Fragility; Incremental dynamic analysis; Irregularity; Moment frames; Earthquakes,0,0
13313,"Earthquakes are generally clustered, both in time and space. Conventionally, each cluster is made of foreshocks, the mainshock, and aftershocks. Seismic damage can possibly accumulate because of the effects of multiple earthquakes in one cluster and/or because the structure is unrepaired between different clusters. Typically, the performance-based earthquake engineering (PBEE) framework neglects seismic damage accumulation. This is because (i) probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) only refers to mainshocks and (ii) classical fragility curves represent the failure probability in one event, of given intensity, only. However, for life cycle assessment, it can be necessary to account for the build-up of seismic losses because of damage in multiple events. It has been already demonstrated that a Markovian model (i.e., a Markov chain), accounting for damage accumulation in multiple mainshocks, can be calibrated by maintaining PSHA from the classical PBEE framework and replacing structural fragility with a set of state-dependent fragility curves. In fact, the Markov chain also works when damage accumulates in multiple aftershocks from a single mainshock of known magnitude and location, if aftershock PSHA replaces classical PSHA. Herein, this model is extended further, developing a Markovian model that accounts, at the same time, for damage accumulation: (i) within any mainshock-aftershock seismic sequence and (ii) among multiple sequences.

13317,"Peru is constantly subjected to severe earthquakes due to its close location to the Ring of Fire. Analysis of historical records as well as the study of the performance of structural systems have served as a basis for the development of seismic design code provisions. The main goal of these provisions is to reduce seismic risk. The lack of housing in Peru and the growth of population are the reasons for permanent housing demand. Thin-walled reinforced concrete dwellings are mostly preferred by contractors and builders due to their short execution time, simple construction procedures and minimum construction costs. It is known that these thin walls have very limited ductility because of the properties of the one-layer reinforcing steel layout. There is an almost 50-year seismic gap in the north region of Peru, where most of the thin-walled buildings are built. Hence, these thin-walled dwellings have not been subjected to strong accelerations yet. Therefore, we do not have enough information about their performance. Some laboratory tests have been carried out to assess the mechanical properties of individual natural scale walls. These tests were conducted under the provisions of FEMA 461. This paper mainly focuses on the development of fragility curves for thin-walled buildings. In this research, fragility curves are generated by a Montecarlo simulation technique. Fragility curves are generated for 2 types of building layouts. Type 1 consists of three 2-story blocks which share dividing walls and Type 2 considers a 3-story independent block. These are the most common layouts offered by the current housing market and have been built since the 90s. These dwellings are usually built on S2-type soil, which is and intermediate between soft soil and rock. The most important contribution is the probabilistic approach used in this method. This considers randomness and uncertainty of mechanical properties of the materials involved such as compressive concrete strength and yield stress of the reinforcing steel. Also, this approach is applied to the seismic demand through the generation of artificial ground motion signals. Both types of structures show excellent performance during the design earthquake. © 11th National Conference on Earthquake Engineering 2018, NCEE 2018: Integrating Science, Engineering, and Policy.

13318,"This paper proposes a new model to quantify the enhancement effect of confinement elements on the seismic behavior of confined masonry (CM) structures. Using this model, a combined assessment index considering the effects of material strength and the confinement elements on the seismic performance of masonry structures is developed to assess the potential damage of the structures subjected to seismic loads. A field survey of the Wenchuan earthquake is used to calibrate the proposed index and traditional wall density index. The relationship between the two indexes and the damage categories of unreinforced masonry (URM) and CM structures at different seismic intensity zones is discussed. Results show that the two indexes both predict the damage of CM and URM structures well, while the proposed combined index is verified with a better prediction accuracy. Using the two indexes, a complete assessment procedure is proposed for predicting the damage of the URM and CM structures at VIII to X seismic intensity zones. Case studies of two CM buildings at different seismic intensity zones are conducted to explain how to use the proposed assessment procedure and verify its feasibility. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Seismic Damage Assessment Indexes for Masonry Structures,2019,Confinement of masonry structures; Damage prediction; Seismic assessment; Strength and ductility,Earthquakes; Forecasting; Masonry materials; Structural analysis; Assessment procedure; Damage prediction; Effects of materials; Masonry structures; Seismic assessment; Seismic damage assessment; Strength and ductilities; Unreinforced masonry; Damage detection,0,0
13319,"Damage prediction of existing buildings against natural events is a challenge for engineers. Although several approaches have been proposed in the bibliography for damage assessment of steel and concrete structures, more studies are required to survey the damage state of masonry buildings. In this research, seismic damage of a historical masonry building, named Arge-Tabriz, has been assessed using region-specified simulated ground motion records. The main goal of the research is to predict the damage levels of Arge-Tabriz monument under probable earthquakes. Potential scenario earthquakes with different magnitudes are simulated to evaluate the seismic damage of the Arge-Tabriz building. For ground motion simulation of the scenario earthquakes, the stochastic finite-fault methodology, which employs a finite-fault approach comprised of point-source models, is used. The building is modeled using macro-modeling approach; and for the masonry material, concrete damaged plasticity constitutive model is utilized. After performing nonlinear dynamic analyses of the model in ABAQUS commercial software, the damage state of the building is assesses through failure area and failure volume methods, Park-Ang damage index, performance limits proposed by FEMA 356, and finally tensile damage variable DAMAGET as ABAQUS output variable. The accuracy of the employed numerical method is verified through comparison of the developed damage patterns with the existing damage patterns of the building. The results disclose that failure area and failure volume indices have the highest accuracy, while the drift limits of FEMA 356 have the lowest precision to predict the damage level of the building. The application of region-specific simulated scenario earthquakes reveals that the building has adequate strength to resist against weak seismic events and it experiences moderate damage, keeping up its whole stability under moderate potential events; while it is susceptible to collapse against severe earthquakes, and therefore, a rehabilitation scheme seems to be essential for preserving this valuable heritage. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Seismic damage assessment of a historic masonry building under simulated scenario earthquakes: A case study for Arge-Tabriz,2021,ABAQUS; Ancient masonry; Arge-tabriz; Damage assessment; Scenario earthquakes,ABAQUS; Concrete buildings; Earthquakes; Faulting; Forecasting; Masonry materials; Numerical methods; Stochastic systems; Ancient masonry; Arge-tabriz; Damage assessments; Damage level; Damage state; Failure volumes; Masonry building; Scenario earthquakes; Seismic damage; Seismic damages assessment; Damage detection; computer simulation; dynamic response; earthquake damage; earthquake event; fault zone; finite element method; ground motion; masonry; seismic response; software,0,0
13320,"A tubed mega frame structure is composed of tubes located at the perimeter of the structure as mega columns and mega beams. This paper explores the applicability of this structural system to supertall buildings in high seismic intensity areas. First, a refined finite element (FE) model of a 585-m tall tubed mega frame structure was built in ABAQUS, as well as a mega-braced frame-core structure on which the tubed mega frame structure is based. In order to improve the efficiency of nonlinear analyses, beam-based simplified FE models of the two structures were developed in OpenSees and validated against the refined FE models. Then, incremental dynamic analyses of the tubed mega frame structure were conducted based on its simplified model. The damage of the tubes was quantified by a modified Park–Ang damage model. The analyses indicate that the seismic damage of the tubes in the tubed mega frame structure develops rapidly after yielding, because tubes at the perimeter of the structure suffer severe axial load under high-intensity earthquakes. It is suggested that the axial load ratio of the tubed mega columns should be controlled to avoid brittle failure in the seismic design of supertall tubed mega frame structures. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Seismic damage assessment of a supertall tubed mega frame structure based on a simplified finite element model,2021,incremental dynamic analyses; Park–Ang damage model; seismic damage; simplified FE model; supertall buildings; tubed mega frame structure,ABAQUS; Axial loads; Damage detection; Earthquakes; Seismic design; Structural analysis; Structural frames; Tubes (components); Axial load ratio; High seismic intensities; Incremental dynamic analysis; Mega-frame structures; Seismic damage assessment; Simplified FE model; Structural systems; Super-tall buildings; Finite element method,0,0
13321,"Recent social developments and economic transformation have changed the engineering design approach from building design level towards community design level (city, region, country). The latter approach involves modeling of interconnections between different systems (buildings, transportation, water network, etc.) rather than designing the buildings individually. Thus, new analysis tools are expected to be developed to simulate the complex response of a community subsequently to disasters. The need of such rational tools is the object of this research work. Two different numerical approaches to simulate the response of a largescale built environment after a seismic scenario are explored by developing multipurpose numerical codes. A district of a virtual city is considered as a case study and the level of damage for built environment is estimated.

After the event, extensive field investigations were conducted to assess the seismic damages to the cultural heritage buildings in the Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhaktapur Durbar Squares. Major damages included failure of structural and non-structural components, tilting and collapse. Masonry-timber structures and masonry structures, the two structural types for the investigated heritage buildings, are analyzed separately in terms of the damage patterns. Damage classification criteria are proposed for the two structural types. Based on the criteria, a total of 68 structures investigated (52 masonry-timber and 16 masonry structures) are classified into four damage grades. The results show that only 30.8% of the masonry-timber structures and 18.8% of the masonry structures exhibited negligible to slight damage; the rest suffered more severe damage or even collapse.

The combination coefficient of the modified damage model is derived using the related experimental results of SRC columns. Then, a formula is developed to describe the relationship between the coefficient and the parameters of the SRC columns such as the axial load ratio, steel ratio and slenderness radio. The results indicate that at the failure state of the SRC members, the modified damage index has a mean value close to 1.0 and limited scatter. The damage response of SRC members can be better represented by the modified damage model.

13324,"The paper presents an extended seismic damage assessment of unanchored nonstructural components by means of rigid block analysis. Both (real) ground and floor motions are considered as loading histories, together with accelerogram inputs developed according to the latest protocols for shake table testing of (acceleration-sensitive) nonstructural components (AC156 and FEMA 461). A performance-based methodology is developed for the damage analysis of the components, also taking into account magnification and filtering actions of reinforced concrete buildings. Fragility curves are evaluated, and the influence of the key parameters on the seismic performance of rocking components is characterized. Floor motions are found to be more severe than (strong) ground motions, except for large blocks under moderate to overturning rocking amplitude (considering ground acceleration-based intensity measures). Strong floor motions are significantly more severe than (strong) ground motions, and they are associated with a relatively reduced record-to-record uncertainty. AC156 protocol produces inputs overall compatible with floor motions, whereas FEMA 461 protocol inputs are more severe and fit better strong floor motions. The severity of the record sets is found to be correlated with the frequency content of the loading histories.

13325,"In India, the 2001 Bhuj earthquake has given a serious warning to many existing reinforced concrete (RC) buildings. However, a considerable portion of the building stock of India is reinforced concrete buildings which are generally designed mainly for gravity loads only. Therefore, potential seismic evaluation of these buildings, especially in high seismic region, is very essential in order to implement any kind of seismic hazard mitigation strategy. Hence, the present study aims to evaluate the seismic vulnerability of low rise RC frame building which is designed for gravity load according to the Indian code. The non-linear static analysis is performed using SAP2000 (v16) to find the capacity curve of the building. Fragility analysis is used to develop the fragility curve for different damage grade based on HAZUS methodology. Damage probability matrices (DPM) are formed for two different seismic hazard levels i.e. for maximum considered earthquake and design basis earthquake depending on the performance point to compare the damage state for each hazard level.

13326,"Seismotectonic features of northeast India signify a very high probabilit of occurrence of major earthquake in future. However, a considerable portion of the building stock of this region is unreinforced masonry buildings. These buildings possess very little displacement capacity and consequently a devastating effect maybe observed during a future earthquake. Therefore, potential seismic evaluation of unreinforced masonry buildings in these areas is very essential in order to implement any kind of seismic hazard mitigation strategy. In this study, seismic evaluation of representative masonry building models is carried out by performing pushover analysis using available computer program SAP2000. In this method the masonry walls are modeled as equivalent frame made of vertical (pier) and horizontal (spandrels) elements with rigid intersecting joint elements and lumped plastic hinge concept. The model simulates nonlinear in-plane behaviour of the wall panels. The shear failure of spandrel is addressed by shear hinge at the middle and acombined failure of pier is addressed by two P-M interaction hinges at either end of the pier. However, combined failure is governed by the minimum failure envelopeof P-M interaction curves to ensure the effect of vertical load on the failure of pier. Lastly, fragility curves which express the expected damage as a function of spectraldisplacement were developed based on the capacity curve. © Springer India 2015.",Seismic damage evaluation of unreinforced masonry buildings in high seismic zone using the nonlinear static method,2015,None,Buildings; Concrete buildings; Earthquakes; Geophysics; Masonry construction; Masonry materials; Piers; Seismology; Walls (structural partitions); Devastating effects; Displacement capacity; Interaction curve; Nonlinear static methods; Push-over analysis; Seismic damage evaluation; Seismic evaluation; Unreinforced masonry building; Structural analysis,0,0
13327,"This paper reviews the existing studies related to seismic demand and experimental investigation of the nonstructural building curtain wall (CW). Being treated as a nonstructural component, seismic performance of the building CW relates to its seismic demand parameters, i.e., acceleration and drift demands. In current code provisions, the acceleration demand consists of the floor acceleration amplification factor, component acceleration amplification factor, component importance factor, and component response modification factor, which are all based on or induced by the floor response and dynamic response of the CW itself. For the CW which is attached to the main structure, drift demand is an indication of the interstory drift ratio. The in-plane seismic drift mechanism of the framed glass CW was fully developed, and the corresponding static testing protocols were implemented in codes based on several past experimental studies. Shaking table testing of the CW was conducted as well, where the input motions need specific floor response analysis of the main structure. The relevant damage state definition and fragility curve development are important to represent the performance and damage level of the CW system. The philosophy of the performance-based earthquake engineering (PBEE) and its application to CW are elaborated, and possible challenges related to the seismic demand, experimental studies, and PBEE of the CW are addressed as well. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Seismic demand and experimental evaluation of the nonstructural building curtain wall: A review,2017,Acceleration demand; Curtain wall; Drift demand; Fragility; Seismic performance; Shaking table; Testing protocol,Acceleration; Dynamic response; Floors; Seismic design; Seismic waves; Seismology; Curtain walls; Drift demands; Fragility; Seismic Performance; Shaking tables; Testing protocols; Walls (structural partitions); amplification; building; building code; dynamic response; experimental study; floor; seismic design; seismic response; shaking table test; wall,0,0
13328,"Probabilistic seismic risk is affected by several sources of uncertainty. Investigating their influence on loss analysis results is essential to obtain reliable quantitative estimations of seismic performance. Within the framework developed by the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research (PEER) Center for probabilistic seismic loss analysis, this study incorporates the effect of seismic demand model class uncertainty on seismic risk performance metric estimation. The extended formulation is illustrated with an application example code-designed reinforced concrete moment resisting frame building with unreinforced masonry (URM) infill walls, where model class uncertainty related to URM infill walls modeling is propagated to the estimation of seismic financial losses. Model class uncertainty accounts for the variability arising from the use of different modeling solutions, such as the ones associated with the adoption of three equivalent strut macro-models and their modeling parameters. Probabilistic distributions are assigned to selected infill strut model parameters, and a large set of finite element models (FEMs) are generated for each infill strut model class by sampling the model parameter distributions through Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). Expected values of repair cost and life-cycle annualized loss are evaluated and compared for two sets of three building performance models. The first set considers the original (median) values of infill strut backbone parameters, while the second set includes model parameter uncertainty. The uncertainty propagation from structural response results to repair costs is also reported for the six performance models.

13329,"Self-centering concentrically braced frame (SC-CBF) systems have been developed to increase the drift capacity of braced frame systems prior to damage. The SC-CBF has a column base detail that permits column uplift at a specified level of overturning moment resulting from lateral forces, softening the lateral force-lateral drift behavior of the system. Restoring forces from vertically-oriented posttensioning bars provides self-centering and reduces residual drift in the SC-CBF. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SC-CBF systems, a comparative study of seismic performance of SC-CBF systems with that of conventional CBF systems is performed using seismic fragility and engineering demand (e.g., peak inter-story drift and residual inter-story drift) hazard curves. First, two prototype buildings are designed with the same configuration, with either CBF or SC-CBF frames as the lateral-load-resisting system. Then both structures are analyzed using nonlinear time history finite element modeling under earthquake records that have various seismic characteristics. The seismic responses are then utilized to build accurate probabilistic demand models for peak inter-story drift and residual inter-story drift. Finally, fragility curves for three performance levels (immediate occupancy, life safety, and collapse prevention) and engineering demand hazard curves are generated using the developed probabilistic demand models. The comparison of the fragilities and engineering demand hazard curves of the two structural systems reveals that the SC-CBF system exhibits better seismic performance than the conventional CBF system. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Seismic demand models and performance evaluation of self-centering and conventional concentrically braced frames,2015,Engineering demand hazard; Inter-story and residual drifts prediction; Performance assessment; Seismic fragility; Self-centering system,Finite element method; Hazards; Seismic design; Seismic waves; Structural frames; Collapse prevention; Concentrically braced frames; Nonlinear time history; Performance assessment; Residual drifts; Seismic demand models; Seismic fragility; Self-centering system; Earthquakes; earthquake damage; earthquake engineering; multistorey building; performance assessment; probability; seismic design; seismic response; structural analysis; structural response,0,0
13330,"Motivated by the recent concept of seismic resilient structures and societies, the seismic resilient timber solutions were developed to provide the lateral drift capacity while reducing the structural damage through controlled rocking and self-centering motion. However, very limited studies have evaluated the seismic performance of the post-tensioned self-centering timber frame at the building level, restricting the real-world applications of such structure. This study provides a post-tensioned self-centering timber frame solution for a building hypothetically designed in a high seismic zone in China. Besides, the same architectural design is provided with another comparable structural solution, i.e., a typical post and beam frame system with timber braces, conforming to the design code requirements. Subsequently, the nonlinear numerical models are carefully developed and their crucial component behaviors are calibrated with the existing experimental results. Finally, the seismic performance of the two structural solutions are systematically evaluated. The peak inter-story drift, the residual inter-story drift, and the Park-Ang damage index at the system level are investigated. Moreover, the fragility curves are generated demonstrating the self-centering feature of the seismic resilient timber solution.

In this structural system, all beam-to-column and knee-element to beam and column connections are simple. This configuration creates a zonular rigid connection instead of concentrated rigid one in moment-resisting frame (MRF). It provides more flexibility in architectural design compared with laterally braced frames and reduces the costs and problems associated with the construction of rigid connections with complete-joint-penetration groove weld in MRFs. Moreover, KCF systems can be retrofitted with low cost, because the knee-elements can be easily repaired or replaced. In this study, two types of yield mechanisms (A and B) are introduced for the seismic design of the KCF system based on the capacity design concept. Then, its detailed seismic design procedure is developed based on mechanism A. For performance evaluation of the system according to FEMA P695 methodology, four sample KCF and special moment-resisting frames (SMRF) are designed and compared in terms of failure mechanism, collapse probability and seismic design parameters (Ω0, R and Cd). The results indicate that although the failure mechanism of KCF and SMRF is similar, collapse probability of KCF is less than SMRF. Moreover, the required ductility for both structural systems is provided properly. Consequently, KCF structural system can be classified in the category of MRFs, also seismic design parameters of SMRF can be used for KCF. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Seismic design and performance evaluation of steel frames with knee-element connections,2019,Capacity design; Collapse probability; Fragility curve; IDA analysis; Knee-element connection; Performance evaluation; Seismic design,Building materials; Failure (mechanical); Magnetorheological fluids; Probability; Seismology; Steel construction; Structural frames; Capacity design; Collapse probabilities; Fragility curves; IDA analysis; Knee-element connection; Performance evaluations; Seismic design,0,0
13332,"A seismic design procedure for CFS structures employing sheathed shear wall panels (SWP), compatible with the framework of the Eurocodes, is proposed in this paper. In order to assess the structural behaviour and generate the required data for the appraisal of the seismic design procedure, the OpenSees finite element environment was used to simulate the nonlinear behaviour of CFS-SWP adopting a novel deteriorating hysteresis model. Nonlinear static (pushover) and incremental dynamic analyses (IDA) have been carried out on 54 CFS-SWP frames having 2-, 4- and 5-storeys designed with varying seismic intensity levels. Fragility curves based on buildings collapse probability have been developed following the FEMA P695 methodology. Based on the defined design requirements, the CFS structural system evaluated in this study is shown to meet the acceptance criteria for a behaviour factor (q) equal to 2 for low- and moderate-seismicity. Furthermore, the results reveal that the lateral overstrength has a relevant influence on the probability of collapse and that an improved performance could be achieved if continuity of the CFS-SWP chord studs along the height is enforced. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Seismic design procedure for cold-formed steel sheathed shear wall frames: Proposal and evaluation,2017,Behaviour factor; CFSWSWP model; Cold-formed steel; FEMA P695; Seismic design; Seismic performance assessment,Design; Earthquake engineering; Finite element method; Hysteresis; Seismology; Shear walls; Structural analysis; Structural design; Studs (structural members); Walls (structural partitions); Behaviour factors; Cold-formed steel; Collapse probabilities; FEMA P695; Incremental dynamic analysis; Nonlinear behaviours; Seismic performance assessment; Structural behaviour; Seismic design,0,0
13333,"The main purpose of this study is to develop an estimation procedure of seismic design level setting for reinforced concrete (RC) piers considering aftershock-induced seismic hazards. This work develops an assessment method of the seismic hazards induced by aftershocks and takes an example of the Chi-Chi Earthquake in Taiwan. The number of aftershocks is assumed to follow the modified Gutenberg-Richter law with lower and upper bounds when analysing the cumulative density function of the magnitude of the aftershock within a specified post-mainshock period for the earthquake. Additionally, this work considers the spatial uncertainty in the hypocentres of aftershocks to assess the aftershock-induced seismic hazards. Fragility curves and residual factors of damaged RC piers are used in the transition probability matrix of Markov Chain model for considering the cumulative damage induced by aftershocks by incorporating uncertainty into aftershock events, as well as into structural capacity and residual factors corresponding to a specified damage state, the exceedance probabilities for various damage states can be estimated using Markov Chain model and Monte Carlo Simulation.

13334,"Seismic risk assessment at regional scales involves seismic hazard, inventory of assets at risk and respective vulnerability. Vulnerability refers to the susceptibility to earthquake impacts defined by the potential physical damages and resulting economic and social losses. Central to the vulnerability modelling is the concept of fragility function that correlates the expected structural damage to increasing levels of seismic intensity. Fragility functions combine a probabilistic seismic demand model and a probabilistic damage model. The probabilistic seismic demand model correlates a seismic intensity measure (IM) such as the spectral acceleration at the fundamental period of the building, Sa(Ti), to an engineering demand parameter (EDP) that better correlates with damage such as the maximum inter-story drift. The probabilistic damage model correlates the EDP to threshold damage states (e.g. slight, moderate, extensive, and complete). This paper presents the development of a new simplified probabilistic seismic demand model applicable for fragility analysis of ductile medium and high rise reinforced concrete moment resisting frame buildings (RC-MRF) for regional seismic risk studies. The model provides a direct correlation between the maximum inter-story drift to the Sa(Ti) using a new period dependent displacement coefficient. A database was compiled from literature sources of maximum inter-story drift seismic demand predictions using nonlinear finite element models for ductile RC-MRF that were subjected to increasing levels of ground motion intensities. The model was applied to develop fragility functions for a case study ductile 16-story high-rise RC-MRF building that conforms to the provisions of the 2005 National Building Code of Canada and estimate probable damage for 2% and 10% probability of exceedance in 50 years. © 2017Canadian Society for Civil Engineering.

13335,"Simulation of the cyclic response of a structurally deficient as-built reinforced concrete three-column bridge bent is conducted. The bent had deficient seismic details and was previously tested under cyclic loads in the field; damage included concrete crushing and longitudinal steel buckling at the column ends. A fiber-based bridge bent model is developed in OpenSees which includes soil-structure interaction (SSI) using simplified springs. The in-situ test of the as-built bent is used to validate the model. Subsequently, the damaged bent is conceptually repaired with a carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) enlarged column cross-section, denoted as CFRP donut, which includes a CFRP shell, headed steel bars, nonshrink concrete and a steel collar at the column bottom ends; CFRP composite jackets are employed above the CFRP donut to increase column shear and confinement. Design guidelines of the repair using a simplified strut-and-tie model (STM) are presented. A comparison of the as-built and repaired bridge bents under nonlinear static pushover analysis, incremental dynamic analysis (IDA), and fragility analysis using 22 far-field ground motions shows that the repair method is successful.

13336,"This paper investigates the seismic response of buildings equipped with Self-Centering Energy Dissipating (SCED) braces. Two-dimensional models of 3, 6, 12 and 16-story SCED buildings considering both material and geometric nonlinearities are investigated by carrying out pushover and nonlinear time-history analyses. The response indicators of the buildings are studied for weight-scaled ground motions to represent the Design Basis Earthquake (DBE) level and the Maximum Considered Earthquake (MCE) event. The fragility curves of the buildings for two Immediate Occupancy (IO) and Life Safety (LS) performance levels are developed using Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA). Results of the nonlinear response history analyses indicate that the maximum inter-story drift occurs at the taller buildings. The mean peak inter-story drift is less than 2% in both hazard levels. High floor acceleration peaks are observed in all the SCED frames regardless of the building height. The overall ductility and ductility demand increase when the number of stories reduces. The results also showed the residual displacement is negligible for all of case study buildings. The 3 and 6-story buildings exhibit desirable performance in IO and LS performance levels according to fragility curves results, while 12 and 16-story frames show poor performance especially in IO level. The results indicated the SCED braces performance is generally better in lower-rise buildings.

The objective is the optimization of structural responses of metaheuristic solutions. A regression model for the responses of the horizontal curved bridge with variable coefficients is built in the neural networks simulation environment based on the existing NTHA data. In order to achieve accurate results in a neural network, 1677 seismic analysis was performed in OpenSees. To achieve better performance of neural network and reduce the dimensionality of input data, dimensionality reduction techniques such as factor analysis approach were applied. Different types of neural network training algorithm were used and the best algorithm was adopted. The developed ANN approach is then used to verify the fragility curves of NTHA.

13338,"To analyze the seismic behavior of high-rise RC chimney, this paper selected one 240 high RC chimney as the research object. On the basis of distributed plastic fiber beam-column element, a detailed three-dimensional structural nonlinear analytical model is developed using the finite element software OpenSees. In order to consider the uncertainties in ground-motion realizations, according to the principle of spectral compatibility, 21 natural ground motion records are selected as the basis of incremental dynamic analysis. The peak ground acceleration and curvature ductility ratio have been selected as the intensity measure and structural seismic demand parameters, respectively. Based on lognormal assumptions, nonlinear incremental dynamic analysis is then performed for the case study RC chimney and statistically analyzed to build the probabilistic model of the seismic demand. According to concrete and longitudinal reinforcement strain levels, four damage limit states, named as the light, moderate, extensive and complete damage, were defined in terms of the analysis results of 95 sections. Then the fragility curves are developed for the RC chimney at various damage states and its vulnerability assessment and analysis are conducted. The study indicates that for frequent earthquake, basic earthquake and rare earthquake, the probabilities of exceeding the light damage state are around 0% , 20% and 75% , respectively; while the probabilities of exceedance corresponding to moderate, extensive and complete damage states are approximately zero.

13340,"The present study aims at the probabilistic seismic risk assessment of a base-isolated building frame under near- and far-field earthquakes by conducting a fragility analysis. For this purpose, a base-isolated 10-story reinforced concrete frame was considered having lead rubber bearing as the base isolation system. Fragility curves were developed for an ensemble of far-field and near-field (including directivity and fling-step effect) earthquakes, and for a number of damage measures, namely, maximum interstory drift ratio (MIDR), maximum base shear (MBS), maximum roof drift ratio (MRDR), maximum top floor acceleration (MTFA), and maximum isolator displacement (MID). Moreover, to investigate the effect of frequency contents of near-field earthquakes, the peak ground velocity (PGV) to peak ground acceleration (PGA) ratio of near-field directivity earthquakes was considered as a variable. Two sets of near-field directivity earthquakes were considered, one having a low PGV?PGA ratio, i.e., less than 150 (cm/s/g), and the other having a high PGV?PGA ratio, which is greater than 150 (cm/s/g). The incremental dynamic analysis was conducted to create the fragility curves by assuming different threshold values of damage states, namely, slight, moderate, extensive, and collapse. The results of the study indicate that even for the low PGA level, the near-field earthquakes cause a high probability of exceedance for the base-isolated frame. The PGV?PGA ratio has a significant effect on the damage probability for the near-field earthquakes because the high PGV?PGA ratio had greater damage probability compared to that of low PGV?PGA ratio. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Seismic Fragility Analysis of Base-Isolated Building Frames Excited by Near- and Far-Field Earthquakes,2019,Base isolation; Damage states; Fragility analysis; Incremental dynamic analysis; Lead rubber bearings; Near-field earthquakes,Bearings (structural); Damage detection; Nonmetallic bearings; Reinforced concrete; Risk assessment; Rubber; Shear flow; Base isolation; Damage state; Fragility analysis; Incremental dynamic analysis; Lead rubber bearing; Near-field earthquakes; Earthquakes,0,0

Accordingly, investigating the role of bracings in concrete structures along with the development of seismic fragility curves are of overriding concern to civil engineers. In this research, an ordinary RC building, designed according to the 1st edition of Iranian seismic code, was selected for examination. According to FEMA 356 code, this building is considered to be vulnerable. To improve the seismic performance of this building, 3 different types of bracings, which are Concentrically Braced Frames, Eccentrically Braced Frames and Buckling Restrained Frames were employed, and each bracing element was distributed in 3 different locations in the building.

Thus, the present paper investigated the effect of aftershocks on seismic responses of multispan reinforced concrete (RC) bridges using the fragility-based numerical approach. For that purpose, a continuous girder RC bridge class containing 8 bridges was selected based on the statistical analysis of the existing RC bridges in China. 75 recorded mainshock-aftershock seismic sequences from 10 well-known earthquakes were selected in this study. In order to account for the uncertainty of modeling parameters, uniform design method was applied as the sampling method for generating the samples for fragility analysis. Fragility curves were then developed using nonlinear time-history analysis in terms of the peak curvature of pier column and displacement of bearings. Finally, the system fragility curves were derived by implementing Monte Carlo simulation on multinormal distribution of two components. From the results of this investigation, it was found that, for the RC continuous bridges, the influence of aftershocks can be harmful to both bridge components and system, which increases both the component fragility of the displacement of bearings and seismic curvature of pier sections and system fragility.",Seismic Fragility Analysis of Multispan Reinforced Concrete Bridges Using Mainshock-Aftershock Sequences,2018,None,PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; DAMAGE; METHODOLOGY; BUILDINGS; COLUMNS; DEMAND,0,0
13349,"This study strives to highlight the importance of considering the vertical ground motions (VGM) in the seismic evaluation of RC buildings. To this aim, IDA (Incremental Dynamic Analysis) is conducted on three code-based designed high-rise RC frame-core wall buildings using a suite of earthquake records comprising of significant VGMs. To unravel the significance of the VGM inclusion on the performance of the buildings, IDAs are conducted in two states (with and without the vertical component), and subsequently based on each analysis, fragility curves are developed. Non-simulated collapse criteria are used to determine the collapse state drift ratio and the area under the velocity spectrum (SIm) is taken into account as the intensity measure. The outcome of this study delineates that the inclusion of VGM leads to the increase in the collapse vulnerability of the structures as well as to the change in the pattern of inter-story drifts and failure mode of the buildings.

Different intensity measures (IMs) for seismic fragility assessment of sliding artifacts are compared. The fragility curves of the sliding artifacts in both freestanding and restrained showcases placed on different floors of a four-story reinforced concrete frame structure are developed. The seismic sliding fragility of the artifacts within a real-world museum subjected to bi-directional horizontal ground motions is also assessed using the proposed IM and engineering demand parameter. Results show that the peak floor acceleration including only values initiating sliding is an efficient IM. Moreover, the sliding fragility estimate for the artifact in the restrained showcase increases as the floor level goes higher, while it may not be true in the freestanding showcase.

The secondary development of the sub-unit of the cam-type response amplification device was carried out by using ABAQUS finite element software, and then the dynamic time history analysis was performed on the prefabricated concrete structures.

13354,"Transmission towers are critical components of electrical transmission systems, whose damage and failure during earthquakes may cause extensive economic losses and significantly hinder the post-seismic rehabilitation. Seismic fragility analyses of pile-supported transmission towers are usually performed without regard for the influences of soil-structure interaction (SSI) and the site amplification of ground motions from the pile end to ground surface, which may lead to inaccurate structural performance evaluation results. In this context, the present study numerically investigates the seismic fragility of a typical pile-supported transmission tower considering SSI and depth-varying ground motion (DVGM) inputs. Specifically, a three-dimensional finite element model of the transmission tower is created in ABAQUS software, and SSI is simulated by adopting soil springs at the end of pile nodes. The three-dimensional DVGMs are stochastically synthesized to be used as seismic inputs. Moreover, the pushover analysis is employed to identify the threshold values of different limit states of the transmission tower. Then, probabilistic seismic demand models (PSDMs) are developed by nonlinear time history analyses and linear regression fitting, which are used to generate fragility curves. Furthermore, parameter studies are carried out to discuss the effects of SSI, DVGMs and structural parameter uncertainties on the seismic fragilities. Numerical results show that the seismic fragilities of the transmission tower can be affected substantially by the above mentioned three influencing factors.

13358,"In China, a considerable proportion of reinforced concrete (RC) industrial chimneys in operation was designed and constructed in accordance with less rigorous outdated seismic criteria during the end of 19th and early 20th century. However, few research works have been reported till date on a realistic overall assessment of the seismic performance of these existing aging RC chimney structures. Therefore, in this study, fragilities of existing RC chimney were studied. For this purpose, an existing 240m tall RC chimney was selected and structurally modeled with a lumped mass beam (stick) model by means of the OpenSees analysis program. In order to capture the uncertainties in ground motion realizations, a series of 21 ground motions are selected from the Next Generation Attenuation database as the input motions. To develop the analytical fragility curves, nonlinear incremental dynamic analysis of the studied RC chimney was then carried out using the selected input motions, which were normalized to different excitation levels. The section curvature ductility ratio was considered as the damage index. Based on material strain and sectional analysis, four limit states (LSs) were defined for five damage state. The seismic responses of the all sections were utilized to evaluate the likelihood of exceeding the LSs. Then the peak ground acceleration (PGA)-based seismic fragility curves of the structure were constructed assuming a lognormal distribution. Finally, under the light of these fragility curves, the damage risks in existing RC chimney were discussed. The analytical results indicated that for design level earthquake of PGA=0.1g (g is the gravitational acceleration) and the maximum considered earthquake of PGA=0.22g, the probabilities of exceeding the light damage state were around 1.5% and 44%, respectively, while the exceedance probabilities corresponding to moderate, extensive and complete damage states were approximately zero in both cases. On the other hand, fragility analysis revealed that the RC chimney structure had considerable ductility capacity and was capable to withstand a strong earthquake with some structural damages.

13361,"An analytical seismic fragility assessment framework is presented for the existing low strength reinforced concrete structures more common in the building stock of the developing countries. For realistic modelling of such substandard structures, low strength concrete stress-strain and bond-slip capacity models are included in calibrating material models. Key capacity parameters are generated stochastically to produce building population and cyclic pushover analysis is carried out to capture inelastic behaviour. Secant period values are evaluated corresponding to each displacement step on the capacity curves and used as seismic demand. A modified capacity demand diagram method is adopted for the degrading structures, which is further used to evaluate peak ground acceleration from back analysis considering each point on the capacity curve as performance point. For developing fragility curves, the mean values of peak ground acceleration are evaluated corresponding to each performance point on the series of capacity curves.

13362,"Seismic fragility curves are recognized as a useful tool for seismic performance assessment of pile-supported wharf structure (PSWS) exposed to seismic hazards. These curves quantify the probability of structural vulnerability against given ground motion parameters. Soil-pile interaction (SPI) is found to have a significant impact on seismic performance of pile-supported structures. In this study, in order to better understand the SPI effect, the seismic fragility of a large-scale PSWS located at the Port of Los Angeles Berth 100, USA, is fully investigated with and without considering SPI. Herein, the pushover analysis scheme is used for inferring the bound limits of seismic demands of this large-scale PSWS. Specifically, the purpose of pushover analysis is twofold: to identify which pile of the PSWS most likely suffers from seismic failure; and to determine the bound limits of seismic demands for estimation of fragility curves using the identified pile. A collection of ground motions with low and high moment magnitudes as well as small and large fault distances are selected for nonlinear time history analysis. The seismic demand models can be readily estimated from the data set of the intensity measure-seismic demand pairs by classical regression fitting. A comparison of fragility curves with and without SPI shows that SPI significantly influences the seismic fragility of the PSWS. For distinct damage states, the effect of SPI on the seismic fragilities of different piles can be totally different.",Seismic fragility assessment of large-scale pile-supported wharf structures considering soil-pile interaction,2019,Pile-supported wharf structure; Fragility; Soil-pile interaction; Pushover analysis; Nonlinear time history analysis,PERFORMANCE; BRIDGES; BUILDINGS; DISPLACEMENT; RESILIENCE; RISK,0,0

13364,"The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is located near an active seismic zone; the Zagros folded belt and the Makran subduction zone in Iran. The Mb5 earthquake on 11 March 2002 in Masafi in the UAE highlighted the potential risk posed by local seismic sources. However, the seismic hazard is generally considered to be low to moderate in the UAE, depending on the proximity to the seismic sources. The objective of this study was to assess the fragility of buildings in Sharjah City when subjected to the probable seismic hazard. Sharjah City was divided into areas, and the buildings and the population data were collected for each area. The buildings were then classified according to their usage, heights and structural systems. The buildings were classified and model representative buildings were assigned for each of the different areas in Sharjah. Seismic fragility analysis was performed for each representative building to assess its performance under the probable seismic hazard using time history analysis and the fragility curves were prepared for each building type. The results of the study showed that the buildings that were not designed for earthquake resistance were most venerable. Finally, probable losses were estimated using available loss functions and a GIS database was developed for the city. © 2018 Esprit.

13365,"After learning from several devastating earthquakes in China in recent years, stricter design criteria have been introduced in the current Chinese seismic design code. To investigate the reliability of the current seismic design code, seismic fragility analyses were performed for 45 10-story reinforced concrete (RC) frame-shear wall structures designed according to the current Chinese seismic design code by analytical methods, considering the uncertainty of earthquake ground motions. The plastic rotation at the ends of the structural component (or the total chord rotation) and the maximum inter-story drift were employed as damage identifiers to quantify the four performance levels, i.e., fully operational, operational, repairable and collapse prevention. Thus, seismic fragility curves corresponding to individual performance levels were developed on the basis of nonlinear time history analyses for the reference RC frame-shear wall structure. The influences of the site soil type, the seismic protection intensity and the performance index on the fragility curves were analyzed. The structural reliability of RC frame-shear wall structures was examined using the developed fragility curves. The results indicate that the seismic performance objectives of RC frame-shear wall structures designed according to the current Chinese seismic design code can be achieved with good reliability.",Seismic Fragility Assessment of RC Frame-Shear Wall Structures Designed According to the Current Chinese Seismic Design Code,2015,RC frame-shear wall structure; seismic fragility; performance-based seismic design,CONCRETE; BUILDINGS; DAMAGE; MODEL,0,0
13367,"Fragility curves represent the probabilities that structural damages, under various levels of seismic excitation, will exceed the specified damage states by means of earthquake intensity damage relations. Conceptual aspects related to seismic vulnerability, damage and risk evaluation are discussed first, together with a short review of the most widely used possibilities for the seismic evaluation of structures. The capacity spectrum method starting from capacity and fragility curves is then discussed. The determination of capacity curves for buildings using a non-linear structural analysis tools is then explained, together with a simplified expeditious procedure allowing the development of fragility curves. Next, the seismic risk of the special truss moment frame (STMF) systems of Tehran, the capital of Iran, is analysed in this paper using the capacity spectrum method. The seismic hazard of the studied area is described by using the reduced 5%-damped elastic response spectra. Significant damage is obtained for mid-rise and high-rise special truss moment frames with a Vierendeel middle panel, because of the buckling and early fracture of truss web members.

13369,"The 2001 7.6 earthquake which struck the Kutch region in the western part of India was one of the largest intraplate earthquakes to have struck the Indian subcontinent. There was extensive destruction of unreinforced brick masonry (URM) buildings in the region. Assessing the vulnerability of the masonry structures of this region is complicated due to a lack of accelerograms and realistic models for the cyclic response of masonry. In this paper, synthetic accelerograms for the region are generated using the modified stochastic finite-fault method. The monotonic backbone curve is developed using a mechanics-based approach. Stress-based criteria are used to identify the displacement limit states. Experimental data of two URM shear walls are used to calibrate hysteretic models for performing nonlinear time-history analyses. Damage predictions show good comparison with the earthquake reconnaissance reports on URM damage. Seismic fragility curves indicate the high vulnerability of URM structures under the expected range of seismic intensities for the region. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Seismic Fragility Assessment of Unreinforced Masonry Shear Walls,2020,Fragility; Nonlinear time-history analyses; Peak ground acceleration; Peak ground velocity; Seismic assessment; Unreinforced masonry,Earthquakes; Graphic methods; Random processes; Shear walls; Stochastic systems; Damage prediction; Earthquake reconnaissance; Indian subcontinents; Intraplate earthquakes; Masonry structures; Nonlinear time history analysis; Seismic fragility curves; Unreinforced masonry; Masonry materials,0,0
13371,"A steel frame with a semi-rigid connection is one of the most widely used structural systems in modern construction. These systems are cheap to make, require less time to construct and offer the highest quality and reliable construction quality without the need for highly skilled workers. However, these systems show greater natural periods compared to their perfectly rigid frame counterparts. This causes the building to attract low loads during earthquakes. In this research study, the seismic performance of steel frames with semi-rigid joints is evaluated. Three connections with capacities of 50, 70 and 100% of the beam’s plastic moment are studied and examined. The seismic performance of these frames is determined by a non-linear static pushover analysis and an incremental dynamic analysis leading finally to the fragility curves which are developed. The results show that a decrease in the connection capacity increases the probability of reaching or exceeding a particular damage limit state in the frames is found. © 2021 by the authors.

13374,"The seismic events in Northern Italy, May 2012, have revealed the seismic vulnerability of typical Italian precast industrial buildings. The aim of this paper is to present a seismic fragility model for Italian RC precast buildings, to be used in earthquake loss estimation and seismic risk assessment by comparing two building typologies and three different codes: D.M. 303-1975, D.M. 16-01-1996 and current Italian building code that has been released in 2008. Based on geometric characteristics and design procedure applied, ten different building classes were identified. A Monte Carlo simulation was performed for each building class in order to generate the building stock used for the development of fragility curves trough analytical method. The probabilistic distributions of geometry were mainly obtained from data collected from 650 field surveys, while the material properties were deduced from the code in place at the time of construction or from expert opinion. The structures were modelled in 2D frameworks; since the past seismic events have identified the beam-column connection as the weakest element of precast buildings, two different modelling solutions were adopted to develop fragility curves: a simple model with post processing required to detect connection collapse and an innovative modelling solution able to reproduce the real behaviour of the connection during the analysis.

13378,"Cross-laminated timber (CLT) has been gaining popularity also in seismic regions, because of its low carbon footprint and potential cost-competitiveness with concrete and steel construction. Recent effort has focused on developing standardized design provisions for CLT buildings. In the study presented herein, incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) was performed on a six-story CLT platform-type building. A nonlinear numerical model was developed in OpenSees considering the CLT shear walls as elastic shell elements and the connections (wall-to-foundation, wall-to-floor, and wall-to-wall) as nonlinear springs. The hysteresis behavior of the connections was modeled using ""pinching4""after calibrating its parameters against experimental results, and the load-deformation response of the shear walls was validated against full-scale test results. The building's seismic performance - terms of interstory drift until collapse - was evaluated using fragility curves constructed from the IDA. The probability of collapse was less than 0.1% at the maximum considered earthquake, and the resulting collapse margin ratio demonstrated that a six-story CLT platform-type building can safely be built in a high seismic zone if appropriately designed. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Seismic Fragility Estimates for Cross-Laminated Timber Platform Building,2020,Finite element analyses; Incremental dynamic analysis; Mass-timber construction,Carbon footprint; Earthquakes; Laminating; Low carbon steel; Shear walls; Timber; Cost competitiveness; Hysteresis behavior; Incremental dynamic analysis; Load-deformation response; Maximum considered earthquakes; Non-linear numerical model; Non-linear springs; Seismic Performance; Structural design,0,0
13379,"This paper focuses on seismic fragility assessment of high-rise building with a traditional Tuned Mass Damper (TMD) and an Actuated Tuned Mass Damper (ATMD) system. An adaptive damping system has been proposed and evaluated to create a “smart” system for existing and new buildings. This technology can help reduce the response of a building during earthquakes. In this study, an 8-story steel building is selected as a case study structure, and analyzed to evaluate seismic performance during seismic activities. The TMD and ATMD systems are applied to reduce excitation response of the structure due to earthquakes. Time history analyses using multiple ground motions are performed to identify dynamic characteristics of the case study building. Drift-sensitive limit states are used to develop fragility curves for building performance. Then, seismic fragility curves that provide a probabilistic measure of the vulnerability of high-rise buildings using demand models for multiple limit states are developed. The preliminary results of fragility estimate show that the controlled buildings with TMD and ATMD reduce seismic vulnerability.

13380,"In the present study, a methodology for developing fragilities of arch concrete dams to assess their performance against seismic hazards is introduced. Firstly, the probability risk and fragility curves are presented, followed by implementation and representation of the way this method is used. Amirkabir arch concrete dam was subjected to non-linear dynamic analyses. A modified three dimensional rotating smeared crack model was used to take the nonlinear behavior of mass concrete into account. The proposed model considers major characteristics of mass concrete. These characteristics are pre-softening behavior, softening initiation criteria, fracture energy conservation, suitable damping mechanism and strain rate effect. In the present analysis, complete fluid-structure interaction is included to account for appropriate fluid compressibility and absorptive reservoir boundary conditions. In this study, the Amirkabir arch concrete dam is subjected to a set of 8 three-component earthquakes each scaled to 10 increasing intensity levels. Using proposed nonlinear smeared crack model, nonlinear analysis is performed where the structure is subjected to a large set of scaled and un-scaled ground motions and the maximum responses are extracted for each one and plotted. Based on the results, fragility curves were plotted according to various and possible damages indexes. Discrete damage probabilities were calculated using statistical methods for each considered performance level and incremental nonlinear analysis. Then, fragility curves were constructed based on the lognormal distribution assumption. Two damage indexes were introduced and compared to one another. The results indicate that the dam has a proper stability under earthquake conditions at MCE level. Moreover, displacement damages index is more conservative and impractical in the fragility analysis than tensional damage index.",Seismic fragility evaluation of arch concrete dams through nonlinear incremental analysis using smeared crack model,2018,seismic fragility analysis; arch concrete dam; non-linear analysis; smeared crack model,DAMAGE MODEL; GRAVITY DAMS; CURVES; BUILDINGS; FRACTURE,0,0
13381,"The studies on the seismic fragility evaluation of semi-rigid (SR) steel moment frames are meager in the existing literature. The purpose of the present numerical study is to investigate the seismic fragility of SR frames subjected to near-field earthquakes. Specific characteristics of the fragility curves for near-field earthquakes are highlighted by comparing them with those for far-field earthquakes. A ten-story SR frame is analyzed subjected to four sets of earthquakes considering the moderate degree of semi-rigidity. The four sets of earthquakes, namely, far-field, near-field with high directivity, low directivity, and fling-step consist of ensembles of ten real ground motion records in each ensemble. The fragility plots are developed by considering a number of damage measures, namely, the maximum inter-story drift ratio, maximum base shear, maximum roof drift angle, maximum top-story acceleration with the peak ground acceleration (PGA) as an intensity measure. Threshold values for different damage states are decided based on the engineering judgment. For the near-field earthquake with directivity effect, the frequency repercussions on the fragility curves are investigated by varying the peak ground velocity (PGV) to PGA ratio with high (> 160 cm/s-g), and low (< 160 cm/s-g) ratios. The major findings of the numerical study show that a high directivity ratio of the near-field earthquake has a significant effect on the probability of exceedance as compared to the far-field earthquake.

Seismic risk assessment of such facility has a great role on making required decisions for management of risk such as retrofit, etc. This research aims to investigate the seismic vulnerability of each element of a unit of a refinery and their impact on the overall vulnerability of the unit. To this end, seismic risk assessment of equipment and support building as a section of a refinery is under study. In order to analyse seismic behaviour of the non-structural components, equipment have been assumed as block-type. Failure modes are selected based on damages caused by past earthquakes. Shear failure of bolts have been considered as failure mode of equipment. Peak ground acceleration is chosen as earthquake intensity measure. In order to develop seismic fragility curves, created models are subjected to sixty ground motion records, each scaled to multiple levels of intensity to perform incremental dynamic analysis using MATLAB software.

13387,"Flexible pipelines are often used to connect hard pipes from a foundation to a superstructure to accommodate large deformation in the base isolation layer during an earthquake. Although Chinese seismic design guidelines suggest several configurations, they are different from the designs that have been proven in practice, e.g., Japanese styles, and extensive experimental investigation into their seismic performance is required. Three types of seals, rubber-, metal- and asbestine-based, were tested quasi-statically with infilled pressurized water at 2.5 MPa. The asbestine-based seal leaked at a smaller deformation than the other two types of seals. Based on the test results, three damage states were defined and the deformation capacity was estimated. To evaluate their performance, a three-dimensional model of a base-isolated medical building was developed using OpenSees, with the flexible pipelines simulated by a mechanical model calibrated from the experimental data.

13390,"Past earthquake episodes of moderate-to-high magnitude have shown that strong mainshock trigger usually strong aftershocks forming, in such a way, the so-called mainshock-aftershock (MSAS) sequences. The latter can normally induce higher seismic losses to structures and infrastructures compared to the single mainshock event. High vulnerability has been also detected for structural systems being subjected to the soft soil earthquake strong ground motions due to the soft soils-driven amplification in structural demand. Along these lines, this study investigates the seismic fragility of an existing reinforced concrete (rc) structure subjected to MSAS sequences recorded on soft soil profiles. To this end, a preliminary selection of 28 and 52 soft-soil mainshocks and aftershocks strong GMs respectively served the basis to generate 36 artificial earthquake sequences. The latter were made of six mainshocks and six aftershocks seismic motions that are representative of the initially formed sets of records in terms of the predominant period, Tg, and the strong ground motion duration. An existing seven-story rc building located in Van Nuys, California, was modelled by using the OpenSees finite element code. The measured response of the building during the Northridge (1994) earthquake episode was used to validate the finite element model developed herein. Nonlinear time history analysis was performed and the soft-soil MSAS-induced structural response (i.e., roof drift, maximum interstory drift ratio and maximum residual interstory drift ratio) was comparatively assessed with the response induced by MSAS sequences recorded on firm soil conditions. Fragility analysis was also conducted and the relevant fragility curves were estimated accounting for varying intensity of the aftershocks. Based on the results derived herein, the firm-soil MSAS led to higher structural collapse capacity compared to the one that was calculated by using the soft-soil MSAS, the latter being more profound when the building was subjected to aftershocks with increased intensity. © 2019 The authors.",Seismic fragility of RC structures under mainshockaftershock sequences recorded on soft soil conditions,2019,Drift Demand; Earthquake Sequences; Fragility Curves; Nonlinear Response History Analysis; Reinforced Concrete Structure; Soft Soil Conditions; Strong Ground Motions,Computational methods; Concrete buildings; Earthquake effects; Engineering geology; Finite element method; Reinforced concrete; Seismic response; Soils; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Drift demands; Earthquake sequences; Fragility curves; Nonlinear response history analysis; Soft soils; Strong ground motion; Earthquake engineering,0,0
13392,"Special truss moment frames (STMFs) are used as the lateral force-resisting systems in buildings. Under seismic loading, the hysteretic energy dissipation in STMFs mostly occurs through the flexural plastic hinges developed in the special segments only. This study presents the seismic fragility assessment of low to high-rise STMFs with ductile Vierendeel panels as the special segments. Four building frames (i.e., 3-, 6-, 9-, and 15-story) with three different configurations of special segments in STMFs have been considered as the study frames. Nonlinear incremental dynamic analyses of the study frames have been carried out using computer software PERFORM-3D using forty-four ground motion records. The probability of exceeding the drift levels corresponding to three performance levels, viz., immediate occupancy (IO), life safety (LS), and collapse prevention (CP) of the study frames have been investigated under the design-basis earthquake and maximum considered earthquake hazard levels. The presence of intermediate vertical members in the Vierendeel panels resulted in the gradual loss in the post-peak lateral strengths of STMFs. The use of multiple Vierendeel panels significantly reduced the probability of failure of low-rise (namely, 3- and 6-story) STMFs. However, STMFs with single Vierendeel panels are found to be beneficial in 9- and 15-story building frames.

13393,"Introduction: In recent years, the seismic vulnerability of structures in Malaysia has attracted the attention of researchers mainly because the majority of existing structures have not been designed for seismic actions. In this study, seismic vulnerability of tall concrete wall buildings has been investigated through the development of seismic fragility curves. Methods: Two 25-story tall buildings with similar plans but with the different number of parking levels were analyzed through the incremental dynamic analysis. The tall buildings were excited by 15 far-field earthquakes, and their inter-story drift demands and capacities were estimated. Nonlinear response of beams and columns was simulated through the lumped plasticity model. The inelastic response of concrete walls was taken into account through the use of distributed plasticity fibre-based elements. Results and Conclusion: The obtained results indicated that the probability of exceeding minor damage to the tall concrete wall buildings located in the Kuala Lumpur city was around 55%.

13394,"Earthquake-induced loss of buildings is a fundamental concern for earthquake-resilient cities. The FEMA P-58 method is a state-of-the-art seismic loss assessment method for buildings. Nevertheless, because the FEMA P-58 method is a refined component-level loss assessment method, it requires highly detailed data as the input. Consequently, the knowledge of building details will affect the seismic loss assessment. In this study, a seismic loss assessment method for buildings combining building information modeling (BIM) with the FEMA P-58 method is proposed. The detailed building data are automatically obtained from the building information model in which the building components may have different levels of development (LODs). The determination of component type and the development of the component vulnerability function when the information is incomplete are proposed. The modeling rules and the information extraction from BIM through the Autodesk Revit application programming interface (API) are also proposed. Finally, to demonstrate the rationality of the proposed method, an office building that is available online is selected, and the seismic loss assessments with various-LOD BIM data are performed as case studies. The results show that, on the one hand, even if the available building information is limited, the proposed method can still produce an acceptable loss assessment; on the other hand, given more information, the accuracy of the assessment can be improved and the uncertainty can be reduced using the proposed method. Consequently, this study provides a useful reference for the automation of the refined seismic loss assessment of buildings.",Seismic loss assessment for buildings with various-LOD BIM data,2019,Building seismic loss; Building information modeling; FEMA P-58; Level of development; Vulnerability function,SUSTAINABILITY APPRAISAL; RESISTING SYSTEMS; FRAGILITY CURVES; STEEL BUILDINGS; EARTHQUAKE; DESIGN; FRAMES,0,0
13395,"One of the strongest earthquake in Romania was the Vrancea earthquake on 10 November 1940, with moment magnitude 7.7 and depth of 150 km. This event caused significant losses over a wide territory, up to Iasi and Craiova cities. The number of casualties in Romania was around 593 dead and 1271 injured and 65,000 homes were destroyed. A major questions nowadays is: What could the consequences of a similar earthquake be?. Through this paper we try to provide insights, by relying on the newly implemented System for Estimating the Seismic Damage in Romania (SeisDaRo), operated by National Institute for Earth Physics (NIEP). This system uses the Improved-Displacement Capacity Analytical Method implemented in the SELENA Software for expressing building loss probabilities. The building database (at city or commune level) is classified into 48 types (depending on construction material, height and age), each with a specific capacity and fragility curve. For this paper we also compute casualty estimates. In the absence of real seismic recordings from the 1940 earthquake we obtained hazard parameters through different ground motion prediction equations (developed by Sokolov, Marmureanu or Vacareanu) specific for the Vrancea intermediate-depth source. Also we test the possibility of using data converted from intensity to acceleration. The damage estimates are represented on relevant maps.

13396,"The reuse of historical centers requires to solve in a reliable manner the problem of seismic analysis of the residential units belonging to building clusters. This implies complex interactions at the structural level, which influence the seismic response and damage mechanisms of the individual units. Even if a rigorous approach would require the analysis of the entire aggregate, in the professional practice, the safety assessment is typically performed on the single unit [1]. At the regional scale, empirical methodologies aimed at taking into account the variation of the vulnerability according to the position of the unit within the aggregate and some geometrical features were developed. In the case studies here presented, a computational modelling in the non-linear dynamic field is performed, which allows to calibrate the fragility curves for the building aggregate. The case studies are two large building clusters located in Puglia (in the historical centers of Foggia and Sant'Agata di Puglia [2]). Preliminary FEM simulations under seismic actions provided information about the overall response in terms of vibration and deformation modes, allowing to select the most significant ones. Then, it was possible to define a simplified plane model, able to represent the transversal response, which revealed to be the predominant one. Moreover, some partial, simplified models were defined for limited architectural parts that are particularly representative regarding the development of mechanisms of damage and collapse [2]. These models, consisting of an assembly of quadrilateral elements, are formulated in accordance with a RBSM approach [3,4]. Non-linear dynamic analyses have shown that the vulnerability is very different from the one predicted by classical vulnerability methods, highlighting that in the case of complex cluster, a more detailed and specific tool for the vulnerability analysis is required.",Seismic modelling and analysis of masonry building in aggregate: A case study,2017,Building Aggregates; Masonry buildings; Non-linear Dynamics,Aggregates; Buildings; Computational methods; Dynamics; Engineering geology; Finite element method; Geophysics; Masonry construction; Masonry materials; Seismic response; Seismology; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Computational modelling; Geometrical features; Masonry building; Non-linear dynamic analysis; Non-linear dynamics; Professional practices; Quadrilateral elements; Vulnerability analysis; Earthquake engineering,0,0
13398,"Due to their aesthetics and structural advantages, diagrid structures have been used for several mid- to high-rise buildings around the world. However, their seismic performance, collapse fragility, and resilience are yet to be studied. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the nonlinear performance of steel diagrid structures using static, time-history dynamic, and incremental dynamic analyses. A framework for seismic performance assessment and loss estimation of steel diagrid buildings is developed. Illustrative and quantitative criteria for performance and damage assessment of diagrid frames are introduced and employed to estimate the seismic loss of archetype diagrid buildings. The diagrids are found to have a substantial collapse capacity and lateral stiffness. Nonetheless, the nonstructural loss due to large maximum absolute floor acceleration experienced by stiff diagrid frames may adversely impact the expected total loss. Due to the shear lag effect, the corner diagonal members are the key elements in their behavior. Further, the effects of building height, diagonal angle, and incomplete diagrid modules on performance and loss are studied. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Seismic Performance Assessment and Loss Estimation of Steel Diagrid Structures,2018,Collapse capacity; Diagrid; Loss estimation; Seismic performance,Damage detection; Earthquake engineering; Seismic waves; Shear flow; Tall buildings; Collapse capacities; Diagrid; Incremental dynamic analysis; Loss estimation; Quantitative criteria; Seismic Performance; Seismic performance assessment; Structural advantage; Seismology,0,0
13399,"The National Geological Museum is a representative building for the typology of historic unreinforced masonry structures built in Romania at the beginning of the XX century. The seismic behaviour was studied with respect to the displacement capacity, by comparing the initial structural configuration of the building with the retrofitted one. Taking into account the irregularities of the structure and the localized reinforced concrete jacketing works done in the 80s', global results were proven to be misleading. Thus, relative floor displacements were used to study the behaviour of individual walls involved in local failures. Limit state thresholds based on relative displacements were used in order to calibrate the initial model with the post-earthquake damage assessment and then they were compared to the results obtained for the retrofitted model to establish the effectiveness of the strengthening works. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Seismic performance assessment based on displacement capacity of unreinforced masonry structures,2021,None,Earthquake engineering; Reinforced concrete; Seismic response; Structures (built objects); Sustainable development; Displacement capacity; Earthquake damages; Reinforced concrete jacketing; Relative displacement; Seismic behaviour; Seismic performance assessment; Structural configurations; Unreinforced masonry structures; Damage detection,0,0
13400,"This study assesses the seismic performance of a hybrid coupled wall (HCW) system with replaceable steel coupling beams (RSCBs) at four intensities of ground motion shaking. The performance of the HCW system is benchmarked against the traditional reinforced concrete coupled wall (RCW). Nonlinear numerical models are developed in OpenSees for a representative wall elevation in a prototype 11-story building designed per modern Chinese codes. Performance is assessed via nonlinear dynamic analysis. The results indicate that both systems can adequately meet code defined objectives in terms of global and component behavior. Behavior of the two systems is consistent under service level earthquakes, whereas under more extreme events, the HCW system illustrates enhanced performance over the RCW system resulting in peak interstory drifts up to 31% lower in the HCW than the RCW. Larger drifts in the RCW are because of reduced coupling action induced by stiffness degradation of RC coupling beams, whereas the stable hysteretic responses and overstrength of RSCBs benefit post-yield behavior of the HCW. Under extreme events, the maximum beam rotations of the RSCBs are up to 42% smaller than those of the RC coupling beams. Moderate to severe damage is expected in the RC coupling beams, whereas the RSCBs sustain damage to the slab above the beam and possible web buckling of shear links. The assessment illustrates the benefits of the HCW with RSCBs over the RCW system, because of easy replacement of the shear links as opposed to costly and time-consuming repairs of RC coupling beams.

13401,"Pile-supported wharves may be subjected to severe damage during major earthquakes. As such, efficient strategies for retrofitting wharf systems are needed. In this study, we investigate the seismic performance of a pile-supported wharf retrofitted by the following three conventional slope strengthening strategies: i) improving the ground with a soil-cement mixture, ii) driving pin piles near dike toe, and iii) creating an underwater bulkhead system using sheet piles. Effectiveness of the three retrofit schemes is assessed comprehensively. First, seismic response of the as-built and retrofitted pile-supported wharf is investigated. Subsequently, performance of the retrofit strategies in mitigating the seismic vulnerability is thoroughly investigated by comparing component and system-level fragility curves. It was found that: (1) overall, the strategies are effective in mitigating the seismic response and in reducing the seismic fragilities of the wharf system; (2) the performance of the retrofit measures varies at the structural component level, as a retrofit measure may have an isolated local negative effect for a certain structural component. In this regard, an appropriate retrofit strategy should be identified based on specifically defined retrofit purposes; and (3) as implemented, the soil-cement mixture performed best (in lowering the system seismic fragility), followed by the pin pile, and lastly the sheet pile.",Seismic performance assessment of a pile-supported wharf retrofitted with different slope strengthening strategies,2020,Seismic performance; Pile-supported wharf; Retrofit; Slope improvement; Fragility analysis; Soil-pile interaction,FRAGILITY ANALYSIS; CYCLIC MOBILITY; NEAR-FAULT; BRIDGES; MODEL; METHODOLOGY; SENSITIVITY; BUILDINGS; CURVES,0,0
13402,"In the seismically active Indian Himalayan region, lack of available flat lands and ever-increasing housing needs have led to widespread construction of multi-storey reinforced concrete moment frame buildings on hilly slopes. Such buildings have foundation at different levels and columns of varying height to accommodate ground slope, introducing stiffness irregularity over the height of the structure. During an earthquake, this can lead to stress concentration in structure and may make them more vulnerable to collapse as compared to their regular counterparts. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the seismic performance and factors influencing collapse capacity of buildings on hilly slopes designed as per modern Indian seismic building codes, which is not extensively investigated in past. To this end, two-dimensional numerical building models capable of simulating flexural and shear failure are created in OpenSEES for modern Indian seismic code compliant reinforced concrete special moment resisting frames located in city of Aizwal in the Himalayan region of India. The collapse capacity of the nonlinear building models is evaluated using incremental dynamic analysis for a suite of site specific ground motions. The seismic collapse fragility curves are developed as a metric to assess the seismic vulnerability of buildings. Buildings located on slope have lower median collapse capacity as compared to buildings located on flat grounds. The seismic response of buildings located on slope is particularly influenced by type of configuration and building height. The median collapse capacity [Sa(T=1s)] decreases by 20% to 42% with increase in slope angle from 5ºto 30ºas compared to building on no slope. © 13th International Conference on Applications of Statistics and Probability in Civil Engineering, ICASP 2019.

13403,"This paper proposes a novel low-rise precast wall panel structure with bolt connections, which has advantages of convenient and rapid assembly. To investigate seismic performance of the structure system, a shaking table test of a 1/2 scaled three-story model is conducted, by which the structural dynamic responses, damage pattern, and seismic fragility are analyzed. The results show that the proposed novel precast structure system presents high stiffness, high load capacity and high collapse margin ratio. In this novel structure system, the bolt connections are critical for the structural dynamic characteristics and responses. Damage pattern of the structure follows the sequence of bolt loosening, adjoining wall panels sliding and dislocating, structural components cracking. The seismic damage of test structure is slight, and most structural components still remain elastic in maximum considered earthquakes. Based on the test results, performance design objectives for service level earthquake, design based earthquake and maximum considered earthquake are given, and four limit states are defined.

13404,"This study aims to assess seismic vulnerability of a typical pile-supported wharf considering ageing effects due to chloride-induced corrosion of the reinforced concrete piles. In order to improve the seismic performance of corroded wharves, carbon fibre-reinforced polymers is used as a retrofit technique. Three-dimensional model of the wharf is constructed using SAP2000, and pushover analysis is conducted to deduce the capacity curve of the wharf and establish quantitative criteria for bound of damage states. Then, using eight ground motion records, nonlinear static analysis called capacity spectrum method is used to evaluate the response of initial (t = 0 years), corroded (t = 25, 50, 75 years) and carbon fibre-reinforced polymer-retrofitted-corroded (t = 50, 50, 75 years) pile-supported wharf structures. In order to assess the seismic vulnerability of wharves quantitatively, fragility curves are developed using two different engineering demand parameters, including displacement ductility factor (μd) and state of plastic hinges. These fragility curves demonstrate the evolving damage potential under different levels of intensities taking into account time-dependent corrosion-induced deterioration. In addition, these curves reveal the effectiveness of carbon fibre-reinforced polymer method on the fragility reduction. Results indicate an increment in seismic vulnerability throughout the lifetime of the structure due to corrosion denoting the considerable impact of deterioration due to ageing effects on structural response. Moreover, using carbon fibre-reinforced polymer jacketing as a retrofit and repair method for corrosion-induced damaged structures can remarkably enhance their seismic performance. © The Author(s) 2016.",Seismic performance assessment of pile-supported wharves retrofitted by carbon fibre-reinforced polymer composite considering ageing effect,2016,Ageing effects; Capacity spectrum method; Carbon fibre-reinforced polymers; Fragility curves; Pile-supported wharf; Seismic vulnerability,Beams and girders; Bridge decks; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon fibers; Corrosion; Deterioration; Earthquake engineering; Fiber reinforced plastics; Fibers; Hydraulic structures; Polymers; Reinforced concrete; Reinforced plastics; Religious buildings; Retrofitting; Seismic waves; Seismology; Structural analysis; Ageing effects; Capacity spectrum method; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Fragility curves; Pile-supported wharf; Seismic vulnerability; Piles,0,0
13405,"To avoid exceptional seismic effects on structure during the severe earthquake, it is desirable to increase the lateral load resistant capacity of the structure, which may be done by providing reinforced concrete shear walls in the building. In recent times, precast RC shear walls are more prevalent in practice, where is the understanding of seismic behavior of such walls has not new studied adequately. In the present study, proposed building models are G+5 story reinforced concrete (RC) frame building with and without precast RC shear wall which were modeled in SAP 2000. Non-linear pushover analysis and incremental dynamic analysis are performed to assess and compare the seismic performance of both the systems. Fragility curves are developed for different damage states, i.e., slight, moderate, extensive, and complete damage based on HAZUS methodology. Fragility curves gave the probability of damage at the corresponding damage state, which is useful in seismic assessment of precast RC buildings with precast shear wall. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Seismic Performance Assessment of Reinforced Concrete Building with Precast Shear Wall,2021,Fragility curves; Incremental dynamic analysis; Precast shear wall; Pushover analysis; Seismic collapse assessment; Shear link,Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Damage detection; Earthquake engineering; Earthquakes; Geotechnical engineering; Precast concrete; Seismic response; Seismic waves; Shear flow; Shear walls; Soil mechanics; Incremental dynamic analysis; Non-linear pushover analysis; Reinforced concrete frames; Reinforced concrete shear walls; Seismic assessment; Seismic Performance; Seismic performance assessment; Severe earthquakes; Reinforced concrete,0,0
13406,"This manuscript presents a comparative study between the seismic collapse performances of steel moment resisting frames (MRFs) with the same additional damping ratio while equipped with linear and nonlinear viscous dampers. Three steel moment-resisting frames of 6, 8 and 12 stories were designed based on ASCE 7-10 with and without dampers. The characteristics of the linear (alpha = 1) and nonlinear (alpha = 0.5) dampers were then assigned while assuming equal damping ratios (20% for the models of 6 and 8 stories, and 25% for the model of 12 stories). The sophisticated nonlinear model of the structures was then developed in Opensees considering both cyclic strength and stiffness deterioration with lumped plasticity as well as the linear and nonlinear dashpot for dampers while nonlinear geometry was included in all the models. The collapse probability was calculated using well-known incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) under far-field records. The paper demonstrates that the use of damper improves the performance of the steel MRFs and reduces the collapse probability in comparison with the conventional steel MRFs. Moreover, it was observed that steel MRFs with linear dampers have better collapse performance than steel MRFs with nonlinear dampers for the same damping ratio.",Seismic performance assessment of steel moment-resisting frames equipped with linear and nonlinear fluid viscous dampers with the same damping ratio,2017,Steel MRFs; Viscous damper; IDA; Far-field records; Fragility curve,ENERGY-DISSIPATION; OPTIMAL-DESIGN; GROUND MOTION; BUILDINGS; RETROFIT; SYSTEMS; RISK,0,0
13407,"The earthquake sequence of May 2012 in Emilia (Italy) affected a region where a considerable number of modern dwellings consists of low-rise unreinforced masonry buildings. Several post-earthquake surveys revealed that the overall seismic performance of these structures was rather good, while only limited number of buildings exhibited extensive damage mainly due to peculiar structural deficiencies. The study aims at investigating the seismic performance of three modern clay masonry constructions in the area hit by the 2012 earthquake sequence in a probabilistic framework. Numerical models of the selected case buildings were developed with the aid of an equivalent-frame modelling approach employing macroelements. Fragility functions for each building were later derived to describe system failure over a wide range of shaking, accounting for the uncertainty and the randomness involved in the evaluation of structural capacity and seismic demand. © 2018 The International Masonry Society (IMS).",Seismic performance assessment of three modern masonry buildings struck by the 2012 Emilia earthquake,2018,2012 Emilia earthquake; Fragility curves; Macroelements; Modern unreinforced masonry buildings; Probabilistic analyses,Concrete buildings; Earthquake engineering; Masonry construction; Masonry materials; Seismic waves; Systems engineering; Earthquake sequences; Fragility curves; Macro element; Probabilistic analysis; Probabilistic framework; Seismic performance assessment; Structural capacities; Unreinforced masonry building; Earthquakes,0,0
13408,"A low-computational cost method is developed for seismic performance assessment of tunnel-form concrete structures under earthquake sequences. Using incremental dynamic analysis (IDA), a structure already damaged under a code spectrum-compatible mainshock is subjected to a set of aftershock events. The seismic reliability of the structure under successive earthquakes is then evaluated by comparing the fragility curves of the intact and the damaged structures. To achieve this, the newly developed endurance time approach is used to obtain the residual capacity of the structures to withstand aftershocks. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by using 5 and 10-storey 3D tunnel-form concrete structures as case study examples. It is shown that using endurance time method for seismic performance evaluation under mainshock-aftershock sequences generally leads to accurate results (less than 15% error), while it can significantly reduce (up to 90%) the computational costs of the conventional IDA method. The results also indicate that the application of the code design basis earthquake as the mainshock has no significant effect on the seismic performance of the tunnel form concrete structures under aftershocks, especially for the shorter systems. This highlights the excellent seismic resistance of tunnel-form structures under earthquake sequences. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Seismic performance assessment of tunnel form concrete structures under earthquake sequences using endurance time analysis,2021,Aftershock; Endurance time method; Fragility curves; Incremental dynamic analysis; Tunnel-form structural system,Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Concretes; Seismic design; Seismic waves; Aftershock sequence; Computational costs; Earthquake sequences; Endurance time methods; Incremental dynamic analysis; Seismic Performance; Seismic performance assessment; Seismic performance evaluation; Earthquakes,0,0
13409,"Nonlinear seismic responses of a 4-storey and 6-storey composite plate shear wall (C-PSW) are studied. A nonlinear finite element model which includes both material and geometric nonlinearities is used for this study. Nonlinear seismic analysis shows that composite plate shear walls, in high seismic region, behave in a stable and ductile manner. It has been observed that the boundary members and the reinforced concrete panel of C-PSW carry significant amount of shear which is not considered in design of C-PSW in AISC 341-10. The study also shows that design axial forces and moments in the boundary columns designed according to capacity design concepts are in good agreement with those of the nonlinear seismic analyses. A series of C-PSWs with different geometry are designed and analysed to evaluate the current period formula in building codes. It is observed that the current code predicts periods that are generally shorter than the periods obtained from finite element analysis. An improved simple formula for estimating the fundamental period of C-PSW is developed by regression analysis of the period data obtained from analysis of the selected C-PSWs. Finally, two equations for determining shear stud spacing and thickness of reinforced concrete panel for the C-PSWs are proposed. (C) 2016 The Institution of Structural Engineers.

13410,"The carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere is one of the main reasons for the corrosion of bridges, buildings, tunnels, and other reinforced concrete (RC) structures in most industrialized countries. With the growing use of fossil fuels in the world since the Industrial Revolution, the amount of carbon dioxide in urban and industrial areas of the world has grown significantly, which increases the chance of corrosion caused by carbonation. The process of corrosion leads to a change in mechanical properties of rebars and concrete, and consequently, detrimentally impacting load-bearing capacity and seismic behavior of RC structures. Neglecting this phenomenon can trigger misleading results in the form of underestimating the seismic performance metrics. Therefore, studying the carbonation corrosion influence on the seismic behavior of RC structures in urban and industrial areas is of great significance. In this study, a 2D modern RC moment frame is developed to study and assess the effect of carbonation corrosion, in 5-year intervals, for a 50 years lifetime under two different environmental conditions. This is achieved using the nonlinear static and incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) to evaluate the reinforcement corrosion effects. The reduction in the seismic capacity and performance of the reinforced concrete frame, as well as the collapse probability over the lifetime for different corrosion scenarios, is examined through the capacity curves obtained from nonlinear static analysis and the fragility curves obtained from IDA.

A practical engineering retrofitting was performed based on the proposed numerical model and design process, where the structure was subjected to the design basis earthquake (DBE) and maximum considered earthquake (MCE). The analyses demonstrated that the structural demands were clearly reduced within the thresholds, and the inner force was transferred from the existing building to the external substructure after strengthening.

13412,"This paper focuses on improvement of structural seismic performance under earthquakes of different intensities using a large mass ratio multiple tuned mass damper (LMTMD). A thermal power plant was taken as the example, and the plant was modeled using the finite element software ABAQUS. Coal buckets, which comprised 29.2% of the total mass of the structure, were used as the mass of the LMTMD. Thus, a large mass ratio was easily achieved without adding any extra mass. Incremental dynamic analysis was used to investigate the seismic fragility of the structures, and the seismic performances of the structure equipped with the LMTMD and the original structure were compared. The damping effectiveness and the control reliability of the LMTMD were evaluated. The fragility curves show that under rare earthquakes, the LMTMD reduced the probability of the moderate damage limit state by 43.9%, and under extremely rare earthquakes, the LMTMD exhibited good control robustness and reduced the probability of the severe damage limit state by 25.1%. Furthermore, the LMTMD could control the deformation pattern of the structure and effectively reduced concentrated damage, especially under high-intensity ground motions; specifically, it reduced the average value of the interstory drift ratio by 1.2%-12% and reduced the standard deviation of the interstory drift ratio by 15%-62%.

13414,"This study proposes seismic reliability-based design relationships in terms of behavior factors and displacement demands for softening and hardening structures equipped with double concave sliding bearings (i.e., DFPS). An equivalent 3dof system is adopted, that is characterized by a hardening or softening post-yield slope, representative of the superstructure response, and by velocity-dependent laws to model the frictional responses of the two surfaces of the DFPS. The yielding characteristics of the superstructures are defined for increasing behavior factors, provided by the codes, in compliance with the seismic hazard of L'Aquila (Italian site) and with the life safety limit state as provided by NTC18.

13418,"Interest in the seismic resilience of structures has led to the development of smart buildings that not only meet life safety requirements like code-compliant conventional structures, but can also adapt to, as well as recover, in the event of an earthquake. A new Hybrid Smart Rocking braced frame (HSR) is proposed, which encompasses an elastic braced framed structure with a hybrid device at the column bases of the braced spans. The hybrid device includes a Viscous Damper (VD) and Shape Memory Alloy Yielding Device (SMAYD) that individually responds to nonlinear action demand of structures so that the rest of the structure remains elastic during a seismic event. The goal of this system is to retrofit the conventional structure to the seismic resilient structure by localizing nonlinear deformations in a limited number of hybrid devices beyond the structure as structural self-centering fuses with simple inexpensive recovery and removal of residual drifts. As opposed to conventional rocking structures, HSR systems do not require an adequate restoring force provided by the tributary vertical weight to the rocking columns or post-tensioning cables, because the self-centering performance of this system can be originally supplied solely by SMAYD. To configure the system, the mechanics of the HSR system is outlined, then various HSR structures are seismically evaluated subjected to 67 far-field ground motions through Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA). In the probabilistic seismic assessment framework fragility curves, seismic collapse metrics, and hazard curves are also derived from IDA results. The results indicate acceptable structural performance of the proposed HSR structure in comparison to conventional structures. The HSR system has no residual drifts and its collapse margin ratio is about 2.6–3.7, which is sufficiently greater than 1.0. The enhanced performance of the HSR system can eliminate the need for expensive repairs or demolition as the seismic resilient structure after an event in retrofitting programs that is otherwise to be expected for conventional ductile fixed base structures, which sustain severe damage. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Seismic resilient bracing structure equipped with hybrid device at base,2020,Fragility curves; Hazard curves; Hybrid device; Probabilistic seismic assessment; Residual drift; Rocking; Seismic resilience; Self-centering; Shape memory alloy yielding device; Viscous damper,Retrofitting; Shape-memory alloy; Structural analysis; Structural frames; Conventional structures; Far-field ground motion; Fixed base structure; Incremental dynamic analysis; Nonlinear deformations; Probabilistic seismic assessment; Seismic resilience; Structural performance; Earthquakes; building; damping; deformation; dynamic response; numerical model; seismic response; structural analysis; structural response,0,0
13419,"Research and development on next-generation seismic probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) by using 3D vibration simulators is ongoing to evaluate the seismic safety performance of nuclear plants with high reliability. Most structural PRA uses probabilistic schemes such as the scheme that uses probabilistic seismic hazard and fragility curves. Even when earthquake ground motions are required in Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS), they are generated to fit the specified response spectra, such as uniform hazard spectra at a specified exceedance probability. However, these ground motions are not directly linked with their corresponding seismic source characteristics. In this context, the authors propose a methodology based on MCS to reproduce a set of input ground motions to develop an advanced PRA scheme. This advanced scheme can explain the exceedance probability and sequence of functional loss in a nuclear power plant. This paper reports the methodology to reproduce a set of input ground motions and the analytical results of a nuclear plant building using those input ground motions.

Numerical approach of Newmark's integration is adopted for solving the coupled, governing differential equations of motion of 5-and 10-story BI buildings with and without TMD schemes. A set of 40 earthquake ground motions, scaled 80 times to get 3200 ground motions, is used to develop simplified fragility curves in terms of the isolator maximum displacement. Incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) is used to develop simplified fragility curves for the maximum target isolator displacement. It is found that TMDs are efficient in reducing the bearing displacement, top floor acceleration, and base shear of the BI buildings. In addition, it was noticed that TMDs are efficient in reducing the probability of failure of BI building. Further, it is found that the MTMDs placed at the top floor and d-MTMDs on different floors of BI buildings are more efficient in decreasing the probability of failure of the BI building when compared with STMD. © 2020 by the authors.",Seismic response mitigation of base-isolated buildings,2020,Base-isolated buildings; Bearing displacement; D-mtmds; Earthquake; Incremental dynamic analysis; Mtmds; Stmd,None,0,0
13421,"The design of the seismic retrofit of a 15-story non-ductile reinforced concrete building, located in downtown Los Angeles, is presented. Built circa 1927, the building was first used as a parking structure. Then, in 1953, it was used as an office building after moderate alterations. In 2016, an adaptive reuse of the building as a hotel was envisioned, triggering the seismic retrofit. The designed retrofit complies with Los Angeles newly adopted mandatory ordinance for earthquake hazard reduction of existing non-ductile concrete building. The building is one of the first being permitted through the ordinance. As such, the strength of the lateral-force resisting system was designed to seventy-five percent (75%) of the base shear specified in the current Los Angeles Building Code seismic provisions. New concrete shear walls at strategic locations were selected for the retrofit scheme. New concrete collectors were designed to strengthened existing pan joist concrete floor diaphragms in areas with large openings. FRP wrapping is indicated for column members not designated to be part of the new lateral-force resisting system. The FRP wrapping was designed to adequately sustain gravity load effects and seismic displacement due to the full (100%) of the design story drift specified in the current L.A. Building Code seismic provisions. A seismic soil-structure interaction analysis was performed in order to design the foundation retrofit. The results were incorporated into a separate foundation model, which included compression-only springs for foundation uplifting effects. New concrete foundation was designed based on a separate analysis. A comparison between the building performance before and after retrofit demonstrates compliance with the aforementioned ordinance. Finally, a rough exercise to develop fragility curves for the building is discussed in order to prepare information for a probable maximum loss (PML) analysis for further understanding of the retrofit benefits. © NCEE 2018.All rights reserved.",Seismic retrofit of a 16-story non-ductile RC building in downtown L.A.,2018,None,Building codes; Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Ductility; Engineering geology; Office buildings; Reinforced concrete; Retrofitting; Seismic design; Seismology; Shear flow; Shear walls; Soil structure interactions; Building performance; Concrete foundation; Concrete shear wall; Foundation modeling; Foundation uplifting; Lateral force resisting system; Seismic displacement; Strategic locations; Architectural design,0,0
13422,"In 2012, the North of Italy was hit by a seismic sequence characterized by two main events occurred on May 20 and 29 with MW = 6.1 and 6.0, respectively. Those earthquakes were particularly severe toward precast Reinforced Concrete (RC) structures not designed for seismic resistance. In the past years, the authors implemented a database collecting damage data and typological information on the industrial buildings struck by the Emilia earthquakes. That database was used to develop empirical fragility curves, which highlighted the considerable vulnerability of precast buildings conceived in accordance with pre-seismic code provisions. More recently, the interventions of seismic retrofitting on the same buildings, funded by the Emilia-Romagna region and designed by engineers which were directly hired by the companies, were examined in detail and critically revisited. A selection of these interventions is presented in this paper, which analyzes the effectiveness of the various retrofitting solutions, with a specific attention to the force transfer mechanisms between existing structures and strengthening systems. The interventions are divided between column strengthening (based, for example, on RC or steel jacketing) and interventions aimed at providing the building with a suitable earthquake resistant system (based, for example, on either the use of the existing cladding panels or the implementation of new bracing systems).

The fragility curves are developed for 12-story reinforced concrete structure designed according to Saudi Building Code under dead, live and seismic loads. Three cities with different seismic intensities; Abha, Jazan and Al-Sharaf were selected to cover various values of mapped spectral accelerations in KSA. The 0.2-second spectral accelerations range from 0.21 g to 0.66 g while the 1.0-second spectral accelerations range from 0.061 g to 0.23 g. Incremental Dynamic Analysis, IDA, was performed under twelve ground motions using SeismoStruct. Five performance levels; Operational, Immediate Occupancy, Damage Control, Life Safety and Collapse Prevention, which define different possible damage states of a building after an earthquake, were considered and monitored in the analysis. Based on the results of the IDA and statistical analysis, the probability of reaching or exceeding a specific damage state was calculated for each structural model in the three cities.

13424,"In the context of seismic risk analysis of chemical plants, pressure vessels are one of the most sensitive equipment to be considered because of the quantity of hazardous products contained and the large number of vessels present in a single plant. For these reasons, this equipment must be designed to ensure safety against any low probability-high consequence event that may occur in the lifetime of a plant, and earthquakes are one of the most vivid examples of this type of occurrence. Among the possible geometrical configurations, the present study addresses the seismic risk analysis of two kinds of pressure vessels: (i) horizontal vessels supported on steel saddles and vertical rigid supports, and (ii) slender vertical vessels supported by a skirt. To identify deterministic and epistemic parameters of interest, a simulated design is first developed by considering the indications provided in the Italian seismic code applicable in the 90's for what concerns the characterization of the seismic input. Then, fragility curves are derived by means of simplified and reliable methods. Finally, the seismic risk, evaluated in terms of frequency of event per year, is related to consequence in terms of chemical release quantity, in such way that the input for further loss and emergency analysis can be defined. © 2019 Journal of Global Pharma Technology.

13425,"This study investigates the structural vulnerability of an old reinforced concrete dual wall-frame building structure, in Lisbon, Portugal. The building presents non-ductile behaviour and detailing typical of buildings designed before the introduction of modern seismic codes (pre– 1980). An analytical methodology is adopted in which multiple stripe analysis are performed on a three-dimensional model of the building. Fragility and vulnerability functions are developed for this structure, representative of a typology of old RC buildings. The fragility is derived taking into account the brittle shear failures of RC vertical members, i.e. columns and shear walls. The nonlinear dynamic analyses clearly indicate that these failure modes have a critical influence on the seismic performance of the structure. The results of this study can be used for seismic loss assessment and for the identification of appropriate mitigation strategies for this typology of existing RC buildings. © 2019 IABSE.

The financial risk assessment is determined on the basis of results of incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) of reinforced concrete frames analyzed using nonlinear time history analyses on IDARC platform with a suite of 20 ground motion records used by Vamvatsikos and Cornell (2002) for mid-rise buildings. Three frames were analyzed with capacity design concepts taking into account shear capacity, flexural capacity and contribution from floor reinforcement to beams. Maximum inter-story drift ratios obtained from time-history analyses are plotted against ground motion intensities. Results are statistically interpreted to develop cumulative distribution functions for frames. Fragility curves are plotted for HAZUS damage states of conventional structures.

13427,"A previous study by the authors provides an overview of existing seismic risk assessment approaches and available seismic fragility information and highlights the lack of relevant information for nonengineered residential buildings. The current paper proposes a procedure for developing empirical seismic fragility curves for nonengineered residential buildings using the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) seismic ground motion and shaking intensity maps presented in a geographic information system (GIS) format, to overcome the lack of ground motion recordings. The proposed procedure has been applied to a damage data set collected in Bantul Regency, Indonesia, in the aftermath of the May 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake. Fragility curves for nonengineered single-story unreinforced masonry (URM) residential buildings have been derived using the damage data set for the peak ground acceleration (PGA) and pseudospectral acceleration (PSA) as the ground motion intensity measures. The developed fragility curves indicate the high seismic vulnerability of nonengineered residential buildings. This study also demonstrates the potential of utilizing USGS seismic ground motion data to develop empirical fragility curves for nonengineered residential buildings in developing countries. In addition, a comparison of the results from other seismic risk assessment studies highlights the significant influence of the derivation method used on the fragility curve characteristics. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Seismic Risk Assessment of Nonengineered Residential Buildings in Developing Countries,2016,Developing countries; Empirical methods; Fragility; Geographic information system (GIS); Ground motion; Nonengineered construction; Seismic damage; Unreinforced masonry,Buildings; Developing countries; Earthquake effects; Geographic information systems; Housing; Information systems; Masonry materials; Risk assessment; Seismology; Empirical method; Fragility; Ground motions; Seismic damage; Unreinforced masonry; Structural analysis,0,0
13428,"The poor socioeconomic conditions in developing countries often lead to poorly constructed residential buildings that are particularly vulnerable to damage during an earthquake. A review of available literature carried out as part of a larger research program highlights the scarcity of existing fragility curves for the wide typology of nonengineered residential buildings around the world. Furthermore, fragility curves derived using empirical data are almost nonexistent due to the lack of postearthquake damage data and insufficient ground motion recordings in developing countries. The diversity in construction techniques and material quality in developing countries, particularly for nonengineered residential buildings, cannot be sufficiently represented through simplified or idealized analytical models. Therefore, the use of empirical based fragility curves is considered to be a well-suited approach for assessing the seismic risk levels for nonengineered residential buildings in developing countries. This paper presents a review and evaluation of existing seismic risk assessment studies and state-of-the-practice as it pertains to nonengineered buildings, and subsequently proposes the use of attenuation-based USGS ground motion and shaking intensity maps and geographic information system damage information to derive relevant fragility curves.

13429,"In contrast to the single design objective associated with force-based design approaches of different seismic force resisting systems (SFRSs), performance-based seismic design (PBSD) allows the selection of more than one design/performance objective. Each performance objective is linked to a tolerable risk level associated with the considered SFRS experiencing a specific damage at a specified seismic hazard level (presented in the form of fragility curves). Similar to other SFRSs, damage of reinforced masonry structural wall (RMSW) SFRSs can be linked to their lateral displacements/drifts. As such, this study focuses on using a multivariate data analysis techniques, to develop a RMSW load-displacement (backbone) model. The backbone model is calibrated using a database of RMSW experimental test results, and the model is further utilized to investigate the influence of the wall geometrical and mechanical characteristics on altering the displacement of RMSW corresponding to different performance levels. These analysis results are subsequently used to develop RMSW seismic fragility bands to facilitate visualizing the risk (losses) associated with the resulting range of displacement (drift) demands, when the different RMSW ranges of characteristics are considered. The developed fragility bands are compared to the individual fragility curves currently adopted by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA P-58 pre-standards, Seismic Performance Assessment of Buildings. This comparison shows that the developed fragility bands significantly deviate from the individual fragility curves currently adopted by FEMA P-58 at each damage state. The developed backbone model and fragility-bands are expected to not only facilitate adoption of the RMSW SFRSs in the next generation of PBSD codes, but also to equip researchers and designers with a clear understanding of the different aspects governing RMSW systems seismic performance and the associated risk. © 2017",Seismic risk assessment of reinforced masonry structural wall systems using multivariate data analysis,2017,Multivariate data analysis; Performance-based seismic design; Reinforced masonry structural wall; Risk assessment; Seismic fragility,Data handling; Earthquake engineering; Information analysis; Masonry materials; Multivariant analysis; Reinforcement; Risk assessment; Risk management; Seismic waves; Seismology; Structural analysis; Walls (structural partitions); Federal Emergency Management Agency; Mechanical characteristics; Multivariate data analysis; Performance based seismic design; Performance-based seismic designs; Seismic fragility; Seismic performance assessment; Structural walls; Seismic design; masonry; multivariate analysis; risk assessment; seismic design; seismic response; wall,0,0

The methodology adopted to perform seismic risk assessment and build national seismic risk maps was specifically developed to comply with the recent Code for Civil Protection, issuing that, in addition to a solid scientific base, risk assessment should be characterized by a wide consensus of the scientific community. As a result, six research units belonging to two Centers of Competence of the DPC, namely ReLUIS (Network of university laboratories for seismic engineering) and EUCENTRE (European Centre for Training and Research in Earthquake Engineering), collaborated under the guidance and coordination of DPC to produce the recent updating of national seismic risk maps for the residential building stock.

13431,"Tilt-up structures have been a popular construction method in the United States during the last century for industrial and more recently commercial building structures. Since the 1970s, design requirements for tilt-up buildings have changed several times in response to observed performance in moderate earthquakes, making their seismic performance highly dependent on the building code era for which they were designed. A robust method for seismic assessment is needed to support the development of resilient communities; this method should support the assessment of all common building types including tilt-up buildings. The FEMA P-58 method enables engineers to design and assess the seismic performance of buildings at a new level of detail using broadly understandable decision variables (repair cost, repair time, and casualties). Up to this point, the FEMA P-58 method has not been optimized for buildings in which the damage collects primarily in the flexible diaphragm. This study extends the FEMA P-58 method for use on tilt-up buildings in two areas: (1) Estimation of standard engineering demand parameters (EDPs) for tilt-up buildings, such as interstory drift ratio, and tilt-up specific EDPs such as roof diaphragm ductility demand, and (2) Development of fragility curves for tilt-up specific building components. © NCEE 2018.",Seismic risk assessment of tilt-up buildings using the FEMA P-58 method,2018,None,Building codes; Curve fitting; Earthquakes; Engineering geology; Maintenance; Office buildings; Risk assessment; Seismic design; Seismic waves; Commercial building; Construction method; Engineering demand parameters; Flexible diaphragms; Inter-story drift ratios; Seismic assessment; Seismic Performance; Seismic risk assessment; Architectural design,0,0

13433,"A refined seismic risk assessment at urban level is fundamental to identify the most correct risk mitigation policies, both in short and long terms. To date, seismic risk assessment frameworks at regional level consider the site response by means of simplified geotechnical analyses. This study investigates how different procedures of site response analysis influence the risk quantification at urban scale. Simplified and refined analyses are computed and compared for the urban area of Benvento, Italy. For the risk assessment, a stochastic scenario-based approach is adopted, and the risk is quantified in terms of direct losses incurred by the portfolio of buildings in Benevento for a specific historical seismic event, i.e. the 1980 Mw6.9 Irpinia earthquake. It is demonstrated that simplified approaches for the site response analysis can be unreliable, and the knowledge of the exposure behavior is a key element to appraise the importance of the site response. Finally, a risk-based microzonation is proposed, according to the new philosophy of risk-based hazard maps that may be adopted to achieve an optimal development of the urban areas, ensuring an equal distribution of the risk among the population. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Seismic risk at urban scale: the role of site response analysis,2019,Fragility curves; Ground motion prediction equations; Microzonation; Mono-dimensional propagation; Shakemaps; Shear wave velocity,Earthquakes; Equations of motion; Motion estimation; Risk perception; Seismic response; Shear flow; Shear waves; Stochastic systems; Urban growth; Wave propagation; Fragility curves; Ground-motion prediction equations; Microzonation; ShakeMaps; Shear wave velocity; Risk assessment; ground motion; prediction; risk assessment; S-wave; seismic hazard; seismic response; seismicity; structural response; wave velocity; Italy,0,0
13434,"The development of potential failure mode analysis and risk analysis has greatly improved the state-of-practice for the safety of dams. Risk analysis are well developed in many industries (such as building design, medicine, and insurance) and has greatly advanced in the dams industry over the last 40 years. Engineers and scientists are now deeply investigating and thinking about failure mechanisms associated with operating dams and the probabilities of dam failures. As such, the condition of dams and the risks associated with their operation are now being portrayed better than ever before to dam safety officials and decision-makers. Accurate and adequate risk analyses for a portfolio of dams is extremely important in today's environment to manage limited budgets and potentially save (or redirect) expensive rehabilitations to identified and critical needs. The goal is to reduce risks of a portfolio of dams in an efficient and cost-effective manner. This article provides a review on risk-based dam terminology and bridging the semi-quantitative and numerical simulation. Moreover, a review of the current state-of-practice for prioritizing a large portfolio of dams subjected to seismic loadings and potential risks is provided.

The incremental dynamic analysis method was used to conduct a structure seismic fragility assessment, in which the fragility curves as well as the damage probabilities under certain peak ground accelerations were obtained. The risk probabilities of all the seismic damage levels of the frameworks in the next 50 years were calculated using the Monte Carlo method based on a study of the seismic hazard of different fortification intensity zones. The results indicate that, in the next 50 years, the risk probabilities of fortification intensity framework models 6, 7, and 8 exceeding ""serious damage"" were 1.92, 4.25, and 8.28%, respectively. Additionally, the risk probabilities of the models having a damage degree of ""collapse"" were 0.14, 0.43, and 1.07%, respectively.

13436,"Strengthened masonry buildings are one of the most common types of old structure usually located in the ancient Algerian urban nuclei. The present study focused on common strengthened masonry buildings. Feedback from seismic experiments has shown that their dynamic behavior is generally nonlinear and highly vulnerable to earthquakes. Also, in order to predict the rate of damage that could occur to this type of structure in the event of earthquakes, empirical fragility curves based on a probabilistic method have been developed. In this study, seismic fragility analysis has been performed using the vulnerability index and the average damage rate. The vulnerability index will belong to one of three vulnerability classes determined by nonlinear dynamic analysis. The average damage is obtained using a deterministic method taking into account the vulnerability index and the seismic intensity. The fragility curves, which give the probability of achieving or exceeding a certain damage level for the three classes of vulnerability considered, have been compared to different studies that developed similar analyses.

Recent earthquakes stressed the high vulnerability of these constructions, provoking heavy structural damage and valuable losses.

In particular, the complexity related to more detailed models has induced to define simplified methods, which can be used at territorial scale for a preliminary assessment of structural capabilities of homogeneous assets aiming at providing possible post-earthquake damage scenarios and suggesting general interventions strategies. Therefore, the vulnerability assessment of churches is carried out by subdividing the buildings into separate macro-elements, accounting for different possible collapse mechanisms.

13440,"The present research aims at investigating the vibration period of structural units (SUs) of a typical masonry aggregate located in the historical center of Mirandola, a municipality in the province of Modena. The clustered building consists of eighteen SUs mutually interconnected to each other, which are characterized by solid brick walls and deformable floors. First of all, non-linear static analyses are performed by adopting the 3Muri software focusing on two distinct modelling techniques concerning the analyzed SUs in isolated and clustered configurations. Congruently to the procedure adopted, in order to evaluate a reliable seismic structural response of the SUs arranged in aggregate conditions, the contribution in terms of stiffness and mass derived from adjacent buildings is considered. The analysis results are represented in terms of risk factor, stiffness, and ductility. Secondly, the eigenvalue analysis is faithfully developed to identify the main vibration modes of the investigated SUs by proposing an empirical formulation, that allows for predicting the vibration period of structural units placed in aggregate configuration starting from the corresponding isolated ones. Finally, fragility functions are derived for both the heading and intermediate SUs to point out the expected damages under earthquakes with different intensities. © 2021 by the authors.

13441,"The main purpose of risk reduction methodological and operational approaches is to protect lives and properties against the impact of natural or industrial disaster. Although it is unrealistic to expect to live in a risk free environment, it is possible to reduce this risk through appropriate prediction and management strategies. This work presents an integrated framework for seismic damage assessment at urban scale in Algeria. Its main objective is the proposal of simplified methodological and operational approaches to assess urban vulnerability and socio-economic losses. It relies on the performance of probable seismic scenarios in urban areas exposed to earthquakes. This will enable decision makers to take adequate preventive measures and develop appropriate mitigation strategies, i.e. crisis prevention and management plans to reduce the losses. It deals with the assessment of building seismic risk of urban areas in Algeria by using the RADIUS Model (Risk Assessment Tools for Diagnosis of Urban Areas against Seismic Disaster) after a prior adaptation to the Algerian context. It estimates also the expected number of victims and their spatial distributions. This concept is adopted to estimate the urban seismic risk of the Great-Blida region (consisting of 4 cities, namely Blida, Ouled-Yaïch, Bouarfa and Beni-Mered), west of Algiers region, by performing an earthquake scenario. The region of Blida has experienced strong earthquakes during the last centuries generating seismic intensities ranging between X and XI, of which that most significant, occurred on Mars 2, 1825. It represents an important administrative, military, economic and scientific pole, and features a high concentration of population (1390 inhabitants/km2). In order to draw reliable results, an extensive survey was carried out concerning the buildings (approximately 46,000 units). The data were mapped and stored in databases using GIS tools. The results of this earthquake scenario show that serious damages would be observed in the studied area. The results reported in this study will drive the decision-making, by the local authorities, adapted to the specific socio-environmental vulnerability context at the Great-Blida urban scale. For this purpose, the paper proposes a list of operational measures contributing to the seismic risk reduction, relying on the resilience-building demand. A complementary study, i.e. a separate paper (second part), deals about assessment of seismic risk related to road infrastructures and lifelines devoted to the Algerian urban context. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Seismic vulnerability assessment at urban scale: Case of Algerian buildings,2018,Algeria; Earthquake scenario; Great-Blida; Mitigation; RADIUS; Seismic risk; Urban vulnerability,None,0,0
13442,"The nature of urban development in New Zealand and Australia followed a similar pattern, with communities frequently having a high density of unreinforceed masonry (URM) buildings at their civic centre due to the early colonial practice of repeating the style of building architecture that was fashionable in the United Kingdom during the mmid and late 1800s when the two countries experienced European colonisation. Following the 2010/2011 Canterbury earthquakes approximately 90% of the unreinforced masonry buildings that had been prevalent throughout the Christchurchh Central Business District were demolished, either because of severe building damage or beecause their cost of repair was excessive with respect to the insurance cover and the price of a new replacement building. This outcome has led to a complete change of character to the city, with very few historic buildings now remaining. These events have also underscored that similar scenarios can be expected throughout New Zealand and Australia if future earthquakes were to generate high intensity ground shaking to these URM precincts. In response to the above issues, a joint NZ-Australia research project was undertaken to investigate appropriate ground shaking scenarios and survey specially selected URM precincts. These surveys accounted for URM building construction characteristics that would influence their expected earthquake response. Pedestrian and building occupancy data were also estimated. Using empirical data from the Canterbury earthquakes, building fragility functions, volume-loss models, falling debris relationships, and correlated casualty relationships were developed. These relationships were then applied to the earthquake scenaarios to understand the likely impacts in terms of building performance and damage, the extent of casualties, impacts on cordoning decision and economic disruption, plus the benefits to be derived from a pro-active approach to seismic retrofit implementation. © 2018 The International Masonry Society (IMS).",Seismic vulnerability assessment for pre cincts of unreinforced masonry buildings in New Zealand and Australia,2018,Fragility curves; Precincts; Scenario studies; Unreinforced masonry,Concrete buildings; Maintenance; Masonry construction; Masonry materials; Surveys; Urban growth; Building construction; Central business districts; Fragility curves; Precincts; Scenario studies; Seismic vulnerability; Unreinforced masonry; Unreinforced masonry building; Earthquakes,0,0
13443,"Timisoara is the biggest city located in the Banat seismic area, the second most important seismic zone of Romania. The specificity of the area is represented by shallow earthquakes of crustal type, with small focal depths and a PGA = 0.20 g. Because Timisoara was declared the European Capital of Culture 2021, it is mandatory to assess the seismic vulnerability of its most sensitive areas and to design potential losses scenario. This study also provides useful data for the local authorities, helping them develop/improve the prevention and intervention plans. The paper focusses on the analysis of two historical urban districts, likely to be among the most attractive tourist areas. The study aims to assess the seismic vulnerability of the districts in a quick and simplified way, seeks to identify the exposure of the city, and also to provide losses statistics for a specific seismic scenario. The empirical seismic vulnerability assessment methodology is based on European studies and is applied for more than 100 historic buildings. Our assessment analysis aims to adapt the existing seismic assessment methodologies to the near-field earthquake's effects. That is why a new formula is proposed to correlate the empirical vulnerability curves with the actual damage level. The real damage state was observed on similar historical masonry buildings during the site inspection and after the past earthquakes in nearby areas. Besides, a new failure mechanism is highlighted based on the investigation of the effects of previous near-field earthquakes in the Banat seismic region.

13444,"Slender masonry structures such as towers, minarets, chimneys, and Pagoda temples can be characterized by their distinguished architectural characteristics, age of construction, and original function, but their comparable geometric and structural ratios yield to the definition of an autonomous structural type. These structures constitute a part of the architectural and cultural heritage. Their protection against earthquakes is of great importance. This concern arises from the strong damage or complete loss suffered by these structures during past earthquakes. Seismic vulnerability assessment is an issue of most importance at present time and is a concept widely used in works related to the protection of buildings. However, there is few research works carried out on developing the seismic vulnerability assessment tools for such structures. This article presents a new method for assessing the seismic vulnerability of slender masonry structures based on vulnerability index evaluation method. The calculated vulnerability index can then be used to estimate structural damage after a specified intensity of a seismic event. Here, 12 parameters are defined to evaluate the vulnerability index for slender masonry structures. Implementation of this methodology is carried out in different types of slender masonry structures to develop vulnerability curves for these structure types.",Seismic vulnerability assessment methodology for slender masonry structures,2018,Slender masonry structures; vulnerability assessment; vulnerability index; FE modeling; parametric analysis,SOPHIA BELL-TOWER; DYNAMIC INVESTIGATIONS; HISTORICAL MASONRY; DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; IDENTIFICATION; BEHAVIOR; MINARET; BELFRY; MODEL; SHEAR,0,0
13445,"The effects of past earthquakes have demonstrated the seismic vulnerability of confined masonry structures (CMSs) to earthquakes. The results of experimental analysis indicate that damage to these structures depends on lateral displacement applied to the walls. Seismic evaluation lacks an analytical approach because of the complexity of the behavior of this type of structure; an empirical approach is often used for this purpose. Seismic assessment and risk analysis of CMSs, especially in area have a large number of such buildings is difficult and could be riddled with error. The present study used analytical and numerical models to develop a simplified nonlinear displacement-based approach for seismic assessment of a CMS. The methodology is based on the concept of ESDOF and displacement demand and is compared with displacement capacity at the characteristic period of vibration according to performance level. Displacement demand was identified using the nonlinear displacement spectrum for a specified limit state. This approach is based on a macro model and nonlinear incremental dynamic analysis of a 3D prototype structure taking into account uncertainty of the mechanical properties and results in a simple, precise method for seismic assessment of a CMS. To validate the approach, a case study was considered in the form of an analytical fragility curve which was then compared with the precise method. © 2017. Techno-Press, Ltd.

13447,"(1) Background: The protection of built heritage in historic cities located in seismically active areas is of great importance for the safety of inhabitants. Systematic care and planning are necessary to detect the seismic vulnerability of buildings, in order to determine priorities in rehabilitation projects and to continuously provide funds for the reconstruction of the buildings. (2) Methods: In this study, the seismic vulnerability of the buildings in the historic center of Kaštel Kambelovac, a Croatian settlement located along the Adriatic coast, has been assessed through an approach based on the calculation of vulnerability indexes. The center consists of stone masonry buildings built between the 15th and 19th centuries. The seismic vulnerability method was derived from the Italian GNDT approach, with some modifications resulting from the specificity of the buildings in the investigated area. A new damage–vulnerability–peak ground acceleration relation was developed using the vulnerability indexes and the yield and collapse accelerations of buildings obtained through non‐linear static analysis. (3) Results: A seismic vulnerability map, critical peak ground accelerations for early damage and collapse states, and damage index maps for two return periods have been predicted using the developed damage curves. (4) Conclusions: The combination of the vulnerability index method with non‐linear pushover analysis is an effective tool for assessing the damage of a building stock on a territorial scale. © 2021 by the authors.

13448,"Seismic vulnerability analysis of historical masonry buildings, addressed to earthquake emergency management and protection strategy planning, requires large-scale vulnerability and damage assessment. In this sense, two seismic vulnerability index methods and damage estimation have been adapted and applied to a pilot-scale urban area located in Annaba city (Algeria). The first method is based on the EMS-98 building typologies, and the second is based on the Italian GNDT approach. To accomplish this task, the authors employed an existing data survey, which, however, was not originally developed for seismic purposes. It was used herein to provide input to the vulnerability methods. The main goal of this research is not only to assess the seismic vulnerability and expected damage within Annaba, but also to adapt the two mentioned approaches to the existing data survey, aiming to use such nonspecific building database and to study the possibility of its application for seismic risk estimation in similar regions. The results obtained from the application of these two methods were integrated and compared using a geographic information system, proving that the vulnerability of the buildings surveyed in Annaba is significant, and therefore risk mitigation efforts and public awareness are required. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Seismic vulnerability assessment of historical masonry buildings located in Annaba city (Algeria) using non ad-hoc data survey,2015,"Annaba, Algeria; EMS-98 approach; GNDT approach; Seismic vulnerability assessment; URM buildings; Vulnerability index",Buildings; Damage detection; Geographic information systems; Masonry construction; Masonry materials; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Surveys; Urban planning; Algeria; EMS-98 approach; GNDT approach; Seismic vulnerability; Vulnerability index; Earthquakes; disaster management; earthquake damage; GIS; historic building; masonry; typology; vulnerability; Algeria; Annaba [Algeria],0,0
13451,"This study aims to perform a fragility analysis of RC buildings subjected to seismic loading. For this purpose, the curves of fragility are developed for 20 building models with different setback values. Using a finite element calculation program, nonlinear static analyses are performed. The outcomes indicate that the performance of building structures is highly affected due to the setback. Also, the seismic fragility is more pronounced when setback passes from level 1 to level 4. The fragility analysis shows that, for a setback value equal to 50%, the difference between the probability of damage, when the setback passes from the bottom of the structure to level 4, is 12.19%, 30.85%, 37.03%, and 41.16% for a slight, moderate, severe, and complete state of damage, respectively.

13453,"Earthquakes are one of the most feared natural disasters by their nature and their unpredictable violence. Until now, it is still impossible to predict earthquakes in an acceptable way. The nature of the data needed to predict the exact date, magnitude and location of an earthquake is still unpredictable, but this can be assessed by taking appropriate measures to limit the loss and material damage caused by earthquakes. The prediction of damage to a building during an earthquake is the major concern of engineers and researchers in earthquake engineering. The use of a mechanism to identify the dispersion of damage to a reinforced concrete structure according to the ranges of values and parameters calculated for several earthquakes is necessary. Thus, Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA), which is a non-linear dynamic analysis that offers an immense opportunity to evaluate seismic responses of the structure while combining these, results with fragility curves to predict in a probabilistic way the effects of an earthquake on the structure. This work therefore makes it possible to evaluate the ability of these indicators to predict the damage of two projects of structures buildings of reinforced concrete frames, the first is a typical project of the Moroccan real estate park and the second is a structure that allows studying the height setting of the structure and number of floors. In conclusion, determine an order of magnitude of the dispersion of the damage that a structure undergoes during an earthquake characterized by its indicators and parameters. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Seismic Vulnerability Assessment of Reinforced Concrete Buildings and Establishment of Fragility Curves as a Structural Damage Prevention Criterion for the Moroccan Real Estate,2020,Earthquake; Fragility curves; IDA; Moroccan real estate stock; Nonlinear dynamic analysis; Seismic vulnerability; Sustainable development,Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Damage detection; Disasters; Dispersions; Dynamics; Earthquake engineering; Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Planning; Reinforced concrete; Structural analysis; Sustainable development; Fragility curves; Incremental dynamic analysis; Natural disasters; Non-linear dynamic analysis; Real estate; Reinforced concrete frames; Seismic vulnerability; Structural damages; Earthquakes,0,0

13455,"Performance of structures depends on the vulnerability of the structure and the seismic hazard of the region. As part of the Mediterranean-Transasian belt, the Croatian territory is located in an earthquake prone area. Implementation of earthquake-resistant building design rules is essential in order to mitigate the damages of earthquakes affecting settlement areas. Performance-based evaluation of buildings may be conducted through fragility curves developed for different levels of performance. In this paper, a reinforced concrete frame structure was designed as a moderately ductile building according to EN 1998-1:2004. Incremental dynamic analysis of the nonlinear numerical reinforced concrete model is implemented in the software package SeismoStruct, wherein the frame elements (column, beam) were defined as finite elements. The seismic risk of the model is estimated by probabilistic analysis that takes the randomness of seismic excitation into account and evaluates the probability of exceeding a certain critical condition. Seven real time histories selected from European Strong–motion Database were used. The structural behaviour is observed based on maximum interstorey drifts through the entire height of the building for each seismic excitation. The results obtained by incremental dynamic analysis of the nonlinear numerical model are also compared with an empirical seismic vulnerability method — macroseismic method. © 2019 Polish Academy of Sciences.

13456,"As a special shell structure, silos are used in storing a wide range of multitudinous granular materials. However, seldom have researchers assessed seismic vulnerability of the reinforced concrete (RC) silo. This paper aims at studying the seismic vulnerability assessment of a silo, which is located in Zhoushan, China. Prior to assessing the seismic vulnerability of the selected RC silo, the validation of the hypoplastic constitutive model, which is used to simulate granular materials, is studied. After discussing the validation of the hypoplastic theory, the numerical model considering granular material-structure interaction is developed by means of the ABAQUS software. And the numerical simulation results are compared with the experimental data obtained from a shaking table test discussed in order to confirm the validation of the numerical model, which is used to study the seismic vulnerability of the RC silo. Then the seismic fragility assessment of the selected RC silo is performed using the incremental dynamic analysis. The analytical results showed that the hypoplastic theory can be used to simulate the stored materials in the silo considering the collapse property before entering plastic state of granular materials. For the design basic acceleration, the fragility curves of the selected RC silo showed that the probability of exceeding the no or light damage state was about 2.12%. For the maximum considered earthquake, the exceeding probability of no or slight and the moderate damage states was 17.63% and 1.31%, respectively. With respect of the severe and total damage state, the exceeding probabilities were almost zero. Therefore, the selected RC silo structure has enough safety stock to withstand strong earthquakes in the future. Finally, a general design procedure considering seismic fragility assessment was presented in order to provide references for other structure design.

13457,"Thick population density and its escalation propensity in seismically active regions of Pakistan has raised sincere concerns about the performance of building stock whose suboptimal performance and complete collapses led to a colossal number of casualties during the past earthquakes. The current research is inspired by the Kashmir earthquake of 2005 which consumed more than 80,000 lives, out of which, approximately 19,000 were children due to wide spread collapse of school buildings. A new database for existing reinforced concrete (RC) school buildings in seismic zone 4 of Pakistan has been developed using the surveyed information and presented briefly. The paper presents the statistics of the data collected through field surveys and professional interviews. It was found that the infrastructural authorities in the considered region developed some specific designs for school buildings, with varying architectural and structural configurations, which were eventually replicated throughout the area. In the current study, almost 2500 schools were surveyed for identifying versatile architectural and structural configurations, and subsequently, 19 different types had been identified, which were eventually used as representative stock for the schools in seismic zone 4 of Pakistan, Muzaffarabad district. The results of the study yield the brief of the collected data from the field and a consolidated methodology for establishing the analytical fragility relationships for one of the 19 structural configurations of the school buildings. A sample building from the collected data has been selected by considering the maximum number of students, and afterwards, the vulnerability is assessed by employing incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) which constitutes the presented methodology. Finally, the fragility curves are developed and presented for the said building type. The derived analytical fragility curves for the considered building type indicate its structural vulnerability and as a whole represent its satisfactory behavior. The vulnerability assessment process and the fragility development are described in an easy manner so that the domestic practicing engineers can readily become able to extend the application towards other school buildings in the region. The developed relationships can be employed for rational decision making so that essential disaster preparedness can be carried out by identifying any need for structural strengthening and interventions. © 2019 Muhammad Zain et al.",Seismic Vulnerability Assessment of School Buildings in Seismic Zone 4 of Pakistan,2019,None,None,0,0
13458,"This paper is focused on the calibration of a simplified seismic vulnerability index method for masonry facade walls, through an innovative two-step calibration process based on two complementary approaches. The first one is based on a set of fragility curves constructed from out-of-plane damage limit states obtained from experimental data, which are used to calibrate the weights associated to the parameters of the vulnerability index method that rule the out-of-plane response of the masonry facade walls. The second approach, subsequently used to calibrate the weights of the remaining vulnerability parameters, is based on post-earthquake damage data collected after the seismic event that struck the Azores Archipelago in July 1998. The results obtained from such calibration are then presented and critically discussed taking into account not only the calibration itself, but also their reliability from the methodological point of view. Finally, the addition of three new evaluation parameters is further proposed and analysed.

To capture the potential failure mechanisms, an analytical modelling approach using nonlinear properties is developed and verified with measured data from a shake table test documented in the literature.

Then, probabilistic demand models for multiple limit states that represent potential failure mechanisms are developed with a Bayesian updating approach. These demand models are used in conjunction with appropriate capacity limits to develop fragility curves that provide a probabilistic measure of the seismic vulnerability of typical tilt-up concrete buildings.

13463,"Australia has a low to moderate seismicity by world standards. However, the seismic risk is significant due to the legacy of older buildings constructed prior to the national implementation of an earthquake building standard in Australia. The 1989 Newcastle and the 2010 Kalgoorlie earthquakes are the most recent Australian earthquakes to cause significant damage to unreinforced masonry (URM) and light timber frame structures and have provided the best opportunities to examine the earthquake vulnerability of these building types. This paper describes the two above-mentioned building types with a differentiation of older legacy buildings constructed prior to 1945 to the relatively newer ones constructed after 1945. Furthermore, the paper presents method to utilise the large damage and loss-related data (14,000 insurance claims in Newcastle and 400 surveyed buildings in Kalgoorlie) collected from these events to develop empirical vulnerability functions. The method adopted here followed the GEM empirical vulnerability assessment guidelines which involve preparing a loss database, selecting an appropriate intensity measure, selecting and applying a suitable statistical approach to develop vulnerability functions and the identification of optimum functions. The adopted method uses a rigorous statistical approach to quantify uncertainty in vulnerability functions and provides an optimum solution based on goodness-of-fit tests. The analysis shows that the URM structures built before 1945 are the most vulnerable to earthquake with post-1945 URM structures being the next most vulnerable. Timber structures appear to be the least vulnerable, with little difference observed in the vulnerability of timber buildings built before or after 1945. Moreover, the older structures (both URM and timber) exhibit more scatter in results reflecting greater variation in building vulnerability and performance during earthquakes. The analysis also highlights the importance of collecting high-quality damage and loss data which is not only a fundamental requirement for developing empirical vulnerability functions, but is also useful in validating analytically derived vulnerability functions.

13464,"Seismic vulnerability assessment of urban centers is a challenging issue that needs to be faced accurately for the earthquake risk of large territorial areas. The selection of suitable methods is a crucial aspect that must be treated according to different evaluation processes, depending on the size of the problem and on the available calculation capacities. A possible strategy consists in analyzing large stocks of buildings, so to include in the analyses all those structural parameters that characterize their response and to involve the variability of the considered features. This would require a high computational effort that should be addressed to the investigation of the response of a large number of models. For this reason, simplified procedures based on engineeristic judgements, are commonly considered a viable way to be undertaken in order to predict damage scenarios. Alternatively, the attention could be focused on a limited number of buildings that are judged to be representative of the whole stock. In this case, more sophisticated analyses could be carried out and the obtained results could be extended to the whole urban center. Based on this premise, this paper presents the results obtained through the application of two different seismic vulnerability methodologies on the historic center of Campotosto, in Italy, which was hit by the last 2016 Central Italy earthquake. The first is an empirical method, applied considering a large stock of 130 buildings, which was calibrated by the authors after the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake for historical centers that are similar to the one studied in this paper. The latter, is a method based on analytical formulations dealt with by the Vulnus software, developed at the University of Padua in Italy, which was used for evaluating the seismic vulnerability of an aggregate building, which has been considered representative of the historic center. The final aim is to compare, also in the light of the damage provoked by the 2016 earthquake, the observed post-seismic scenarios, expressed in terms of fragility curves, derived from the two applied methodologies, in order to prove their reliability and to stress the possible issues related to their implementation at different scales. © 2019 Cocco, D'Aloisio, Spacone and Brando.",Seismic vulnerability of buildings in historic centers: From the “urban” to the “aggregate” scale,2019,2016 Central Italy earthquake; Aggregate buildings; Analytical methods; Damage scenarios; Empirical methods; Historic centers; Masonry buildings; Seismic vulnerability assessment,None,0,0

13468,"This works deals with the seismic vulnerability of buildings in the Pyrenees mountains region where almost a thousand earthquakes are recorded each year in the border area. The challenge is twofold: first to detect the damage due to seismic events and then to localize it inside studied buildings. Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) coupled with numerical modelling by Finite Element (FE) constitutes an interesting approach to address these issues. Here we intend to apply such methodology on a strategic building located in Andorre-la-Vieille whose structure is complex, irregular and heterogeneous. The structural behaviour of the building is studied through frequency computation method in order to identify its undamaged behaviour. A seismic event is next simulated by a non-linear dynamic computation method which creates damage within the structure. Numerical results (natural frequencies, modal shapes and damage location) allow highlighting damaged zones induced by the earthquake and quantify degradation level in these areas. Accordingly, some guidelines may be given in view of the future instrumentation of the building (accelerometers and RAR).",Seismic vulnerability of structures: application to the Civil Protection building in Andorra,2020,Numerical modelling; operational modal analysis; seismic damage,DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; WESTERN PYRENEES; MASONRY; BEHAVIOR,0,0

The case study building comprises of shear walls and RC columns as its lateral force-resisting system. It is a newly constructed G+17 storey building and is about 78 meters high. The non-linear dynamic seismic analysis which is the time history modal analysis, also known as Fast Non-linear analysis was performed on the study building with about 45 earthquakes in 3 sets of hazard levels (2%, 5%, and 10% Probability of Exceedance [PE]) to generate the inter-story drift values. Based on the Performance-based approach given by FEMA 356, the Fragility curves are developed by creating the Probabilistic Seismic Design Modal. The resultant fragility curves are given in terms of 3 probabilities i.e., (1) Immediate Occupancy, (2) Life Safety, and (3) Collapse Prevention. The whole study depends on the idea that comparative sort of structures will have a similar likelihood of a given harm state for a given seismic force. © 2021 Materials and Energy Research Center.

13470,"The sequential ground motion effects on the dynamic responses of reinforced concrete containment (RCC) buildings with typical isolators are studied in this paper. Although the base isolation technique is developed to guarantee the security and integrity of RCC buildings under single earthquakes, seismic behavior of base-isolated RCC buildings under sequential ground motions is deficient. Hence, an ensemble of as-recorded sequential ground motions is employed to study the effect of including aftershocks on the seismic evaluation of base-isolated RCC buildings. The results indicate that base isolation can significantly attenuate the earthquake shaking of the RCC building under not only single earthquakes but also seismic sequences. It is also found that the adverse aftershock effect on the RCC can be reduced due to the base isolation applied to the RCC. More importantly, the study indicates that disregarding aftershocks can induce significant underestimation of the isolator displacement for base-isolated RCC buildings.",Sequential Ground Motion Effects on the Behavior of a Base-Isolated RCC Building,2017,None,PLASTIC-DAMAGE MODEL; STEEL FRAMES; SEISMIC PERFORMANCE; NONLINEAR RESPONSE; SECONDARY SYSTEMS; DUCTILITY DEMAND; MULTIPLE,0,0
13471,"The US Geological Survey’s ShakeMap is used domestically and globally for post-earthquake emergency management and response, engineering analyses, financial instruments, and other decision-making activities. Recent developments in the insurance, reinsurance, and catastrophe bond sectors link payouts of potentially hundreds of millions of dollars to ShakeMap products. Similarly, building codes, post-earthquake building damage forensic evaluations, and geotechnical evaluations often rely on estimated peak response-spectral values for site-specific evaluations that may lead to costly analyses, retrofits, or other expenditures. Given such activities, financial, engineering, and other technical users demand processing specifications and a metadata trail for actuarial, escrow, and forensic purposes for each significant earthquake. Recent inquiries include how and why maps change with time, how to interpret metadata, and how to obtain the creation and update history of various map layers. Similarly, the collection of ShakeMap scenarios and historical ShakeMaps—either created in earlier versions or rerun as part of the latest version of the ShakeMap Atlas—warrant a full explanation of the inputs, processing, and archiving given their contribution to fragility curve development and loss model calibration. For these reasons, in addition to event-specific ShakeMap metadata and a comprehensive online ShakeMap Manual, we have crafted this practice paper to answer several of the most frequently asked technical questions. We also describe an application programming interface (API) for accessing site-specific shaking metrics and their uncertainties for earthquake forensic purposes in a consistent fashion. In all, we describe the advantages of employing ShakeMaps for these critical purposes as well as describe their limitations and uncertainties, offering an extensive set of instructions and disclaimers that can be referenced by ShakeMap users. © The Author(s) 2021.","ShakeMap operations, policies, and procedures",2021,earthquake forensics; earthquake information tools; peak ground motions; ShakeMap,Application programming interfaces (API); Building codes; Decision making; Disasters; Earthquakes; Laws and legislation; Maps; Metadata; Risk management; Catastrophe bonds; Earthquake building damage; Emergency management; Engineering analysis; Forensic evaluation; Geotechnical evaluation; Site-specific evaluation; US Geological Survey; Forensic engineering,0,0
13472,"The city of Banda Aceh stands on Holocene fluvial basin sediment, surrounded by the Aceh and Seulimeum fault segments where large magnitude earthquakes can occur at any time. Such earthquakes could cause extensive physical infrastructure damages, injuries, and economic loss. This research aims to produce several earthquake scenarios, to determine the damage ratio of the buildings and its distribution in these different scenarios and to estimate the number of potential casualties and economic loss. Data analysis in this research includes modelling an earthquake by applying a ground motion model for shallow crustal earthquakes to yield an intensity map after the correction for site effects. The damage ratios for different types of buildings were calculated using the fragility curves of buildings that were developed by other researchers. Building occupants at different times, building damage ratios, and injury ratios were used to determine the number of injured residents in the earthquake scenario. The results show that Banda Aceh could be potentially experience earthquake ground motion within the intensity range from MMI VII to IX due to earthquakes of Mw 6.5 to Mw 7.0. The Mw 7.0 earthquake on the Aceh segment is the worst case scenario, causing building damage throughout Banda Aceh with casualty rates of 3.5–20% of the population in buildings in general if it happened during daytime, with economic loss about 3320 million USD. Mitigation and preparedness programs for the Banda Aceh community are therefore very important in order to reduce the potential level of damage, personal injury, and economic loss due to future earthquakes. © 2020, The Author(s).","Shallow crustal earthquake models, damage, and loss predictions in Banda Aceh, Indonesia",2020,Banda Aceh city; Damage prediction; Earthquake; Loss prediction,None,0,0
13473,"Performance-based earthquake engineering procedures have now developed to the point that it is possible to evaluate a range of possible decision variables, including the expected annual monetary loss (EAL). Quantification of the EAL is considered to be particularly useful because it could assist with the identification of effective design and retrofit measures that consider seismic performance over a range of intensity levels. Recognizing, however, that existing procedures for the evaluation of EAL tends to be quite time consuming, this paper builds on a recent proposal to use simplified limit state loss versus intensity relationships to compute EAL via a closed-form equation, without the need to compile an inventory of damageable components and with freedom in the choice of structural analysis method. Various developments to the simplified approach are made in this paper to allow consideration of loss thresholds, non-uniform damage distributions and the impact of differences in seismic performance in orthogonal directions. In addition, means of accounting for uncertainties in the simplified EAL assessment are described. The work has focused on the assessment of EAL for reinforced concrete frame buildings with details representative of construction practice adopted in Italy in the 1950s through to the early 1970s. By comparing loss assessment results obtained using a refined methodology with those obtained using the new guidelines developed here for two case study buildings, it is concluded that the simplified approach works well. Future research should therefore aim to further validate the approach and extend it to other building typologies and construction eras.

13474,"Probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) is essential for evaluating different options for blast risk management. However, depending on the risk management approach being considered, a rigorous blast PRA study can be quite demanding. To expedite this process, a simplified PRA framework is proposed for reinforced concrete-block shear wall buildings, in order to determine design basis threat (DBT) fragility curves based on revised damage limit states most suitable for risk assessment. The current definitions of damage states by North American standards for blast resistant design involve global response limitssuch as the support rotations of a structural elementthat are relatively simple to calculate. However, such damage state descriptors can be insufficient for the cost-benefit analysis required to evaluate different risk mitigation options. As such, building on recent advances in the area of performance-based seismic design of concrete-block shear wall buildings, this study proposes revised damage states that can be associated with more useful metrics, including repair technique and building downtime. To illustrate the proposed methodology, a hypothetical shear wall building is analyzed under different DBT levels. The DBT fragility curves are obtained through Monte Carlo sampling of the random variables describing the shear wall system and are used to identify the locations that are most suitable for the erection of barriers for blast protection. The proposed PRA framework can be used to identify target performance requirements, formulated in terms of stakeholders' tolerable probability of failure and consequent risk management, for different classes of buildings under a range of DBTs.

13475,"Flooding is a hazardous natural disaster that causes extensive damage to people and infrastructure, especially in cities. Since the content and scope of public data disclosed by each country and city differs, general flood damage assessment methods have not yet been developed. In other words, flood damage assessment methods need to be tailored to each city's public data. This study developed a methodology to easily estimate flood damage based on public data. The method can be applied to various situations and locations. The proposed urban flood damage assessment method uses a geographic information system (GIS) and open data at building scale to provide detailed damage information. Flooded areas are established using GIS, and building inundation heights are obtained from the flood map. Economical losses are derived from inundation data by calculating numbers of loss for residential buildings, industrial buildings, and human life. To validate the proposed method, a simulation using probabilistic flood map in the Masan Bay area, Republic of Korea, was conducted. In the simulation, recently published building and census data were used. The urban flood damage assessment was performed using a 200-year return period coastal flood scenario. The simulation results show that the proposed assessment method provides more detailed information on damage at the building level than regional scale damage assessment results. The results confirm the potential to improve policy decision-making and to reduce the detrimental impacts of urban flooding by adopting the proposed assessment method. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2018.",Simplified Methodology for Urban Flood Damage Assessment at Building Scale using Open Data,2018,damage assessment; Flood; GIS; Open data; Risk,building; economic impact; estimation method; flood damage; GIS; hazard assessment; return period; risk; simulation; urban area,0,0

The framework addresses the several components involved in a risk analysis and can be used as a screening procedure for the preliminary assessment of a large number of assets with limited resources. It can also be used to identify cultural heritage assets that require a more refined and resource demanding risk evaluation. The proposed risk analysis framework falls into the category of qualitative methods and is based on a series of structured questionnaires that address the main components of a risk analysis: the likelihood of the hazard, the consequences of the hazard, the vulnerability of the asset to the hazard, the loss of value of the asset and the capacity to recover from the event. In order to illustrate its application, a case study is presented in which the risk analysis is performed for a church in Italy that was damaged, in 2009, by the L'Aquila earthquake.",Simplified risk assessment of immovable cultural heritage assets,2017,Risk assessment; Vulnerability; Hazard; Immovable Cultural Heritage; Cultural Heritage value,VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; SEISMIC ASSESSMENT; FRAGILITY CURVES; EXCITATIONS; BUILDINGS; TOWERS,0,0
13477,"One of the challenges in regional seismic risk assessment studies is to generate a reliable inventory of the exposed buildings. To decrease the potential errors in identification of structural load carrying systems, a simplified building classification scheme is proposed with: one reinforced concrete building class Cs which regroups generic building classes indicated as C1, C2 and C3; and a steel building class Ss combining S1, S2, S4 and S5 generic building classes. Simplified fragility curves (SFC) representative for these combinations were developed by fitting lognormal curves through individual damage estimates for the generic classes. The average absolute deviations measured for each SFC were below 3.6%, which is considerably lower than errors observed in the building inventories, ~20%. Knowing that significant effort is needed to generate accurate regional inventories, this simplified method offers reasonable accurate damage estimates for reduced building classification scheme. © 11th National Conference on Earthquake Engineering 2018, NCEE 2018: Integrating Science, Engineering, and Policy.

13479,"A numerical algorithm is developed for estimating the life-cycle monetary losses (maintenance and repair costs) due to wind-induced damage on tall buildings. The wind loading on tall buildings is evaluated by combining the effect of buffeting forces and vortex shedding forces. The translation process theory is subsequently used to estimate the peak value of the resultant response, which is a non-Gaussian stochastic process. ""Fragility curves"", accounting for random aerodynamic coefficients due to experimental errors, are used to estimate vulnerability and wind-induced damage probability. These curves represent the probability of exceeding a given structural damage state (or performance threshold), conditional on the mean wind speed. The thresholds are based on top-floor resultant acceleration, for occupant comfort, and resultant peak displacements, for structural damage. The results of the fragility analysis and wind speed probability are subsequently used to analyze monetary losses. The cost analysis model is adapted from an existing life-cycle simulation algorithm for earthquake hazards.The pilot study employs a 183. m tall building (CAARC model).

13483,"Safety against earthquake hazards can be achieved by considering site safety against geotechnical problems and structural safety against dynamic forces. Geotechnical problems such as amplification, landsliding and soil liquefaction are dangerous in regard to the scale of damage. Assessment of risk against such problems is a part of seismic microzonation process. Seismic risk is highly affected by risk factors due to geological environment and geotechnical properties of soils. In this study, it is attempted to identify and develop hazard maps against seismic hazard for Vijayawada city, India, where the subsoil consists of thick alluvial formations along the river. In particular, the study aims at the evaluation of site effects using the available geotechnical data and carrying out microtremor testing in the study area. The geotechnical zonation of the subsoil of the city suggests a high vulnerability of the physical environment in addition to site amplification of the ground motion phenomena. The ground response analysis at the surface was conducted by 1D equivalent linear method and by microtremor testing. From the ground response analysis, peak acceleration, frequency and amplification parameters were assessed and the city was divided into different zones corresponding to each value. Liquefaction hazard was quantified using SPT-based method in combination with the dynamic analysis. These findings supply an indispensible tool for the seismic retrofitting of the buildings and for the mitigation of the seismic risk for small to medium earthquakes in the city. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Site-specific ground response analysis and liquefaction assessment of Vijayawada city (India),2016,Liquefaction; Microtremor; Seismic ground response; Site characterization,geotechnical engineering; hazard assessment; liquefaction; mapping; microtremor; seismic hazard; seismic response; site characterization; site effect; India; Vijayawada,0,0
13484,"With the devolvement of large-span structures and super high-rise buildings, lightweight aggregate concrete (LWAC) materials have been widely utilized. The main content of this work is to explore the failure and size effect of lightweight aggregate concrete-filled steel tube (LWACFST) columns under uniaxial compression. A three-dimesnional mesoscale simulation approach considering concrete heterogeneity was developed, in which the ideal bond was assumed between the steel tube and inner concretes. The failure of geometrically similar square and circular LWACFST/CFST columns under axial compression having different structural sizes and transverse constraints was modeled and explored. The size effect on the nominal compressive strength of the columns was examined. The influences of aggregate type, column cross-sectional type, and constraint effect generated by the steel tube on the size effect in axial compressive failure are also investigated. The results indicate that an obvious size effect in axial-compressive failure can be found for both LWACFST and CFST columns. With the increase of the confinement degree of steel tube, the size effect on nominal compressive strength would be weakened. The LWACFST columns exhibits a more obvious size effect than the CFST columns. Moreover, the size effect on the compressive strength of the circular columns is obviously weaker than the effect on square columns. Finally, considering the quantitative influence of confinement coefficient, a novel size effect law (SEL) for quantitatively describing the size effect in axial-loaded CFST columns was proposed. The accuracy and reasonability of the proposed SEL was verified by the available test data. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0002827.

With emphasis on risk management methods for reducing the risks to structures and people, estimating damage from potential flood events becomes an important task for identifying and implementing the optimal flood risk-reduction solutions. While traditional Flood Damage Assessment (FDA) methods focus on simple representation of buildings for large-scale damage assessment purposes, recent emphasis on buildings' flood resilience resulted in development of a sophisticated method that allows for a detailed and effective damage evaluation at the scale of building and its components. In pursuit of finding the suitable spatial information model to satisfy the needs of implementing such frameworks, this article explores the technical developments for an effective representation of buildings, floods and other required information within the built environment. The search begins with the Geospatial domain and investigates the state-of-the-art and relevant developments from data point of view in this area.

13487,"Megathrust earthquake sequences, comprising mainshocks and triggered aftershocks along the subduction interface and in the overriding crust, can impact multiple buildings and infrastructure in a city. The time between the mainshocks and aftershocks usually is too short to retrofit the structures; therefore, moderate-size aftershocks can cause additional damage. To have a better understanding of the impact of aftershocks on city-wide seismic risk assessment, a new simulation framework of spatiotemporal seismic hazard and risk assessment of future M9.0 sequences in the Cascadia subduction zone is developed. The simulation framework consists of an epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model, ground-motion model, and state-dependent seismic fragility model. The spatiotemporal ETAS model is modified to characterise aftershocks of large and anisotropic M9.0 mainshock ruptures. To account for damage accumulation of wood-frame houses due to aftershocks in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, state-dependent fragility curves are implemented.

For this reason, seismic vulnerability assessment is considered a crucial part of a strategy for seismic risk mitigation and for improving the resiliency of cities. Due to the high number of building archetypes for the seismic vulnerability assessment at a large scale, fast, simplified methods have been proposed that can facilitate the assessment procedure with low computational effort. Simplified methods can be categorized into three groups: analytical, empirical, and hybrid methods. In this study, simplified analytical methods for the seismic vulnerability assessment of unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings were reviewed, starting with their classification into three main groups: collapse mechanism-based, capacity spectrum-based, and fully displacement-based methods.

13491,"This study investigates the effect of mainshock-aftershock sequences on numerical fragility and vulnerability relationships of European reinforced concrete (RC) moment-resisting frames (MRFs). A four-story, four-bay nonductile RC MRF is selected for illustrative purposes. This index building is representative of a typical vulnerability class in the Mediterranean region. The influence of the masonry infills on seismic performance is also investigated. An advanced numerical nonlinear model is developed for the case-study frame and then assessed through nonlinear dynamic analysis using both real and artificial mainshock-aftershock sequences, via a ‘sequential cloud’ approach. The obtained seismic demand estimates allow to generate fragility functions for the undamaged frame when subjected to mainshocks only. Moreover, state-dependent fragility functions are derived for the mainshock-damaged frame when subsequently subjected to aftershocks. Damage-to-loss models, specifically calibrated on Italian post-earthquake data, are used to derive vulnerability functions for this case-study structure. Preliminary results from the study show that the frame experiences severe damages states and high losses for a range of ground-motion shaking intensities, with a clear damage increase due to aftershocks. An attempt to generate vector-valued mainshock-aftershock vulnerability relationships is finally presented.

13492,"This paper deals with the seismic vulnerability of monumental unreinforced masonry (URM) towers, the fragility of which has not yet been sufficiently studied. Thus, the present paper fills this gap by developing models to investigate the seismic response of URM towers up to collapse. On mount Athos, Greece, there exist more than a hundred medieval towers, having served mainly as campaniles or fortifications. Eight representative towers were selected for a thorough investigation to estimate their seismic response characteristics. Their history and architectural features are initially discussed and a two-step analysis follows: (i) limit analysis is performed to estimate the collapse mechanism and the locations of critical cracks, (ii) non-linear explicit dynamic analyses are then carried out, developing finite element (FE) simulations, with cracks modelled as interfacial surfaces to derive the capacity curves. A meaningful definition of the damage states is proposed based on the characteristics of their capacity curves, with the ultimate limit state related to collapse. The onset of slight damage-state is characterised by the formation and development of cracks responsible for the collapse mechanism of the structure. Apart from these two, another two additional limit states are also specified: the moderate damage-state and the extensive one.

13494,"Surface subsidence prediction is an important approach to evaluate the surface damages caused by backfilling mining activities, and is applied to guide the recovery of coal resources under buildings, railways, and water bodies. With the mining depth increasing, the mining-induced stress and bedrock ratio increase, which lead to a different strata movement rule from shallow mining. Therefore, the appropriate surface subsidence prediction method for deep backfilling mining needs to be developed. To solve this issue, the coupled simulation method is employed to investigate the features of strata structure, strata movements, and internal strata movement boundary of deep backfilling mining. The simulation results show that the overburden is relatively integrated, and the subsidence of overburden is continuous. Compared with shallow mining, the curve of internal strata movement boundary of deep backfilling is more moderate, which is in accordance with an exponential function. Based on the simulation results, the strata movement prediction model of deep backfilling mining is established with the combination of elastic foundation theory and subsidence space conservation principle, and the prediction subsidence curve basically coincides with the simulation result. This model is highly instrumental in ground environmental protection.",Strata movement and surface subsidence prediction model of deep backfilling mining,None,Deep backfilling mining; surface subsidence prediction; mining damage assessment; internal movement boundary of overlying strata; coupled numerical simulation,COAL GANGUE,0,0
13495,"This paper presents a strategy to reduce the number of data required for the in-situ health evaluation of hysteretic energy dampers used for seismic protection of building structures. Such an optimization is essential in order to implement in practice the numerous indices now available for damage assessment of structures in real time, in the context of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). In general, damage indices are implemented and verified in lab systems entailing expensive and very specialized equipment, which permits the use and management of large amounts of data. For real-time field applications, low-cost embedded computers with limited calculation and data recording capacity may be used; however, they require thorough study of the influence of variables involved in the algorithms for calculation of the damage indices, with ulterior optimization and required data reduction. While the proposed strategy can be followed in broader applications and SHM techniques, the present paper focuses on its application to data coming from vibration tests carried out to evaluate damage of a particular type of hysteretic damper, the Web Plastifying Damper (WPD). The WPD was patented by the University of Granada for the passive control of structures subjected to earthquakes, through a non-parametric damage index previously developed by the authors. This study describes two steps for reducing data: (1) An in-depth study of the calculation time spent on each step of the theoretical algorithm; (2) A parametric study of the influence of key signal parameters—window length, number of windows and duration of the signal—on the damage index calculation in order to minimize the resources needed. Results show a successful optimization that permits the damage index to be calculated with the low-cost Picocom platform. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Strategy for required data reduction in the practical implementation in a low-cost electronic platform of an index for damage assessment of seismic dampers,2018,Data reducing; Hysteretic dampers; Optimization algorithms; Structural health monitoring,Cost reduction; Costs; Damage detection; Damping; Hysteresis; Information management; Optimization; Seismology; Shape optimization; Structural health monitoring; Structural optimization; Data reducing; Hysteretic damper; Large amounts of data; Low-cost electronics; Optimization algorithms; Specialized equipment; Structural health monitoring (SHM); Theoretical algorithms; Data reduction,0,0
13496,"The purpose of this paper is to estimate the stiffness and strength of damaged rectangular reinforced concrete shear walls after an earthquake using surface crack patterns. Assessing the damage severity of buildings after an earthquake is an important part of the emergency inspection operation of buildings. Expert inspectors tag buildings into two categories of safe or unsafe that are usually affected by subjective decisions, which may result in catastrophic events reported in previous earthquakes. In this research, an extensive database on the images of damaged rectangular reinforced concrete shear walls (RCSWs) is collected and used to develop predictive equations for updated stiffness and strength of damaged walls. Based on the crack patterns extracted from images of the shear walls in different loading states, empirical relationships for predicting reserved strength and stiffness of damaged RCSWs are proposed. These equations are developed based on the fractal quantities of surface crack patterns and structural data for various possible scenarios using symbolic and Bayesian regression. Finally, a damage index is proposed based on the crack pattern of RCSWs that can be used for automated post-earthquake evaluation of buildings. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Strength and stiffness estimation of damaged reinforced concrete shear walls using crack patterns,2020,damage assessment; image processing; reinforced concrete shear wall; stiffness and strength loss; surface crack pattern; visual assessment,Beams and girders; Damage detection; Earthquakes; Image processing; Shear walls; Stiffness; Surface defects; Damage assessments; Reinforced concrete shear walls; Strength loss; Surface cracks; Visual assessments; Reinforced concrete,0,0
13497,"The study and understanding of the structural behavior of earth as a construction material are key to proposing compatible interventions that guarantee the durability and stability of earthen buildings, especially in seismic regions. Nonlinear calculation methods such as damage models are of great use in the mechanical assessment of earthen buildings. However, these procedures require accurate knowledge of the mechanical properties of the material, such as compression strength, tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, and fracture energy, if they are to provide truly precise results.

13498,"An earthquake of M-W = 6.5 occurred on May 24, 2014, at 12:25 h local time (09:25 GMT), its epicenter in the Aegean Sea, 25 km north of Gokceada. The effect of the earthquake produced the most damage in the rural houses of Gokceada. This paper describes the evaluations made through onsite field observations of the damages inflicted on the structures of thirty rural houses in the Tepekoy settlement connected to Gokceada. An evaluation was made of the types of damage, the mechanisms of damage and the causes of the damage sustained by these houses, which all had similar structural characteristics but different plan typologies and suffered varying levels of damage. The damage observed in Gokceada was classified using the catalogue of mechanisms originally developed for the failure mechanisms identification and vulnerability evaluation procedure. The general types of damage were cracks in the loadbearing external walls and corners, diagonal cracks starting from the corners of doors and windows, vertical out-of-plane displacement of external walls, out-of-plane fragmentation or disintegration and collapse of external wall and partial collapse of loadbearing internal walls, ruptures in the outer surfaces of loadbearing external walls, partial collapse of roof structure, partial collapse of hearth and chimney sections, rupture or flaking of window and door lintels. The causes of the general damage may be cited as an irregular bonding system, weak mortar, stone block formation, stone block size, absence of tie beams, corners weakly connected, weak connection of wall-roof system, week connection of wall-floor system, and different internal wall systems. The levels of damage and the mechanisms of damage vary depending upon the number of causes of the damage, the particulars of the layout, and some structural properties. In terms of the characteristics of the layout, an increase in unsupported loadbearing wall lengths led to more destructive damage mechanisms in the houses. In terms of structural characteristics, the construction of the internal wall system with timber on the upper floors, and with stone material on the lower floors was a major factor in increasing the level of damage and determining its type and mechanism.","Structural evaluation of masonry building damages during the April 24, 2014 Gokceada earthquake in the Aegean Sea",2020,Agean Sea earthquake; Masonry buildings; Earthquake damage; Field investigation; Earthquake damage assessment,NORTH; PERFORMANCE; TURKEY,0,0
13499,"In this article, a framework of building monitoring is developed and transient and permanent variations of the fundamental period of vibration caused by both damage and repair interventions are investigated. The buildings of the University of Ferrara (Emilia-Romagna Region, Northern Italy), struck by the 2012 Emilia seismic sequence, were monitored using both temporary and permanent equipment: the first one to perform ambient vibration tests and the second one to implement permanent real-time monitoring for earthquake recording. Three on-demand ambient vibration tests were performed at each floor of the buildings: the first dataset was acquired a few months before the mainshock occurred on 20 May 2012 (ML = 5.9, 6.8 km depth and 30 km epicentral distance); the second was acquired right after the end of the sequence, when the building showed slight damage (degree 1 according to the European Macroseismic Scale 98); finally, the third dataset was acquired in 2016 after the repair intervention. The data analysis clearly documented the permanent drop of the first vibration frequency as a symptom of the damage and its partial recovery that followed the repairs. The permanent real-time monitoring system, despite the fact that it was implemented using low-cost sensors, provided an insight into the intra-event frequency variation, allowing in turn a preliminary damage assessment. © The Author(s) 2019.","Structural health monitoring of the Ferrara University before and after the 2012 Emilia (Italy) earthquake, and after the damage repairs",2020,ambient vibration test; Emilia earthquake; frequency variation; real-time earthquake monitoring; Structural health monitoring,Damage detection; Earthquakes; Monitoring; Repair; Statistical tests; Vibration analysis; Ambient vibration test; Earthquake monitoring; Earthquake recording; Epicentral distances; Frequency variation; Real time monitoring; Real time monitoring system; Vibration frequency; Structural health monitoring,0,0
13500,"In this article an overall procedure is proposed, for the numerical investigation of the structural response of ancient monuments made of megalithic stones. The procedure is implemented on the middle temple of the Mnajdra Megalithic structure, listed as UNESCO World Heritage and regarded as one of the oldest structures from early civilization dating back to about the 4th millennium BC. First, the geometry of the structure is obtained from a point cloud using terrestrial laser scanning. To investigate and estimate the material properties of the structural system, parametric eigenvalue analysis is conducted using the finite element method and results are compared with experimental data from ambient vibration sensors applied to the same structure. The structural response of the system is then evaluated, using nonlinear finite element analysis. Variation of unilateral, frictional contact conditions between megaliths in a preceding analysis step may influence the eigenvalue analysis which follows, indicating the importance of the proper consideration of contact conditions, on the response of the structure. An old collapse in a part of the structure is also reproduced by the numerical model. The proposed scheme, which combines numerical analysis and experimental vibration output to derive structural properties of the monument, can be used in similar structural systems, consisting of multi-body megalithic stones.

13501,"This study aims at presenting the analyses of monitoring data that have been used in the context of structural monitoring and Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) for a hospital building in Thessaloniki. Permanent and temporary instrumentation arrays, implemented under the responsibility of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (SDGEE-AUTH) in close cooperation with German Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) are presented. The ambient noise data recorded at the temporarily installed networks are used for the dynamic characterization of the building based on both vibrational and waveform approaches. Moreover, long-term ambient noise recordings from the permanent array installed within the hospital are used for the investigation of the daily and seasonal wandering of the building resonance frequencies related to environmental effects. The modal identification results are used in a comprehensive framework for the computation of the up-to-date fragility curves representing the actual structural state considering aging effects of the construction materials, possible pre-existing damages and changes in the geometry and mass distribution. The building-specific fragility functions are integrated into two independent EEW systems and rapid damage assessment approaches, namely the PRESTo software and an onsite EEW algorithm on the instruments of the permanent array, to provide the expected level of damage after strong ground shaking at the monitored building.

13502,"Damage assessment of concrete components is of vital importance for ensuring the safety of civil structures. The occurrence and development of cracks in reinforced concrete components are highly related to the damage condition. Based on the fractal characteristics of concrete cracks, a rapid damage assessment method of concrete components using the index of Fractal Dimension (FD) was proposed in this paper. Damages in structural concrete components were first categorized into four empirical levels according to the so-called loading-ratio. Through image processing of the crack developments from previous studies of concrete beam and column members at different loading stages, database of crack FD versus loading-ratio for concrete beams and columns were separately built. Linear regressions correlating the crack FDs and the loading-ratios were then constructed and validated for concrete beams and columns, respectively. The loading-ratio can be predicted by the linear regression using new crack FD of the concrete component for damage assessment. The proposed method was applied to a lab-tested specimen of a reinforced concrete shear wall - beam assembly. Results show that the proposed fast structural performance assessment method is reliable for identifying potential damage levels in concrete components.",Structural performance assessment of concrete components based on fractal information of cracks,2021,Crack identification; Fractal dimension; Damage assessment; Image processing; Concrete component,DAMAGE; ROUGHNESS; BEHAVIOR; TEXTURE,0,0
13503,"A straightforward use of coarsely-crushed demolished concrete lumps (DCLs) mixing with fresh concrete (FC) has recently been suggested by the authors and co-investigators, with a desire to provide another option for recycling concrete waste. Due to their being free of strong, costly crushing, the DCLs termed herein are characterized by larger size than conventional recycled aggregates. Bearing in mind this salient feature, the proposed recycling approach is easy to follow: a pre-determined percentage of DCLs, along with FC of complementary amount, can be placed in layers into a hollow steel tube, thereby forming a new structural member named steel tubular column filled with DCLs and FC. Field practice has demonstrated constructability of the proposed columns, as well as their advantages of being low-impact and cost-effective. In this research, several aspects pertaining to the structural response of said columns under concentric and eccentric loadings are addressed. An experimental program was first carried out, which comprised 24 intermediately slender thin-walled circular steel tubular columns filled with DCLs and FC, accompanied by 12 reference columns filled with FC alone. Primary test variables were the replacement ratio of FC by DCLs, the eccentricity of loading, and the thickness of steel wall. It was observed that, despite a noticeable reduction on ultimate strength, the overall structural performance of the proposed columns was not dramatically compromised, even though as much as 40% of FC was replaced by DCLs. Subsequently, a three-dimensional finite-element model is developed, attempting to understand the effect of random spatial distribution of DCLS on the ultimate strength of the columns, with the aid of Monte Carlo simulation technique. Stochastic simulations indicate that heterogeneous locations of DCLS lead to variations in the ultimate resistance, but such effect is generally limited in a probabilistic sense. This implies that when designing the columns concerned, a homogenization-based estimate of the resulting compressive strength of concrete infill may be reasonable and adequate, irrespective of the locations of DCLs. To examine this, lastly, a code-based design discussion is made, involving comparisons between analytical predictions using design provisions and experimental results of 111 pertinent column tests. A unified, simplified and more robust recommendation for determining the axial and axial-flexural capacities of the proposed columns is accordingly suggested, relying upon a strength-reduction factor of 0.9. 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

13504,"Safety analysis of nuclear power plant (NPP) especially in accident conditions is a basic and necessary issue for applications and commercialization of reactors. Many previous researches and development works have been conducted. However, most achievements focused on the safety reliability of primary pressure system vessels. Few literatures studied the structural safety of huge concrete structures surrounding primary pressure system, especially for the fourth generation NPP which allows existing of through cracks. In this paper, structural safety reliability of concrete structures of HTR-PM in accidental double-ended break of hot gas ducts was studied by Exceedance Probability Method. It was calculated by Monte Carlo approaches applying numerical simulations by Abaqus. Damage parameters were proposed and used to define the property of concrete, which can perfectly describe the crack state of concrete structures. Calculation results indicated that functional failure determined by deterministic safety analysis was decided by the crack resistance capability of containment buildings, whereas the bearing capacity of concrete structures possess a high safety margin. The failure probability of concrete structures during an accident of double-ended break of hot gas ducts will be 31.18%. Adding the consideration the contingency occurrence probability of the accident, probability of functional failure is sufficiently low.

Following a discussion on the development of the historic centre and the main construction typologies, the paper presents the main outcomes of an extensive in-situ survey for collecting structural information on the buildings. Statistics regarding the data are given and shown in a GIS environment. The collected data are then used to implement an empirical model for the seismic vulnerability assessment of a significant part of the historic centre. The model is derived using a methodology already proposed by the authors for Italian historic centres. The original model is adapted to the peculiarities of the structural typologies found in Cusco.

13506,"The seismic vulnerability and damage assessment of heritage buildings at the regional scale can be considered a complex measurement problem that has suggested the development of specific multi-level procedures based on the inventory and classification of typological, constructive features, vulnerability parameters, potential or existing damage. Ancient masonry churches represent a particularly vulnerable architectural typology and the experience progressively acquired during post–earthquake observations have pointed out that recurrent damage patterns and main failure mechanisms can be identified by separately looking at the different architectural “macro–elements”, through on-site surveys. In the last few years, the macro-element approach has been extensively and fruitfully applied to perform preliminary vulnerability assessments, by recognizing the correspondence between each structural macro-element and the most recurrent collapse mechanisms associated. This paper deals with the measurement problem of damages to evaluate seismic vulnerability of historical masonry buildings. To this aim an information system is proposed consisting of a computer platform (named Quality Detection Platform - QDP) and a mobile device dedicated for data acquisition supported by Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The QDP evaluates a vulnerability index by using the macro-element approach and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to improve the interpretations of the obtained measures and calibrate the relative importance of the kinematic and static criteria and automatically assign the weight to each mechanism. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Structural vulnerability assessment of masonry churches supported by user-reported data and modern Internet of Things (IoT),2019,Analytic Hierarchy Process; Building vulnerability; Distributed measurement system; Heritage masonry buildings; Macro-element approach,Analytic hierarchy process; Damage detection; Data acquisition; Failure (mechanical); Macros; Masonry construction; Masonry materials; Mobile devices; Seismology; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Building vulnerabilities; Distributed measurement systems; Internet of Things (IOT); Macro-element approaches; Masonry building; Structural vulnerability assessments; Vulnerability assessments; Internet of things,0,0
13507,"The Strut-and-Tie-Model (STM) of a confined masonry wall, with or without opening, consists of an equivalent system, in which the masonry wall is modelled as compression struts and the reinforced concrete (RC) confining elements are modelled as is (i.e., as present in the wall). Tension ties are ignored owing to the negligible tensile strength of masonry. Although the joints of tie-column and tie-beams are not intended for moment resisting, these are yet treated as the moment resisting in numerical model to avoid instability. Consequently, a typical compression strut is connected to the joints at either end with moment released. Purpose of this paper is to outline the guidelines for developing STM5 for seismic design of confined masonry wall panels, including single- and multi-storey wall panels with and without openings. Behaviour of two single-storey adjacent panels with or without openings, are also considered. Although the main objective is to develop STM5 for walls subjected to lateral seismic loading, the effect of gravity load has been also considered in the analysis. Well distinct STM configurations are noted for the single storey panels. STM for adjacent wall panels and multistorey wall are shown to be arrived at from that of the individual single storey panels. Throughout this paper, the masonry is modelled using equivalent properties and hence, the effect of relative variation of mortar and brick properties are not adequately captured. This may have considerable influence on the resulting STM configurations. Although STM should be evolutive in nature enabling prediction of different failure modes of CM walls, the scope of the analytical model in this paper is limited to the linear-elastic analysis and hence, the strut orientation is likely to be altered as the building ventures into the inelastic regime. Nevertheless, the STM proposed in this paper may be used as the basis of developing such an evolutive model enabling a displacement based design framework of confined masonry buildings.

13508,"The criterion of structural seismic collapse is the key problem for analyzing structures under strong earthquake attacking. Based on the layer damage model, this paper established a damage model of building structure based on pushover analysis. By selecting a two-story, two-span plane steel frame structure tested in China under cyclic loading, the finite element program ABAQUS was utilized to simulate the collapse behavior of the steel frame structure under strong earthquake attacking. The collapse process of steel frame structure is analyzed, and the damage evolution mechanism of steel frame structure was studied based on the proposed criterion of seismic collapse. The results show that the sequence of damage development of steel frame structure under strong earthquake is consistent with that of plastic development; the damage model of the structure based on pushover analysis reflects the damage evolution mechanism of the steel frame structure well subjected to strong earthquakes, and has good converge at the upper and lower bounds. Under strong earthquake attacking, the initial damage of the steel frame structure is mainly caused by the residual lateral displacement of the structure, and the damage raised at the final stage is mainly caused by the degradation of the strength and the stiffness of the structure. © 2018, Editorial Board of World Earthquake Engineering.

13509,"A rapid mapping of landslides following a disaster is important for coordinating emergency response and limiting rescue delays. A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can provide a solution even in harsh weather and at night, due to its independence of weather and light, quick response, no contact and broad coverage. This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive exploration on the intensity and coherence information of three Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) SAR images, for rapid massive landslide mapping in a pixel level, in order to provide a reference for future applications. Applied data were two pre-event and one post-event high-resolution ALOS-2 products. Studied area was in the east of Iburi, Hokkaido, Japan, where massive shallow landslides were triggered in the 2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake. Potential parameters, including intensity difference (d), co-event correlation coefficient (r), correlation coefficient difference (Delta r), co-event coherence (gamma), and coherence difference (Delta gamma), were first selected and calculated based on a radar reflection mechanism, to facilitate rapid detection. Qualitative observation was then performed by overlapping ground truth landslides to calculated parameter images. Based on qualitative observation, an absolute value of d (d(abs1)) was applied to facility analyses, and a new parameter (d(abs2)) was proposed to avoid information loss in the calculation. After that, quantitative analyses of the six parameters (d(abs1), d(abs2), r, Delta r, gamma and Delta gamma) were performed by receiver operating characteristic. d(abs2) and Delta r were found to be favorable parameters, which had the highest AUC values of 0.82 and 0.75, and correctly classified 69.36% and 64.57% landslide and non-landslide pixels by appropriate thresholds. Finally, a discriminant function was developed, combining three relatively favorable parameters (d(abs2), Delta r, and Delta gamma) with one in each type, and achieved an overall accuracy of 74.31% for landslide mapping.",Study on the Intensity and Coherence Information of High-Resolution ALOS-2 SAR Images for Rapid Massive Landslide Mapping at a Pixel Level,2019,landslide; synthetic aperture radar (SAR); intensity; coherence; ALOS-2,BUILDING DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; 2018 HOKKAIDO; EARTHQUAKE; INTERFEROMETRY; GORKHA; AREA,0,0

13511,"Construction of concrete infrastructures is developing worldwide from the ancient period therefore; sustainable concrete is required for clean environment reason. The formation of cracks/fissures creates problems to the concrete which reduces durability of concrete structures. These cracks/fissures in concrete originate due to the natural forces viz., weathering and landslide, seismic, flooding and human interventions which affect the service life of structures. The application of microorganisms in concrete is the innovative technology for sustainable construction and self-healing of cracks. These microorganisms' bacterium produces calcium carbonate in presence of moisture and carbon dioxide. The use of bacteria in concrete consumes carbon dioxide available in the atmosphere and produces solid substances like calcium carbonate for self-healing of the cracks and develop sustainable infrastructure. Electro-Mechanical Impedance (EMI) technique is based on smart materials and used for monitoring of crack/fissures present in structures. The impedance and admittance signatures can be used for determination of the presence of damage. Admittance signature consists of conductance (real part) and susceptance (imaginary part) signature, respectively. The changes in the signature from the healthy state baseline signature indicate presence of damage in structures. The research review article is focused on microbial-based concrete and its importance related to the clean environment and sustainable construction development. Furthermore, the types of bacteria used in concrete and its optimal concentration have been covered. Moreover, the EMI technique and its application on concrete industry for monitoring the health of structures have been taken into consideration.

13512,"Flood risk is increasing rapidly around the world owing to the influence of climate change on precipitation levels. The refurbishment process is a complicated method of building construction after flooding. This study assesses all building costs in parallel with environmental emissions after repairs in a flood zone, in non-flood situations and when a flood hits the building, to determine the feasibility of repairs. Five types of building materials including common brick, concrete block, steel wall panels, wood, and precast concrete framing were assessed with a full life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost (LCC) assessment under non-flood, low-flood, and high-flood conditions. The result of greenhouse gas analysis showed that timber was the best choice for constructing the building, while, in case of flood occurrence, precast concrete framing shows better performance by releasing less CO 2 after the repair stage. The result of cost analysis indicated that despite timber being an ideal material for use in building construction, it is the costliest option in a high-flood situation due to its high repair costs. The benchmark results show that timber and steel frame were the worst materials to use in a flood zone, while brick was the most sustainable one. The findings of this paper prove that wood as a building material in flood zones is not ideal and that alternative materials such as brick have better functionality in terms of both global warming mitigation and LCC.

13515,"Numerous bridges with piers over 40 m are constructed in Southwest China, which is known as a region of high seismicity. In current research, this type of bridge is commonly simplified as a single-column system, and researchers mainly focused on how seismic performance is affected by the higher modes of columns. This study aims to investigate the seismic behavior of the entire system of tall-pier bridges subjected to near-fault ground motions, using probability-based fragility analysis. A numerical model of the entire bridge system is constructed incorporating the effects of higher-order modes of pier columns and the influence of various structural components as bearings, shear keys, and end abutments. Both pier columns and rubber bearings are considered as vulnerable components during fragility analysis. With probability seismic demand models (PSDMs) developed from extensive nonlinear time history analyses, both component-level and system-level fragility curves of the prototype bridge are constructed and compared. The results show that bridge performance is usually dominated by rubber bearings, rather than pier columns, and the relative vulnerability of components might change with the intensity of input motions. This fact implies that only focusing on the seismic demands of pier columns, as is usual in current investigations, is insufficient in estimating the damage states of tall-pier bridges; failure of bearings should be carefully considered in engineering practice as well. Furthermore, compared with fragility curves of individual components, higher seismic vulnerability is observed in those corresponding to the entire system, indicating that the seismic fragility of tall-pier bridges should be assessed at the system level rather than component level. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",System Fragility Assessment of Tall-Pier Bridges Subjected to Near-Fault Ground Motions,2020,Near-fault motions; Probability seismic demand models; System-level fragility assessment; Tall-pier bridges,Bearings (structural); Building components; Nonmetallic bearings; Probability; Railroad bridges; Rubber; Seismology; Shear flow; Engineering practices; Fragility assessment; Individual components; Near fault ground motion; Near-fault motions; Nonlinear time history analysis; Seismic demand models; Seismic vulnerability; Piers,0,0
13516,"Damage state (DS) assessment of reinforced masonry shear wall (RMSW) building systems is key for developing simulation tools for pre- and post-earthquake risk-assessment frameworks. However, the majority of available RMSW damage models are generated based on DSs that are identified from component testing and/or modeling. Recent system-level studies showed that individual wall (component-level) responses might vary significantly from those observed when similar components are tested within an RMSW building (i.e., at the system level). Subsequently, in working toward more representative damage models for the next generation of seismic risk assessment standards, the current study focuses on developing a system-level-based damage state (SDS) assessment methodology as an alternative to the currently adopted component-level-based damage state (CDS) assessment approaches. Within this focus, and based on the available building response knowledge levels and expected component damage sequence, four SDS assessment methods, linked to different system-level damage indicators, are proposed. To demonstrate the application of the proposed methodology, the experimental results of a two-story RMSW building tested under simulated seismic loading are adopted in the current study. The results show that response predictions based on the CDS might be unconservative due to possible unexpected system-level failure modes and load-resisting mechanisms. The study shows that some RMSW system-level mechanisms (e.g., wall-diaphragm coupling), and the subsequent damage, cannot be evaluated through component-level testing. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",System-Level Seismic Damage Assessment Methodology for Reinforced Masonry Shear Wall Buildings,2018,Component-level response; Damage indicators; Damage states; Masonry building; Performance-based seismic design; Sliding failure; System-level damage,Masonry materials; Reinforcement; Risk assessment; Seismic design; Seismology; Shear walls; Structural analysis; Component levels; Damage indicator; Damage state; Masonry building; Performance based seismic design; System levels; Damage detection,0,0
13517,"The concept of seismic resilience plays an important role in seismic assessment of structures as it assesses the capability of a system to withstand an unwanted event, such as earthquakes, by estimating the losses and determining the system's functionality and sustainability during and after such event. In this study, a framework was utilized to assess the seismic resilience of Reinforced Masonry Shear Wall (RMSW) buildings as well as studying the impact of incorporating Masonry Boundary Elements (MBEs) at the ends of RMSW. To achieve this goal, a ten-story RMSW building was numerically modelled in OpenSees to assess the seismic performance and resilience of the system when adding confined MBEs. The selected building is located in Montreal, Canada, and initially designed to be built having rectangular walls. Subsequently, the walls were redesigned to integrate MBEs at their outermost fibre to help increase the ductility and strength of the RMSWs. A full 3D wide-column macro-modelling approach was used to simulate the dynamic response of the archetype building. Validation of the modelling approach was done against available experimental tests as an initial step to ensure the robustness of the model in predicting the inelastic response of the building. Subsequently, the models were analyzed against multiple ground motion records using Incremental Dynamic Analysis to identify the initiation of collapse alongside developing the fragility curves of the building. The system-level seismic performance of the building was assessed after incorporating MBEs. The resilience of the building was assessed using the developed fragility functions, and a comparison was made to highlight the effect of using MBEs on the response of the studied RMSW building. The results showed a significant enhancement in the seismic resilience of the building by using confined MBEs at the shear walls’ extreme. © 2020 Institution of Structural Engineers",System-level seismic resilience assessment of reinforced masonry shear wall buildings with masonry boundary elements,2020,Fragility Functions; Incremental Dynamic Analysis; Macro-modelling approach; Masonry Boundary Elements; Reinforced Masonry; Seismic Resilience,None,0,0
13518,"The development of system-level seismic fragility curves, which describe the probability of building systems reaching different damage states under a given ground motion intensity level, is an essential step in preearthquake and postearthquake risk assessment and resilience quantification. Nonetheless, current methodologies for generating fragility curves do not provide clear directions regarding how to integrate the fragility of different building components within the overall building seismic risk assessment. However, several recent studies demonstrate that neglecting some of these components' contributions may lead to an erroneous seismic risk prediction of the overall building system. Recent research has also emphasized the need to develop alternative techniques to evaluate the system-level fragility to be adopted in the next generation of seismic risk assessment and resilience quantification standards. To address these issues, this study presents a new methodology that adopts two approaches, based on either component-level seismic losses or component strengths, to evaluate the overall system-level fragility. To demonstrate its practical application, the methodology is used to generate fragility curves for a reinforced masonry shear wall building with boundary elements. In this respect, OpenSees is used to develop a three-dimensional model of the building and subsequently conduct incremental dynamic analyses (IDA) by using a suite of 44 ground motion records. On the basis of the IDA results, component-level damage states are identified and used to generate component-level and, subsequently, system-level fragility curves. The analysis results show that the two proposed approaches yield consistent results, for the studied building configuration, that fall between a lower- and an upper-bound fragility estimate of the individual building components. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.",System-Level Seismic Risk Assessment Methodology: Application to Reinforced Masonry Buildings with Boundary Elements,2017,Boundary elements; Concrete and masonry structures; Nonlinear analysis; OpenSees; Reinforced masonry; Resilience; Seismic fragility; Seismic risk; System-level behavior,Boundary element method; Building components; Buildings; Damage detection; Masonry materials; Nonlinear analysis; Reinforcement; Risks; Seismology; Boundary elements; Masonry structures; Opensees; Reinforced masonry; Resilience; Seismic fragility; Seismic risk; System levels; Risk assessment,0,0
13519,"Taiwan Earthquake Model (TEM), established in 2012, aims to understand the probability of seismic hazard and the further risk analysis by integration of the earthquake science, earthquake engineering and social science communities of Taiwan. Under the scope of TEM, we provide new insight into seismic hazard and risk assessments for Taiwan. Seismic hazard model consists of two major components: the seismotectonic model and the ground shaking model for the Probability of Seismic Hazard Assessment (PSHA) by GEM OpenQuake Engine. The disaggregation of the seismic hazard and hazard curves from TEM PSHA2015 for metropolitan cities brought the public awareness. An occurrence of a moderate earthquake with significant damage in 2016 following the publication of Taiwan PSHA map was an important alert to the government and the industrial community. We further compiled the fragility curves using the damaging data of the 1999 Chi-Chi (7.6) earthquake, and the 2016 Meinong (6.3) earthquake to justify the exiting fragility curves. The development of these fragility curves is a key to link the hazard analysis from science to risk assessment and management. We hope through this exercise, we can establish the database for seismic hazard and risk assessment, and, also for the next step on scenario based model. © 2018 11th National Conference on Earthquake Engineering 2018, NCEE 2018: Integrating Science, Engineering, and Policy.

13520,"The absence of clear target safety levels for structural fire safety severely hampers probabilistic structural fire design. In support of a generalized definition of target safety levels for structural fire safety engineering, optimum target safety levels for insulated steel beams are determined as a function of the fire characteristics by applying lifetime cost optimization (LCO) techniques. Where the fire development characteristics support the prospect of flashover, the Eurocode parametric fire curve is considered, otherwise fires are assumed to roam in search of fuel, leading to spatial variations in temperature, with thermal exposure to structural elements described via travelling fire methods. Fragility curves are derived as a function of, amongst others, the insulation thickness and fire load density, and applied in the LCO evaluations. The LCO results in an assessment of the optimum investment level as a function of the fire, damage and investment cost parameters characterizing the building. It is intended that the current contribution can be a stepping stone towards rational and validated reliability targets for PBD in structural fire safety engineering. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, London.","Target safety levels for insulated steel beams exposed to fire, based on lifetime cost optimisation",2019,None,Damage detection; Fire protection; Fires; Life cycle; Microalloyed steel; Steel beams and girders; Development characteristics; Fire load density; Insulation thickness; Optimum investments; Spatial variations; Structural elements; Structural fire design; Structural fire safeties; Cost engineering,0,0
13521,"Earth Observation satellite imaging helps building diagnosis during a disaster. Several models are put forward on the xBD dataset, which can be divided into two levels: the building level and the pixel level. Models from two levels evolve into several versions that will be reviewed in this paper. There are four key challenges hindering researchers from moving forward on this task, and this paper tries to give technical solutions. First, metrics on different levels could not be compared directly. We put forward a fairer metric and give a method to convert between metrics of two levels. Secondly, drone images may be another important source, but drone data may have only a post-disaster image. This paper shows and compares methods of directly detecting and generating. Thirdly, the class imbalance is a typical feature of the xBD dataset and leads to a bad F1 score for minor damage and major damage. This paper provides four specific data resampling strategies, which are Main-Label Over-Sampling (MLOS), Discrimination After Cropping (DAC), Dilation of Area with Minority (DAM) and Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE), as well as cost-sensitive re-weighting schemes. Fourthly, faster prediction meets the need for a real-time situation. This paper recommends three specific methods, feature-map subtraction, parameter sharing, and knowledge distillation.

13522,"Ballistic projectiles are the most frequently lethal volcanic hazard close to the vent. Recent eruptions of Ontake in 2014 and Kusatsu-Shirane in 2018 showed that un-reinforced, timber-framed buildings - those typically considered highly vulnerable to the dangerous penetration of ballistics - provided life-saving shelter from ballistic impact. Modelled kinetic energies of some non-penetrating impacts were an order of magnitude above expected penetration thresholds. It has been hypothesised that a pre-existing layer of tephra on the roofs cushioned impacts. To quantitatively test this, and improve our understanding of how buildings respond to projectile impacts, we used a pneumatic cannon to simulate block impacts to clay tiles and reinforced concrete roof slabs covered with tephra layers 0-20 cm thick. Substantially higher impact energies were resisted when tephra was present with 5 cm of tephra approximately tripling the penetration threshold of both building materials. Fragility curves, which relate ballistic hazard intensity with the probability of building damage, were developed from our experimental data following three curve fitting approaches: generalised link models, cumulative link models and data binning. A key benefit of these approaches is that confidence in these curves can be robustly quantified from the data - the first time that this has been attempted for volcanic fragility curves. This study shows how the extent of building damage can be strongly influenced by the sequence of volcanic hazards and provides an example of proactive risk management through testing of physical mitigation strategies in a laboratory environment.

13523,"The ravages of time, natural and man-made disasters, pollution, fatigue, overexposure, mismanagement, and the unintended consequences of efforts to preserve our cultural patrimony, have all taken a major toll on historical structures. Structural health assessment is the first pivotal step towards creating a strategy for long-term life-cycle management. Historical structures provide an abundance of unique challenges that when combined serve as a great qualifying test for the study of as-built structures. This paper explores the diagnostic value of terrestrial laser scanning for the structural health assessment of the Baptistery di San Giovanni in Florence, Italy and proposes an integrative methodology for repeatable data acquisition, processing, visualization and analysis. The presented study proves that even under challenging circumstances, efficient documentation of entire structures is possible. The case study at the Baptistery demonstrates that even when objectives are not formed prior to the survey, comprehensive data sets of high quality and reliability will enable meaningful structural health assessments. With a reliable comprehensive baseline model in place, it can be annotated, qualitatively analyzed and recurring surveys can be conducted to track changes and damages throughout time.","Terrestrial laser scanning for the comprehensive structural health assessment of the Baptistery di San Giovanni in Florence, Italy: an integrative methodology for repeatable data acquisition, visualization and analysis",2018,Baptistery di San Giovanni; three-dimensional models; 3D model; three-dimensional analysis; structural analysis; damage assessment; remote sensing,HISTORIC BUILDINGS; IR THERMOGRAPHY; MASONRY; BRIDGE; MODEL; BIM,0,0
13525,"Reinforced concrete containment (RCC) building has long been considered as the last barrier for keeping the radiation from leaking into the environment. It is important to quantify the performance of these structures and facilities considering extreme conditions. However, the preceding research on evaluating nuclear power plant (NPP) structures, particularly considering mainshock-aftershock seismic sequences, is deficient. Therefore, this manuscript serves to investigate the seismic fragility of a typical RCC building subjected to mainshock-aftershock seismic sequences. The implementation of the fragility assessment has been performed based on the incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) method. A lumped mass RCC model considering the tri-linear skeleton curve and the maximum point-oriented hysteretic rule is employed for IDA analyses. The results indicate that the seismic capacity of the RCC building would be overestimated without taking into account the mainshock-aftershock effects. It is also found that the seismic capacity of the RCC building decreases with the increase of the relative intensity of aftershock ground motions to mainshock ground motions. In addition, the effects of artificial mainshock-aftershock ground motions generated from the repeated and randomized approaches and the polarity of the aftershock with respect to the mainshock on the evaluation of the RCC are also researched, respectively.",The capacity loss of a RCC building under mainshock-aftershock seismic sequences,2018,reinforced concrete containment building; mainshock-aftershock effects; fragility assessment; HCLPF capacity; IDA,NUCLEAR-POWER-PLANTS; PLASTIC-DAMAGE MODEL; VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; FAULT EARTHQUAKES; SAFETY EVALUATION; DUCTILITY DEMAND; RISK-ASSESSMENT; GROUND MOTIONS; GRAVITY DAMS,0,0
13526,"Floods can cause damage like slightly damaged, significantly damaged or destroyed to homes and possessions as well as disruption to communications. Inherently, victims should be given temporary or permanent houses depending on the degree of damage to their houses. Therefore, an assessment on the levels of damage must be carried out in the aftermath of a flood as a direction for recovery effort, for example housing resettlement. The fact is, in Malaysia, there is still no standardized damage assessment used by the relevant authorities in assessing the degree of housing damage after a disaster. As a result, errors in assessing the degree of housing damage and providing inaccurate type of assistance might occur. Thus, this research emphasis on the understanding the degree of house damage and recommend the significant input in developing the damage assessment model in Malaysia. To achieve the objective, this research applies a self-developed model that is derived from the literature review (framework or model of the degrees of housing damage after flood) and the observation at the case study area to see the actual conditions of the affected houses. After that, questionnaires were distributed to 50 respondents consist of engineers (n=10), architects (n=10), quantity surveyors (n=10), real estate valuers (n=10) and building surveyor (n=10) by using purposive sampling to gauge their perceptions on attributes of degree of housing damage and eventually conducting a focus group consist of ten (10) technical experts involved in MERCY Malaysia in assessing the housing damage for model validation. The findings indicate that the degree of damage can be classified as 'minor', 'major' and 'destroyed'.

13527,"A first-order approximate probabilistic analytical method to investigate the damage of concrete gravity dams, based on the pseudo-excitation method (PEM), is proposed. This method constructs stochastic stiffness under stochastic stimulus using second-order perturbation. It involves the following steps. First, the PEM and the Mazar damage models are utilised to analyse the way to calculate the expected value and variance of the damage of a dam excited by a random earthquake load and a static load in the initial condition. Next, the evolutive process of the probability distribution of the tensile damage of a dam is analysed in the damage condition based on perturbation theory. Finally, a numerical example is given to verify and analyse the convergence and stability of this model. The calculated results show that the expected values of the probability distribution of the stochastic structure under a stochastic stimulus are steady under a second-order perturbation. The results indicate that, compared to PEM, the salient features of the method proposed provide a probabilistic analysis for the nonlinear response of a concrete gravity dam. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Two FLCs are designed for controlling the actuators and controllable viscous dampers as active and semi-active devices, respectively. Fragility curves are used to show the probability of damage imposed on uncontrolled and controlled structures. They are developed in consideration with three performance levels specified in FEMA 356, including Immediate Occupancy (IO), Life Safety (LS), and Collapse Prevention (CP). Considering deterministic and probabilistic parameters for the structure, fragility curves are generated separately to investigate the effect of structural uncertainties on the damage. To simulate the structure including the probabilistic parameters, Latin hypercube sampling is employed. Effectiveness of the controllers is illustrated and verified using the simulated response of a 3-story nonlinear benchmark building excited by several ground motions. To compare the performance of fuzzy controllers, fragility curves are also generated for the structure controlled by LQG and clipped-optimal controllers. Results show that FLCs can reduce the probability of damage significantly. Moreover, it is observed that the uncertainty in mass and yield strength has the greatest effect on the maximum drift of structure. (C) 2016 Sharif University of Technology.

13530,"Tunnel form building is frequently utilised by contractors and developers in constructing high rise building due to its rapid construction process and cost-effective method. However, the capability to cater earthquake load is still questionable. In Malaysia, most of the existing buildings were constructed using BS8110 without any provision to earthquake load. Thus, it is vital to investigate the behaviour of these buildings under the influence of multi-level earthquake records.

13537,"Post-Earthquake damage assessment has always been one of the major challenges that both engineers and authorities face after disastrous earthquakes all around the world. Considering the number of buildings in need of inspection and the insufficient number of qualified inspectors, the availability of a thorough, quantitative and rapidly applicable damage assessment methodology is vitally important after such events. At the beginning of the new millennia, an assessment system satisfying these needs was developed for the Turkish Catastrophe Insurance Pool (TCIP, known as DASK in Turkey) to evaluate the damages in reinforced concrete (RC) and masonry structures. Since its enforcement, this assessment method has been successfully used after several earthquakes that took place in Turkey, such as 2011 Van Earthquake, 2011 Kutahya Earthquake, 2019 Istanbul Earthquake and 2020 Elazig Earthquake to decide the future of damaged structures to be either ‘repaired’ or ‘demolished’. Throughout the years, the number of research activities focusing on the reparability of earthquake-damaged structures has increased, which is a purposeful parameter in the determination of buildings’ future after earthquakes. Accordingly, TCIP initiated a research project with a sole aim to regulate and reevaluate the damage assessment algorithm based on the results of state-of-the-art scientific research. This chapter presents the new version of the damage assessment methodology for reinforced concrete structures which was developed for TCIP (TCIP-DAM-2020).

Earthquakes from the Aceh segment fault and the Seulimeum fault could occur with various magnitudes and times. The earthquakes could cause structural damages of buildings and injure the Kuta Alam residents. Study of damage prediction caused by earthquakes for different magnitudes and times has been conducted for the Kuta Alam sub-district by using GIS model analysis. This study aims to investigate several possible scenarios of the earthquake model and intensity map for the Kuta Alam sub-district, to determine the damage ratio of the buildings and its distribution in different earthquake scenarios and to estimate the casualty in the Kuta Alam sub-district. The shallow crustal shaking attenuation was considered in modeling the earthquake scenarios intensity map on bedrock and surface after site coefficient correction. Earthquake model in different scenarios were generated from the Aceh segment and the Seulimeum fault of the Sumatra Fault Zone. The damage ratios of various types of buildings were calculated using fragility curves. Population data of each building in different occupancy time, damage ratio, and injury ratio was used to compute the number of injuries due to a scenario earthquake. The results reveal that the Kuta Alam sub-district respond 7.3 - 9.3 MMI from 6.5 - 7.0 Mw of earthquake models from different sources. The worst event is an Mw 7.0 earthquake located along the Aceh segment which could cause damage 49% - 71% of building and injure 5.3% - 24.8% of building populations at 2 Pm (day-time) event and injure 1 - 4 people in houses at 2 Am (night-time). An Mw 6.5 earthquake along the Seulimeum fault damages 30%- 53% of buildings and injure 3.3% - 18% of population at daytime and injure 1 - 4 people in houses at the nighttime.

13540,"Enhancing the seismic performance of traditional stone masonry buildings is considered a crucial measure towards the preservation and safeguarding of our built heritage, particularly in seismic prone areas such as the Azores archipelago, in Portugal. In this context, the present paper is focused on the seismic vulnerability assessment of two traditional stone masonry building located in the Faial Island, taken as typologically representative of the rural Azorean building stock. The case study buildings were modelled based on the equivalent frame model approach and non-linear static (pushover) analyses were performed to assess their seismic performance. Firstly, results were compared in terms of capacity curves, and secondly, two different seismic performance-based assessment methods (N2 and CSM) were used to determine the respective performance points and assess the seismic safety of both structures. The seismic demand was defined by a set of real ground motion records, which the authors assumed as representative of the 1998 Azores earthquake, both in terms of magnitude and epicentral distance. Additionally, a set of traditional retrofitting solutions were implemented to the original models in order to analyse and compare their influence over the building's global seismic performance. These solutions were adopted in the aftermath of the 1980 and 1998 Azores earthquakes by different design offices and engineering consultants, based on the designing recommendations specifically prepared by the Regional Laboratory of Civil Engineering (LREC) under the scope of the Faial rehabilitation process. Finally, fragility curves were derived based on the spectral response approach, and the results were critically discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The authors have tried to present the most common empirical and analytical methodologies in a concise manner, which would motivate researchers and practicing engineers to use it as a comprehensive guide and reference for their future works.

13542,"The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 (SFDRR) represents an inclusive approach to disaster risk reduction, linked to development and recovery. Building on previous international guidelines, the SFDRR promotes practical and measurable outcomes for reducing disaster losses, including indicators to measure progress towards seven specific global targets. Evaluated in the context of the priorities and global targets of the SFDRR, the article considers the case of the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami of 2011 to illustrate advances and limitations in pre-disaster tsunami hazard engineering and post-disaster recovery. With respect to the targets set out in the Sendai Framework related to risk reduction and tsunami engineering, especially Priority 1, understanding disaster risk, there have been significant advances in hazard assessment and systems for tsunami detection and warning. Although the SFDRR emphasizes actions in the recovery phase through Priority 4, enhancing disaster preparedness with an emphasis on the concept of build back better, on its own this does not function as a clear directive for guiding recovery. However, the overall people-centered and inclusive approach of the SFDRR, as well as the global targets and several sub-priorities, can be a useful way to shape good practices in recovery and evaluate recovery progress.",The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction at Five: Lessons from the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami,2020,Build back better; Disaster recovery; Great East Japan Earthquake; Sendai Framework; Tsunami risk,DEVELOPING FRAGILITY FUNCTIONS; INDIAN-OCEAN TSUNAMI; HAZARD ASSESSMENT; DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; INDONESIA; RECOVERY,0,0
13543,"The vulnerability assessment of the building stock in a given territorial area, such as a city or an entire country, is a key prerequisite for evaluating risk, not only because of the potential physical consequences resulting from the occurrence of an event, but also because it is one of the few aspects in which engineering research can intervene. In fact, the rigorous vulnerability assessment of existing buildings followed by the implementation of appropriate retrofitting solutions can help to substantially reduce the levels of physical damage and economic impact of future events. Particularly regarding the seismic vulnerability assessment of historical centers, the amount of knowledge that has been accumulated over the past decades, together with the broad damage data obtained from post-earthquake damage surveys, provides a singular opportunity to develop and calibrate innovative large-scale seismic vulnerability assessment approaches, which can be used to outline and support risk mitigation and management strategies. This article addresses this issue by discussing the use of a large-scale seismic vulnerability assessment methodology for masonry facade walls as a tool for evaluating the potential benefit resulting from the application of different seismic retrofitting strategies, both considering their contribution to reduce post-event urban losses and accessibility.","The Use of a Large-Scale Seismic Vulnerability Assessment Approach for Masonry Facade Walls as an Effective Tool for Evaluating, Managing and Mitigating Seismic Risk in Historical Centers",2018,earthquake evacuation; historical centers; large-scale assessment; retrofitting strategies; risk mitigation; seismic vulnerability,EARTHQUAKE PEDESTRIANS EVACUATION; RETROFITTING STRATEGIES; FRAGILITY CURVES; RC BUILDINGS; DAMAGE DATA; SCENARIOS; PERFORMANCE; LAQUILA; IMPACT,0,0
13545,"Preserving architectural heritage from seismic risks is an extremely challenging task, not only because of its specific vulnerability but because of the large number of buildings involved as well. Our objective is to tackle both these aspects, using dynamical analysis and numerical modeling, which requires developing inexpensive approaches to process a large body of poorly documented buildings. We choose to develop this approach on the rich heritage of vernacular baroque churches and chapels in the highest valleys of French Savoy. This article develops three original ways we have overcome three critical steps in this prospect. First we used photogrammetry to address the lack of survey of the 200 concerned buildings. It is the base of the tool which we developed to build the meshes for finite element dynamic computations. Then in order to validate these numerical models and estimate the average mechanical characteristics of each substructure of these buildings, we proceeded to vibration measurements in 20 representative churches. The powerful validation process we propose for the dynamic identification and the update of the models allowed us to obtain information inaccessible by conventional mechanical testing due to the regulations on protected buildings and to their own variability. Finally, starting from experimental data, we used a discrete element model for extrapolating the data necessary for the implementation of a nonlinear continuous model suitable for masonry and our modeling specifications. By identifying displacement criteria, we are able to represent the damage level in the structure and then build fragility curves for 200 complex buildings. The coherence between the experimental data and numerical results validates the global proposed method and the key points highlighted here. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",Three key points for a large-scale seismic assessment of masonry architectural heritage,2016,None,Buildings; Dynamics; Historic preservation; Masonry materials; Mechanical testing; Numerical methods; Numerical models; Seismology; Vibrations (mechanical); Architectural heritage; Continuous modeling; Discrete element modeling; Dynamic computations; Dynamic identification; Dynamical analysis; Mechanical characteristics; Model specifications; Structural analysis,0,0
13546,"Nonlinear dynamic analysis techniques have made significant progress in the last 20 years, providing powerful tools for assessing structural damage and potential building collapse mechanisms. The fact that several reinforced concrete shear wall residential buildings underwent severe structural damage in walls at the lower building levels during the 2010 Maule earthquake (Chile) presents a scientific opportunity to assess the predictive quality of these techniques. The objective of this research is to compare building responses using two completely different three-dimensional nonlinear dynamic models and study in detail the observed damage pattern and wall collapse of one reinforced concrete shear wall building in Santiago, Chile. The first model is a mixed fiber-shell model developed in MATLAB, and the second is a shell finite element model developed in the software DIANA. Results of both models are consistent with the hypothesis that high axial loads trigger a limited ductility failure in critical walls at roof-to-base drift ratios less than 0.34% with little capacity of hysteretic energy dissipation, which contradicts the ductile design philosophy of current code provisions. © The Author(s) 2020.",Three-dimensional nonlinear response history analyses for earthquake damage assessment: A reinforced concrete wall building case study,2021,brittle failure; damage assessment; inelastic finite element models; Reinforced concrete; seismic behavior; shear wall building,Concrete construction; Damage detection; Ductility; Earthquakes; Energy dissipation; MATLAB; Shear walls; Structural analysis; Hysteretic energy dissipations; Non-linear dynamic analysis; Nonlinear response history analysis; Reinforced concrete shear walls; Reinforced concrete wall; Residential building; Shell finite elements; Structural damages; Reinforced concrete; building; earthquake damage; finite element method; numerical model; reinforced concrete; seismic response; three-dimensional modeling; wall; Chile; Metropolitana,0,0
13547,"Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is not new in the field of structural engineering and its application goes from the monitoring to evaluation of bridges, dams, buildings, and other similar structures. As per National Structural Code of the Philippines (NSCP) Volume 1[1-4], the Implementing Rules of earthquake recording instrumentation of buildings has been continually advancing, but not in the case of bridges and dams. The objective of this paper is to apply the established sensor-driven accelerometer developed by USHER (Universal Structural Health Evaluation and Recording) system in the evaluation of Padre Jacinto Zamora Bridge in Manila; specifically, to determine the proper installation of the developed accelerometer in the identified critical parts of the bridge. SHM addresses the problem of structural integrity assessment and help in assuring repair cost to a minimal. SHM helps quantify the strength of a structure by identifying the damage. Often evaluations are made using visual inspection and by age consideration. Most of the time, the use of this type of evaluation tend to be expensive. Repairs are not directed to the damaged component alone but the whole structure. Hence, the expenditure expands. SHM with the application of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Sensors (MEMS) will allow gathering of data that can be converted in the form of the structure's modal properties (i.e. natural frequency, mode shape, and damping ratio) [6, 7]. Structural health is then determined and be ready to compare it to the structural model simulation results. A method was developed to incorporate seismic fragility curves [5] to determine the thresholds for the evaluation of the structural health. Capacity spectrum method was utilized to derive the seismic fragility function. A Monte Carlo Simulation was used to derive the flood fragility curves. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

13548,"Tidal marshes (including saltmarshes) provide remarkable value for many social (cultural, recreational) and environmental (fish production, water quality, shoreline protection, carbon sequestration) services. However, their extent, condition, and capacity to support these services are threatened by human development expansion, invasive species, erosion, altered hydrology and connectivity, and climate change. The past two decades have seen a shift toward working with managers to restore tidal marshes to conserve existing patches or create new marshes. The present perspective examines key features of recent tidal marsh restoration projects. Although optimism about restoration is building, not all marshes are the same; site-specific nuances require careful consideration, and thus, standard restoration designs are not possible. Restoration projects are effectively experiments, requiring clear goals, monitoring and evaluation, and adaptive management practices. Restoration is expensive; however, payment schemes for ecosystem services derived from restoration offer new ways to fund projects and appropriate monitoring and evaluation programs. All information generated by restoration needs to be published and easily accessible, especially failed attempts, to equip practitioners and scientists with actionable knowledge for future efforts. We advocate the need for a network of tidal marsh scientists, managers, and practitioners to share and disseminate new observations and knowledge. Such a network will help augment our capacity to restore tidal marsh, but also valuable coastal ecosystems more broadly.",Tidal Marsh Restoration Optimism in a Changing Climate and Urbanizing Seascape,2021,Restoration challenges; Restoration knowledge; Restoration opportunities; Saltmarsh; Seascape,SALT-MARSH; ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; LIVING SHORELINES; FISH ASSEMBLAGE; OYSTER REEFS; HABITAT; IMPACT; NEKTON; PATTERNS; FUTURE,0,0
13549,"Assessing the damage to buildings from volcanic eruptions is an important aspect of volcanic risk assessment and management However, there is a limited empirical evidence base to draw upon when describing the relation between volcanic hazard intensity and resulting physical damage. The 2015 subplinian eruption of Calbuco volcano, Chile, caused damage to buildings near the volcano because of tephra fall and lahars. Chilean authorities conducted a damage assessment of 961 properties (990 buildings) to inform an assistance programme for property owners affected by the eruption. Property assessments typically contained observations and classification of damage to a house, and in some instances accessory buildings such as sheds, garages, and exterior storage rooms. In this study we used this unique damage data set to adapt damage state frameworks for tephra fall and lahar for classifying and analysing damage observations. We developed data quality indicators to provide transparency for how we accounted for data quality issues. We assigned a tephra and/or lahar damage state to 571 buildings (530 houses and 41 accessory buildings). The 419 buildings for which we did not assign a damage state either had too little information or fell outside of tephra and/or lahar hazard zones. The minimum tephra thickness isopach band that caused complete collapse was 10 to 15 cm (dry deposit loading similar to 1 to 1.6 kN m(-2), saturated deposit loading 1.6 to 2.4 kN m(-2)), but most commonly (55% of tephra exposed DS5 houses n = 11), this occurred at 15 to 30 cm (dry deposit loading-1.5 to 33 kN saturated deposit loading 2.4 to 4.8 kN m(-2)). Lahar damage was typically described as complete (DS5), with 26 houses being swept away or destroyed around the Blanco South River. Our results add to the limited evidence base of post-eruption tephra and lahar impacts to buildings and contribute to volcanic risk and impact assessment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

13550,"Diverse natural and manmade disasters are becoming more frequent inflicting severe consequences to the environment, societies, economies and critical infrastructure. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to sustain the functionality and operability of critical infrastructure during and after the hazard event, minimize the direct and indirect losses and mitigate the consequences in the aftermath of a disaster. In the last few years, the need to develop risk analysis and risk management tools was emerged, toward facilitating stakeholders’ decision-making, adaptation and preparedness against diverse hazards for enhancing the resilience of cities, infrastructure and societies. Those tools were either newly developed or built on existing loss assessment platforms. In addition to the modules and functions for loss assessments, such as hazard, fragility, damage assessment, visualization and reporting of the results, some of the tools embedded modules for recovery, decision-making and risk mitigation to facilitate resilience assessments whenever feasible. The range of modules is wide, including identification of likely failures and performance of structural and infrastructure systems, recovery of loss of functionality and preparation of recovery plans for disaster events. Thus, resilience assessment tools are becoming more sophisticated, aiming to assist engineers, decision makers and planners to perform a resilience-based design or/and assessment of individual buildings, critical infrastructure and cities, and in this way to withstand and recover from catastrophic events. In this paper, a review of on-market available tools is presented, and then developments, limitations and future needs are discussed. © 2019, National Technical University of Athens.

13553,"Remote sensing technology is useful for comprehending extensive damage caused by a tsunami disaster. In recent years, methods for detecting building damage due to tsunami disaster have been developed and the accuracies have been improved. X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides high-resolution spatial resolution which is sufficient for identifying building damage at a building unit scale. However, X-band SAR data has a disadvantage in the acquisition coverage which is smaller than that of L-band SAR data. On the other hand, to comprehend the damage of extensive tsunami affected areas, L-band SAR data which has lower spatial resolution is more effective than using X-band SAR data. To lead to an efficient emergency response or reconctuction activities after the disaster, these advantages and disadvantages are necessary to be clarifiled from the point of view of disaster management, and the appropriate method for applying the developed technologies in an efficient manner should be discussed.

13554,"Fires can cause substantial damage to structures, both non-structural and structural, with economic losses of almost 1% GDP in developed countries. Whilst design codes allow engineers to design for the primary design driver, property protection is rarely, if ever, designed for. Quantification and design around property protection has been used for some time in the seismic community, particularly the PEER framework and fragility analyses. Fragility concepts have now started to be researched predominantly for steel-composite structures, however, there has been little to no research into the quantification of property protection for concrete structures, whether in design or in post-fire assessments of fire damaged structures. This paper presents selected results from the thermal environment around, and the thermal response of, a concrete column from a large scale structural fire test conducted in Tisova, Czech Republic, inside a four-storey concrete frame building, with concrete and composite deck floors. From the results of the fire test, assessments of the fire intensity are made and used to model the potential thermal profiles within the concrete column and the implications that high temperature might have on the post-fire response of the concrete column. These thermal profiles are then used to assess the reduction of the columns cross-sectional area and are compared to a quantified damage scale for concrete columns exposed to fire. This analyses presented herein will also show that common methods of defining fire intensity through equivalent fire durations do not appropriately account for the complexities of the thermal and structural response of concrete columns exposed to a travelling fire.

13555,"The state of the art in seismic design and assessment of structures implicitly relies on structural redundancy in order to deal with the effect of the triggered sequence of aftershock events on a building. Calculating the time-dependent limit state exceedance probability for a structure considering both the main event and the triggered sequence of aftershocks is complicated both by the time-dependent rate of aftershock occurrence and also the cumulative damage caused by the sequence of events. Taking advantage of a methodology developed in previous works by the authors for postmainshock risk assessment, the limit state probability due to a sequence of a mainshock and the triggered aftershocks is calculated herein. Moreover, a closed- and analytic-form approximation to the post-mainshock limit state probability given the mainshock magnitude is derived. This closed- and analytic formulation facilitates the estimation of the limit state probability by employing the standard tools in risk assessment such as the fragility curve for the intact structure. Applying the proposed methodology for a reinforced concrete (RC) concrete moment-resisting frame with infills subjected to the main event and the triggered sequence emphasizes the importance of taking into account the cumulative damage caused by the triggered sequence for the case-study model. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the proposed analytical approximation based on the fragility curve for the intact structure leads to a surprisingly close agreement with the best-estimate results obtained by considering the time- and event-dependent degradation in the structure.",Towards quantifying the effect of aftershocks in seismic risk assessment,2015,None,Concretes; Earthquakes; Probability; Reinforced concrete; Risk perception; Seismic design; Seismology; Structural design; Analytical approximation; Cumulative damage; Exceedance probability; Moment resisting frames; Seismic risk assessment; Sequence of events; State of the art; Structural redundancy; Risk assessment,0,0

To this end, the previously considered models of hazard, exposure and vulnerability will be critically reviewed and updated by taking advantage also from the results deriving from other WPs of the DPC-ReLUIS research project. In the present paper some of the most relevant aspects that are being introduced in the development of the new Italian risk maps have been described and shortly analysed. First, a significant upgrade of the vulnerability model implemented in the new version of the platform used for risk calculation (IRMA) is proposed, where reference to the six EMS-98 classes is made also considering regional vulnerability features. Further, empirical data from observed real damage are integrated with results from numerical simulations (mechanical approach), in particular for reinforced concrete buildings.

13558,"In-plane cyclic loading of masonry walls induces a complex failure pattern composed of multiple diagonal shear cracks, as well as flexural cracks. The realistic modelling of such induced localized cracking necessitates the use of costly direct numerical simulations with detailed information on both the properties and geometry of masonry components. On the contrary, computationally efficient macro-models using standard smeared-crack approaches often result in a poor representation of fracture in the simulated material, not properly localized and biased by the finite element mesh orientation. This work proposes a possible remedy to these drawbacks of macro-models through the use of a crack-tracking algorithm. The macro-modelling approach results in an affordable computational cost, while the tracking algorithm aids the mesh-bias independent and localized representation of cracking. A novel methodology is presented that allows the simulation of intersecting and multi-directional cracks using tracking algorithms. This development extends the use of localized crack approaches using tracking algorithms to a wider field of applications exhibiting multiple, arbitrary and interacting cracking. The paper presents also a novel formulation including into an orthotropic damage model the description of irreversible deformations under shear loading. The proposed approach is calibrated through the comparison with an experimental test on a masonry shear wall against in-plane cyclic loading.",Tracking multi-directional intersecting cracks in numerical modelling of masonry shear walls under cyclic loading,2018,Continuum damage mechanics; Crack-tracking; Cyclic shear loading; Intersecting cracks; Masonry walls,LIMIT ANALYSIS; DAMAGE MODEL; CONCRETE STRUCTURES; SEISMIC ANALYSIS; MATERIAL FAILURE; HOMOGENIZATION; PERFORMANCE; BUILDINGS; ELEMENT,0,0
13559,"Reliable flood risk analyses, including the estimation of damage, are an important prerequisite for efficient risk management. However, not much is known about flood damage processes affecting companies. Thus, we conduct a flood damage assessment of companies in Germany with regard to two aspects. First, we identify relevant damage-influencing variables. Second, we assess the prediction performance of the developed damage models with respect to the gain by using an increasing amount of training data and a sector-specific evaluation of the data. Random forests are trained with data from two postevent surveys after flood events occurring in the years 2002 and 2013. For a sector-specific consideration, the data set is split into four subsets corresponding to the manufacturing, commercial, financial, and service sectors. Further, separate models are derived for three different company assets: buildings, equipment, and goods and stock. Calculated variable importance values reveal different variable sets relevant for the damage estimation, indicating significant differences in the damage process for various company sectors and assets. With an increasing number of data used to build the models, prediction errors decrease. Yet the effect is rather small and seems to saturate for a data set size of several hundred observations. In contrast, the prediction improvement achieved by a sector-specific consideration is more distinct, especially for damage to equipment and goods and stock. Consequently, sector-specific data acquisition and a consideration of sector-specific company characteristics in future flood damage assessments is expected to improve the model performance more than a mere increase in data. © 2017.

13560,"The assessment of satellite image classifications is usually carried out using a test sample assumed as the ground truth, from which a confusion matrix is derived. There are cases where the reference data, even those coming from a ground survey, are affected by errors and do not represent a reliable truth. In the field of geophysical parameter retrieval, the triple collocation (TC) technique is applied for validating remotely sensed products when the source of test data (e.g., ground data) does not represent a reliable reference. TC is able to retrieve the error variances of three systems observing the same target parameter, assuming that their errors are independent. In this paper, we exploit the same idea to test the classification accuracy in cases where the ground truth is not available. We extend the TC approach to the classification problem for a general number of classes, but we solve it numerically for a two-class problem (i.e., collapsed and noncollapsed buildings). The specific case refers to the detection of L'Aquila 2009 earthquake damage from very high-resolution optical data. The image classification, performed by exploiting an object-based analysis, is compared with those from two different ground surveys carried out after the earthquake by different teams and with different purposes. This paper demonstrates the power of the TC approach for assessing the classification accuracy with no reliable ground truth available, and provides an insight into the problem of assessing damage, from satellite and on ground, in a very critical and unsafe situation, like the one occurring after an earthquake. Moreover, it was found that the remotely sensed product can have an order of accuracy comparable to that of at least one of the ground surveys.",Triple Collocation to Assess Classification Accuracy Without a Ground Truth in Case of Earthquake Damage Assessment,2018,Classification accuracy; earthquake damage; triple collocation (TC),SOIL-MOISTURE,0,0
13561,"Probabilistic damage evaluation and loss estimation of spatially distributed infrastructure systems (e.g. an electric power system or a building portfolio) under a scenario tropical cyclone must consider the spatial correlation of cyclone wind speeds to estimate their impact on the built environment statistically. Previous studies have seldom considered the impact of this spatial correlation on damage assessments of distributed civil infrastructure. In this paper, a stochastic field model is developed to capture the uncertainty of cyclone wind speeds and their spatial correlation for the North Atlantic region. A series of recorded wind speed fields of historical cyclone events are examined. The bias values between the recorded wind speeds and computed wind speeds based on a widely used cyclonic wind field model are obtained. The statistics of the wind field bias are estimated using geostatistical tools. The effect of wind speed uncertainty and spatial correlation on performance assessment of distributed infrastructure systems is illustrated using an electric power system, where the metrics of performance are damage ratio, outage ratio and outage cost. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Tropical cyclone damage assessment of distributed infrastructure systems under spatially correlated wind speeds,2021,Community resilience; Electric power networks; Natural hazards; Probabilistic risk assessment; Statistical analysis; Structural reliability; Tropical cyclones,Electric losses; Hurricanes; Outages; Spatial distribution; Speed; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Storms; Tropics; Wind; Civil infrastructures; Distributed infrastructure; Geostatistical tools; Metrics of performance; Performance assessment; Probabilistic damage; Spatial correlations; Stochastic field modeling; Damage detection,0,0
13563,"Modern tsunami events have highlighted the vulnerability of port structures to these high-impact but infrequent occurrences. However, port planning rarely includes adaptation measures to address tsunami hazards. The 2011 Tohoku tsunami presented us with an opportunity to characterise the vulnerability of port industries to tsunami impacts. Here, we provide a spatial assessment and photographic interpretation of freely available data sources. Approximately 5000 port structures were assessed for damage and stored in a database. Using the newly developed damage database, tsunami damage is quantified statistically for the first time, through the development of damage fragility functions for eight common port industries. In contrast to tsunami damage fragility functions produced for buildings from an existing damage database, our fragility functions showed higher prediction accuracies (up to 75% accuracy). Pre-tsunami earthquake damage was also assessed in this study and was found to influence overall damage assessment. The damage database and fragility functions for port industries can inform structural improvements and mitigation plans for ports against future events. © Copyright:",Tsunami damage to ports: Cataloguing damage to create fragility functions from the 2011 Tohoku event,2021,None,earthquake event; photography; port; risk assessment; Tohoku earthquake 2011; tsunami event; Japan,0,0
13566,"Rapidly and accurately obtaining collapsed building information for earthquake-stricken areas can help to effectively guide the implementation of the emergency response and can reduce disaster losses and casualties. This work is focused on rapid building earthquake damage detection in urban areas using a single post-earthquake polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image. In an earthquake-stricken area, the buildings include both damaged buildings and undamaged buildings. The undamaged buildings are made up of both parallel buildings, whose array direction is parallel to the flight direction, and oriented buildings, whose array direction is not parallel to the flight direction. The damaged buildings after an earthquake are made up of completely collapsed buildings and residual damaged parallel walls and oriented walls of the damaged buildings. Therefore, we divide the buildings in earthquake-stricken areas into five kinds: intact parallel buildings, damaged parallel walls, collapsed buildings, intact oriented buildings, and damaged oriented walls. The two new polarimetric feature parameters of _H and H_ are proposed to recognize the five kinds of buildings, and the Wishart supervised classification method is employed to further improve the extraction accuracy of the damaged buildings and undamaged buildings.",Two New Polarimetric Feature Parameters for the Recognition of the Different Kinds of Buildings in Earthquake-Stricken Areas Based on Entropy and Eigenvalues of PolSAR Decomposition,2018,earthquake; PolSAR; collapsed buildings; damaged walls; polarimetric features,DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; SCATTERING MODEL; SAR IMAGERY; CLASSIFICATION,0,0
13567,"Background: Seismic risk mitigation has become a crucial issue due to the great number of casualties and large economic losses registered after recent earthquakes. In particular, unreinforced masonry constructions built before modern seismic codes, common in Italy and in other seismic-prone areas, are characterized by great vulnerability. In order to implement mitigation policies, analytical tools are necessary to generate scenario simulations. Methods: Therefore, data collected during inspections after the 2009 L’Aquila, Italy earthquake are used to derive novel fragility functions. Compared to previous studies, data are interpreted accounting for the presence of buildings not inspected due to those being undamaged. An innovative building damage state is proposed and is based on the response of different structural elements recorded in the survey form: vertical structures, horizontal structures, stairs, roof, and partition walls. In the suggested formulation, the combination of their performance is weighted based on typical reparation techniques and on the relative size of the structural elements, estimated from a database of complete geometrical surveys developed specifically for this study. Moreover, the proposed building damage state estimates earthquake-related damage by removing the preexisting damage reported in the inspection form. Results: Lognormal fragility curves, in terms of building damage state grade as a function of typological classes and peak ground acceleration, derived maximizing their likelihood and their merits compared with previous studies are highlighted. Conclusion: The correction of the database to account for uninspected buildings delivers curves that are less “stiff” and reach the median for lower peak ground acceleration values. The building feature that influences most the fragility is the masonry quality. © 2021 Zucconi et al.","Typological damage fragility curves for unreinforced masonry buildings affected by the 2009 l'aquila, italy earthquake",2021,Damage state; Earthquake; Geometrical survey database; Maximum likelihood estimation; Simulation of uninspected buildings; Typological classes,None,0,0
13568,"Last years the role of Unmanned Aerial Systems is increasing in a wide variety of scientific aspects that need fast and reliable geodata. Nowadays, the effectiveness of the quality and the resolution that the UAS provide in spatial data acquisition are fulfilling scientific standards. Thus, UAS have a prominent role in post-earthquake damage assessment as they are capable of collecting high in resolution data for mapping spatiotemporal phenomena. The implementation of very detailed 3D Geovisualization requires oblique photos of the building faces. Thus, the UAS's data acquisition of nadir photos solely, is limited as it lacks crucial information for buildings facades.

13569,"Seismic assessments of historical masonry buildings are affected by several sources of epistemic uncertainty. These are mainly the material and the modelling parameters and the displacement capacity of the elements. Additional sources of uncertainty lie in the non-linear connections, such as wall-to-wall and floor-to-wall connections. Latin Hypercube Sampling was performed to create 400 sets of 11 material and modelling parameters. The proposed approach is applied to historical stone masonry buildings with timber floors, which are modelled by an equivalent frame approach using a newly developed macroelement accounting for both in-plane and out-of-plane failure. Each building is modelled first with out-of-plane behaviour enabled and non-linear connections, and then with out-of-plane behaviour disabled and rigid connections. For each model and set of parameters, incremental dynamic analyses are performed until building failure and seismic fragility curves derived. The key material and modelling parameters influencing the performance of the buildings are determined based on the peak ground acceleration at failure, type of failure and failure location. This study finds that the predicted PGA at failure and the failure mode and location is as sensitive to the properties of the non-linear connections as to the material and displacement capacity parameters, indicating that analyses must account for this uncertainty to accurately assess the in-plane and outof-plane failure modes of historical masonry buildings. It also shows that modelling the out-of-plane behaviour produces a significant impact on the seismic fragility curves. © 2021 by the authors.

13570,"Seismic fragility analysis is one of the main steps of consequence based earthquake engineering process. Accurate uncertainties modeling involved in this methodology, affects the final results of seismic fragility analysis and hence assessment of decision variables which are the final products of performance-based seismic analysis. One aspect of such efforts is to incorporate the sources of uncertainties associated with various factors controlling seismic loads on the buildings as well as structural responses to such excitations. Probabilistic approach is usually used to model quantitative sources of such uncertainties, however, there are other factors with descriptive nature which probabilistic approach may not well incorporate them. In this paper a fuzzy randomness approach is used to model epistemic uncertainties as an alternative to the conventional probabilistic method. The approach is used to model those uncertainties which have not been addressed by the others, in particular the definition of the collapse limit state. To illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach, fragility curves for a sample moment-resisting steel frame are developed. The results demonstrate the superiority of fuzzy solution in comparison with excising probabilistic methods to incorporate epistemic uncertainty in view of much less computational effort. © 2015 Sharif University of Technology.

13571,"This study presents a rigorous computational framework for visualizing uncertainty of tsunami hazard and risk assessment. The methodology consists of three modules: (i) earthquake source characterization and stochastic simulation of slip distribution, (ii) tsunami propagation and inundation, and (iii) tsunami damage assessment and loss estimation. It takes into account numerous stochastic tsunami scenarios to evaluate the uncertainty propagation of earthquake source characteristics in probabilistic tsunami risk analysis. An extensive Monte Carlo tsunami inundation simulation is implemented for the 2011 Tohoku tsunami (focusing upon on Rikuzentakata along the Tohoku coast of Japan) using 726 stochastic slip models derived from eleven inverted source models. By integrating the tsunami hazard results with empirical tsunami fragility functions, probabilistic tsunami risk analysis and loss estimation are carried out; outputs from the analyses are displayed using various visualization methods. The developed framework is comprehensive, and can provide valuable insights in promoting proactive tsunami risk management and in improving emergency response capability.",Uncertainty modeling and visualization for tsunami hazard and risk mapping: a case study for the 2011 Tohoku earthquake,2016,Tsunami; Stochastic source modeling; Hazard/risk maps; Uncertainty; Visualization,FRAGILITY CURVES; BUILDING DAMAGE; SLIP; INUNDATION; RUPTURE; DEFORMATION; COMPLEXITY; INDONESIA; SPACE; OCEAN,0,0
13572,"Piping systems of energy industries in oil & gas play a critical role in meeting the increasing global energy demand. A great portion of these pipelines is located in high seismic-prone areas. Such systems have been found to be quite vulnerable to seismic events. Current seismic design approaches to piping systems are mainly based on the allowable stress method, even though more modern design methods are currently available for buildings or nuclear power plants; for example, the Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering (PBEE) framework has not been applied yet to piping systems and relevant structures. In this respect, both information about the quantification of limit states for pipes and adequate non-linear structural models for seismic analysis of piping systems and relevant structures are very limited. One of the key ingredients of PBEE approach for the assessment of the seismic vulnerability of existing structures is the evaluation of fragility curves, namely the probability of exceeding a certain level of damage for a given seismic intensity measure (IM). However, the contributions in the literature on this delicate aspect are very limited. This paper deals with such a problem by using a very popular method, namely the Cloud Analysis, originally developed as a method for probabilistic seismic demand analysis of civil structures. This method is here applied to a typical piping system for process plants. For this purpose, the structure is properly modelled, especially support structure and pipe, including pipe fittings like elbows and bolted flange joints. Using natural accelerograms selected from the PEER database and in accordance with given hazard conditions, the probabilistic seismic demand analysis is performed adopting different engineering demand parameters (EDP) consistent with the damage states expected in the pipes and fittings and in the support structure. According to the results of experimental tests campaign performed in the past by some of the authors on flanged joints, and elbows, different damage states (leakage, yielding, rupture) have been identified and related to the corresponding EDP and the corresponding probability of exceeding has been determined by assuming a lognormal distribution of the response. The analysis intends to recognise the most probable damage condition in a refinery piping system subjected to a seismic input.

13573,"This paper presents a study of the damage pattern caused by a severe storm consisting of a downburst, a type of gustnado, and a tornado on Bell Ville, Argentina. Two damage surveys were conducted, one involving around 4000 questionnaires, which afforded both quantitative and qualitative insights about the damage on infrastructure, building components, and trees. Key findings include the identification of the most vulnerable urban elements which represented a significant portion of overall damage. Damage interdependencies among urban elements were also identified. The findings gained in this study help to characterize the vulnerability of this and similar cities for the most frequent intensity of downbursts, and along with some general recommendations which are also presented, they can inform local building codes, land-use regulations, and community development ordinances for cities facing this type of hazard in order to increase resilience. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Urban downburst vulnerability and damage assessment from a case study in Argentina,2016,Downburst; Gustnado; Microburst; Resilience; Tornado; Vulnerability,gust; severe weather; storm damage; tornado; urban area; vulnerability; Argentina,0,0
13574,"Regional seismic loss assessment of buildings requires ground-motion intensity measure (IM) maps. In this article, a new method to estimate the seismic structural losses of urban regions is developed. Unlike the IMs commonly predicted by ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs), this method focuses on generating IM maps based on ground-motion simulation, site-response analysis, and geostatistical approaches. The seismic structural loss estimates are conducted for the building inventory of Singapore under a deterministic Sumatran earthquake scenario with moment magnitude (Mw) 7.7. Based on the collected soil profiles in Singapore, site-response analyses are performed using the simulated bedrock motions. Kriging techniques are utilized to produce surface ground-motion intensity maps. The structural losses are then estimated using the simulated intensity maps, and the capacity and fragility curves provided in Hazards U.S. Multi-Hazard (HAZUS-MH). The estimated structural losses by this simulation-based method are compared systematically with those obtained by the GMPE-based loss estimation method. The influence of the spatial variability of IMs on seismic loss estimates is also discussed. The simulationbased approach can account better for small-scale variability of site conditions. It is applicable to urban regions where adequate attention should be paid to site effects. © 2017, Seismological Society of America.

In particular, a primary importance is given to the damage and usability assessment of public buildings, which is crucial for a quick recovery of the social activity. A significant contribution in the usability evaluation of such buildings (i.e. schools, hospitals, strategic infrastructures and historical and monumental heritage buildings) and churches was given by the ReLUIS - Laboratories University Network of seismic engineering - consortium, a competence centre of the Civil Protection Department, in the post-earthquake emergency phase of the recent central Italy earthquake. The in-situ surveys were carried out by teams of surveyors made up of experts from a list of ReLUIS researchers mobilized in accordance with emergency procedures in case of earthquake. The seismic sequence involved four significant events: M6.0 August 24, M5.9 October 26, M6.5 October 30, and M 5.5 January 18; thus several inspections were also repeated in order to evaluate the cumulative effects of seismic actions on the damage to constructions.

The program was implemented with financial support from USAID/OFDA. The targeted beneficiaries include an estimated 470,000 residents of San José. The goal of PREPARE is to provide national and municipal DRR institutions with a clearer picture of the probable impact of an earthquake, and to assist them to meet their goals to reduce fatalities and lessen the social and economic impact of future earthquakes. In the Phase I component, seismic risk assessment for the built environment was conducted. This program used the OpenQuake platform from the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) to estimate the expected values of number of fatalities, injuries, structural damage, post-earthquake building tag distribution, and debris volume for a (500-year) earthquake scenario. As part of this phase, rigorous data collection was undertaken to classify the building types and distribution of buildings in the target area. The data collection, performed electronically, employed the FEMA 154 type methodology (i.e., rapid visual survey to identify various building characteristics such as structural type, material, configuration, soil, etc.), and accounted for the local construction. Monte Carlo simulations with 10,000 realizations were conducted and the data was aggregated to compute the seismic risk for the city and to identify the zones most vulnerable to the earthquakes due to large pool of weak buildings, high seismicity, large population, or a combination of factors. Analysis showed that high fatality rates (order of 1%), large percentage of damaged buildings (6% tagged yellow or red) and high ratio of physical damage (over 40%) would be expected. The results from this phase is being utilized to develop a post-earthquake damage assessment program, allocate resources for risk reduction and developing a risk management plan with the goal of developing more resilient cities. © 2018 All rights reserved.",Usaid/ofda prepare program for Costa Rica,2018,None,Buildings; Damage detection; Data acquisition; Earthquake engineering; Emergency services; Engineering geology; Human resource management; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Population statistics; Risk assessment; Risk management; Structural analysis; Building characteristics; Disaster risk reductions; Earthquake damages; Earthquake modeling; Earthquake scenario; Risk management plans; Seismic risk assessment; Social and economic impacts; Earthquakes,0,0
13577,"The impact by debris can result in extensive damage to building facades and roof coverings in extreme climate conditions such as windstorms and hailstorms. Damage can be in the form of denting on the surface of a metal cladding panel, which is controlled by the amount of force developed at the point of contact between the debris object and the surface of the panel. Amid the lack of guidelines for assessing damage to the building envelope, it is common to conduct impact tests on a cladding specimen. Such tests often involve the use of a gas gun to fire projectiles; however, there are shortcomings with this approach as it is mostly undertaken to check compliance and to observe permanent damage to the specimen. This paper presents the use of quasi-static tests to simulate the impact induced damage to metal cladding in storm scenarios. The contact force value generated during the impact action is predicted using the two-degree-of-freedom system model so that the impact action can be applied in a quasi-static manner on an MTS machine to predict damage in the form of indentation or perforation. This experimental technique for predicting damage is illustrated and verified in this paper by conducting confirmatory impact experiments. The risk of damage to metal cladding caused by impact in storm scenarios could then be assessed with confidence without having to conduct repetitive impact testing involving accelerating projectiles onto specimens of metal cladding. This research provides designers with an accurate and cost effective means of quantifying impact induced damage on building facades, and allows system developers to adapt and utilise existing and new materials to develop innovative solutions for withstanding impact.",Use of static tests for predicting damage to cladding panels caused by storm debris,2017,Windstorms; Quasi-static; Designers; Cladding,BUILDING ENVELOPE; FRAGILITY CURVES; IMPACT; SUBJECT,0,0
13578,"This article, first, discusses the decision-making process, typically used by trained engineers to assess failure modes of masonry buildings, and then, presents the rule-based model, required to build a knowledge-based system for post-earthquake damage assessment. The acquisition of the engineering knowledge and implementation of the rule-based model lead to the developments of the knowledge-based system LOG-IDEAH (Logic trees for Identification of Damage due to Earthquakes for Architectural Heritage), a web-based tool, which assesses failure modes of masonry buildings by interpreting both crack pattern and damage severity, recorded on site by visual inspection. Assuming that failure modes detected by trained engineers for a sample of buildings are the correct ones, these are used to validate the predictions made by LOG-IDEAH. Prediction robustness of the proposed system is carried out by computing Precision and Recall measures for failure modes, predicted for a set of buildings selected in the city center of L'Aquila (Italy), damaged by an earthquake in 2009. To provide an independent meaning of verification for LOG-IDEAH, random generations of outputs are created to obtain baselines of failure modes for the same case study. For the baseline output to be compatible and consistent with the observations on site, failure modes are randomly generated with the same probability of occurrence as observed for the building samples inspected in the city center of L'Aquila. The comparison between Precision and Recall measures, calculated on the output, provided by LOG-IDEAH and predicted by random generations, underlines that the proposed knowledge-based system has a high ability to predict failure modes of masonry buildings, and has the potential to support surveyors in post-earthquake assessments. © Copyright © 2019 Novelli and D'Ayala.","Use of the Knowledge-Based System LOG-IDEAH to Assess Failure Modes of Masonry Buildings, Damaged by L'Aquila Earthquake in 2009",2019,failure modes; knowledge-based system; masonry buildings; post-earthquake assessment; seismic damage,None,0,0

We describe significant advancements to the ShakeCast software and the increasing creativity of our users and the range of their applications. In 2018 version 4 of ShakeCast is scheduled for release as part of ongoing ShakeCast research and development and includes an extensive rewrite of the entire ShakeCast application.

13581,"The considerable increase in flood damages in Europe in recent decades has shifted attention from flood protection to flood risk management. Assessments of expected damage provide critical information for flood risk management efforts. The evaluation of potential damages under different flood scenarios through quantification of their ability to provide relative short-, medium- and long-term risk reduction, supports decision-makers in discriminating among several alternative mitigation actions. End-users should be aware of, and knowledgeable about, the limitations and uncertainties of such analyses, as well-informed decisions regarding efficient and sustainable flood risk management will become increasingly relevant under future climate and socio-economic changes. In this context, a method was developed to identify and quantify the role of the input parameters in the uncertainty of the potential flood economic damage assessment in urban areas with low sloping/flat terrain and complex topography using a GIS-based, free and open-source software called Floodrisk. Sets of plausible input parameters for the model's two flood loss modelling subroutines (hydraulic modelling and damage estimation) were dynamically combined to quantify the contribution of their inner parameters to the total damage assessment uncertainty. To estimate the contributions of each input to overall model uncertainty, the combination of input parameters that minimized the error in the spatial distribution assessment of the extensive damages affecting (downtown) Albenga (Italy), enumerated after the historical Centa River flood of November 5, 1994, was taken as a reference. In this specific case, a high epistemic uncertainty for the damage estimation module was noted for the specific type and form of the damage functions used. In the absence of region-specific depth-damage functions, the vulnerability curves were adapted from a range of geographic and socio-economic studies. Given the strong dependence of model uncertainty and sensitivity to local characteristics, the epistemic uncertainty associated with the risk estimate was reduced by introducing additional information into the risk analysis. Implementing newly developed site-specific curves and a more detailed classification of the construction typology of the buildings at risk, led to a substantial decrease in modelling uncertainty, along with a decrease in the sensitivity of the flood loss estimation to the uncertainty in the depth-damage function input parameter. These findings indicated the need to produce and openly disseminate data in order to develop micro-scale risk analysis through site-specific vulnerability curves. Moreover, this study highlighted the urgent need for research on the development and implementation of methods and models for the assimilation of uncertainties in decision-making processes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Using FloodRisk GIS freeware for uncertainty analysis of direct economic flood damages in Italy,2018,Depth-dammage curves; Economic damages; Flood risk; GIS; Italy; Uncertainty analysis,damage; decision making; flood control; GIS; hazard management; risk assessment; uncertainty analysis; urban area; Italy,0,0

13583,"Problem, research strategy, and findings: U.S. communities rarely plan for recovery after a disaster, but planners have the skills to help communities redevelop, particularly in rebuilding housing, a key to community recovery. Planners, however, need appropriate and timely data on initial damage and rebuilding over time to apply for available funding, determine needs for temporary housing, address equity issues, develop appropriate policy interventions, track progress, and communicate transparently with all stakeholders. There is no accepted cost-effective and systematic method of providing those data. We developed a scalable method in which we photograph and assess the extent of home damage and rebuilding by reorienting existing damage assessment methods to provide data that can be linked to GIS and other local data to meet planning needs. We test the utility of our approach in West (TX), the site of a catastrophic fertilizer facility explosion in 2013. We compare our damage assessments to county property tax reappraisals after the disaster, finding that our approach is more accurate, generally identifying less damage and greater rebuilding than the county assumed. We conclude that our method improves on windshield surveys and other suggested methods of collecting damage and rebuilding data; it can provide efficient assessments of damage and rebuilding in technological disasters.Takeaway for practice: We created a simple and cost-effective method of assessing initial damage to homes after a disaster and of measuring the extent of rebuilding.

13584,"Heritage sites are vulnerable to damage due to social, anthropological and environmental factors. Major Earthquakes are followed by damage to cultural heritage buildings. The assessment of such building damage is a critical problem. Earth Observation data, owing to its property of being non-contact, cost effective, synoptic view and high repeatability, has a significant role to play in estimation of damage in the earthquake affected areas. Currently, several and varied types of remote sensing data have become available, and therefore, appropriate methods for rapid assessment and analysis of the data need to be developed. Rapid damage assessment is critical to minimize loss in terms of life and property. In case of cultural monuments, rapid assessment can minimize damage and help in the conservation of monument. This research focuses on evolving a robust method for rapid identification and extraction of damaged heritage building structures, especially those affected by disasters such as earthquakes. In this study, we propose to examine the utility of advance texture algorithms such as Gabor, fractal and semi-variogram for rapid damage detection in heritage building structures. The methodology attempts to automatically highlight damaged portions of the structure through a knowledge driven rule set. The technique was able to extract the damaged area from the heritage building structure with the use of high-resolution space borne data. It is observed that feature extraction algorithms based on fractal and variogram provide better results than the Gabor based textures and are very useful in the case of high-resolution satellite imagery. Both the methods are able to extract damaged features in both shadowed and non-shadowed regions of the image. Hence the problems posed by shadowed dead grounds on EO data can be effectively resolved. However, it is also observed that the advance texture feature extraction algorithms are useful only in case of high-spatial resolution dataset and has limited use for rapid damage assessment from medium and low resolution datasets. © 2020, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.","Utilizing Advance Texture Features for Rapid Damage Detection of Built Heritage Using High-Resolution Space Borne Data: A Case Study of UNESCO Heritage Site at Bagan, Myanmar",2020,Built heritage; Damage detection; Fractal feature; Gabor feature; Semi-variogram feature; Texture features,anthropogenic effect; cultural heritage; damage; detection method; earthquake damage; heritage conservation; remote sensing; satellite data; texture; UNESCO; World Heritage Site; Myanmar,0,0
13585,"The seismic assessment of cantilever elements in masonry structures is a relevant topic because of their high vulnerability and since they often involve artistic assets (such as bell-gables, parapets or pinnacles). Due to the complexity of nonlinear dynamics of cantilever systems, displacement-based assessment (DBA) procedures have been developed with the main advantage to be less demanding and, therefore, engineering practice-oriented. Various international codes already adopt these procedures but with different choices in their implementation, e.g. in the idealisation of the single degree of freedom or the method to assess the seismic displacement demand. However, despite their widespread use, a systematic validation and comparison among them is not available yet. The aim of this paper is to assess the reliability of five DBA methods available in literature and codes. To this aim, three cantilever elements with a different slenderness were analysed, both considered as laying on the ground floor or atop a supporting structure. Then, incremental dynamic analyses (IDA) have been performed by using several recorded time histories and the results were considered as the reference solution to be compared with the ones obtained by applying the examined DBA procedures. In particular, the results were processed in terms of the peak ground acceleration (PGA) alternatively leading to the attainment of the ultimate limit condition assumed by the codes or to the block overturning. The IDA clearly highlighted that the displacement demand is very sensitive to the intrinsic features of each record. The comparison in terms of fragility curves allowed evaluating robustness, reliability and safety margins of the static displacement-based previsions. Despite the complexity of the problem, the results showed that, as long as proper definitions of the ultimate displacement capacity and proper assumptions for evaluating the seismic displacement demand are adopted, the DBA approach provides safe and reliable estimates.",Validation of displacement-based procedures for rocking assessment of cantilever masonry elements,2021,Cantilever elements; Masonry; Displacement-based assessment; Rocking; Fragility curves,SEISMIC ANALYSIS; RIGID BLOCKS; DYNAMIC-RESPONSE; WALLS; CAPACITY; SPECTRUM; CRITERIA; MOTION; BODIES; DAMAGE,0,0
13586,"In order to study the vibration characteristics of reinforced concrete (RC) structures during fire and to develop the method of damage assessment after fire, 4 simply-supported RC beams (L1~L4) were designed. Firstly, the finite element model of the simply-supported beams (L1~L4) were calibrated by picking up the modal information before exposure to fire. Then fire tests were conducted on L1~L4 for 60min, 90min, 120min and 150min respectively. During the fires, the structural modal information were collected, and the attenuation formula of frequency was obtained by fitting the test results. In order to study the residual stiffness and bearing capacity of L1~L4 after the fire, the dynamic tests and bearing capacity tests were carried out. Finally, based on the modal information of specimens after the fire, by taking equivalent explosion time as the damage index, the support vector machine intelligent algorithm was used to predict the damage degree of the RC beams. Based on the Standard for Appraisal of Building Structure After Exposure to Fire (CECS252-2009), a comprehensive grading of damage index for simply-supported RC beams exposure to fire was established, and the damage index grading of L1~L4 were evaluated at the end. © 2018, Editorial Department of Advanced Engineering Sciences.

13587,"The objective of this study was to develop a technique for vibration-based damage detection through data reduction and a visualization technique known as Sammon mapping, which directly uses sensing signals. Based on the instrumented accelerometer, damage assessment of the structure is done using either ambient vibration or seismic response for centralized and sensor-level data analyses in the time or frequency domain. For the centralized data analysis, the embedded data matrix [X]m × n was constructed, with m as the number of sensing nodes and n as the number for discrete Fourier amplitude/time series data. Incorporated with the principal component analysis, data compression and pattern recognition were used for damage detection and localization. First, the matrix of mutual distances of data sets from each sensing node on the high-dimensional space was calculated. The two-dimensional space was then generated to create a Sammon mapping configuration. Damage detection and localization could be evaluated through the change in two-dimensional visualization on a Sammon map between different damage states. The proposed two-dimensional visualization technique, which uses multivariate signal-processing algorithms to identify structural damage, was verified using experimental test data of two different damage types of structures (damages occurring either in lower modes or in non-linearity). Using the proposed technique and based on the building’s seismic response data, we can systematically detect the damage occurrence (Level 1 damage detection) and localization (Level 2 damage detection). © The Author(s) 2018.",Vibration-based damage assessment of structures using signal decomposition and two-dimensional visualization techniques,2019,damage localization; principal component analysis; Sammon map; Vibration-based damage detection,Abutments (bridge); Data visualization; Fourier series; Frequency domain analysis; Mapping; Matrix algebra; Pattern recognition; Principal component analysis; Seismic response; Signal processing; Structural analysis; Vibration analysis; Visualization; Damage localization; Detection and localization; High dimensional spaces; Multivariate signal processing; Two dimensional spaces; Vibration-based damage; Vibration-based damage detection; Visualization technique; Damage detection,0,0

In Cyprus, after a series of earthquakes that occurred between 1995 and 1999, it was decided to carry out an unprecedented internationally seismic retrofitting of all school buildings, taking into account the sensitivity of the society towards these structures. In this paper representative school buildings are analysed in both their pristine condition and after applying retrofitting schemes typical of those implemented in the aforementioned large-scale strengthening programme. Non-linear analysis is conducted on calibrated analytical models of the selected buildings and fragility curves are derived for typical reinforced concrete and unreinforced masonry structures. These curves are then used to carry out a feasibility study, including both benefit-cost and life-cycle analysis, and evaluate the effectiveness of the strengthening programme.",Vulnerability assessment and feasibility analysis of seismic strengthening of school buildings,2015,School buildings; Seismic vulnerability assessment; Non-linear dynamic analysis; Cost-benefit analysis; Life-cycle cost analysis,COST DESIGN CRITERIA; BENEFIT; METHODOLOGY; BRIDGES,0,0
13591,"Recent earthquakes around the world and in Italy showed the seismic vulnerability of the existing building stock. This evidence stresses the need to develop accurate seismic fragili-ty tools, to be applied at territorial scale. Herein, seismic vulnerability curves for existing masonry buildings are developed, based on damage assessment carried out through visual survey and the Copernicus damage maps using EMS-98 damage scale. The observed dam-age dataset consists of damages occurred due to the 24th August 2016 Amatrice earthquake. The study focuses on seven towns close to the epicentre of Amatrice earthquake. The masonry building stock consists of selected buildings belonging to these towns. Ac-celero-metric registrations for the considered earthquake are used to update the GMPE pre-dictions. The resulting ground shaking fields have been modified through application of explicit stratigraphic and topographic factors. It has been confirmed that explicit consider-ation of local site effects can significantly affect the seismic vulnerability evaluations. © 2019 Associazione Geotecnica Italiana, Rome, Italy.",Vulnerability assessment for masonry buildings based on observed damage from the 2016 Amatrice earthquake,2019,None,Buildings; Damage detection; Geotechnical engineering; Masonry construction; Masonry materials; Stratigraphy; Building stocks; Damage assessments; Ground-shaking; Local sites; Masonry building; Seismic vulnerability; Seismic vulnerability curves; Vulnerability assessments; Earthquakes,0,0
13592,"Strong aftershocks have the potential to further aggravate the damage state of structures, and much less attention has been given to the seismic vulnerability of high-rise buildings than that of low- to medium-rise buildings. This study assesses the seismic vulnerability of a 32-storey frame-core tube building by performing the incremental dynamic analysis on the material-based three-dimensional numerical model. A storey damage model based on the material damage is developed using the weighted average method. Eighteen recorded mainshock-aftershock sequences, whose mainshock records match the target spectrum, are selected. The results indicate that the developed stroey damage model can effectively reflect the additional damage induced by aftershocks. Strong aftershocks have high potential to change the location of weak storeys. Notably, shifts of weak storeys are observed in more than 30% of aftershocks with relative spectral acceleration of 0.8. As the mainshock-induced damage state becomes more severe, the mainshock-damaged building becomes increasingly fragile to the aftershock excitation and more sensitive to aftershock intensities. The probability of exceeding severe damage state increases from 35.3% to 62.1% due to the effects of strong aftershocks. The results in this study can provide supports to the seismic resilience assessment of this high-rise building.",Vulnerability assessment of a high-rise building subjected to mainshock-aftershock sequences,2020,aftershock; damage model; high-rise building; resilience; vulnerability; weak storey,STRENGTH REDUCTION FACTOR; PLASTIC-DAMAGE MODEL; GROUND MOTIONS; EARTHQUAKE; SPECTRA; FRAMES,0,0

13594,"Severe earthquakes are considered as a major hazard with a potential to cause substantial physical losses, economic losses and casualties. At the same time due to population inversion, new settlements are compelled to find their space in higher earthquake-prone zones. The probability of such terrible earthquake events cannot be ruled out for the near future. It is, therefore, quantifying risk and developing strategies which are vital for the disaster mitigation. In this study, a general procedure of seismic vulnerability assessment based on the fragility function is presented. The fragility function corresponding to seismic performance of reinforced concrete frame is obtained and presented as tool for vulnerability assessment.

13595,"The launch of the medium resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 constellation in 2014 has allowed public and private organizations to introduce SAR interferometry (InSAR) products as a valuable option in their monitoring systems. The massive stacks of displacement data resulting from the processing of large C-B and radar images can be used to highlight temporal and spatial deformation anomalies, and their detailed analysis and postprocessing to generate operative products for final users. In this work, the wide-area mapping capability of Sentinel-1 was used in synergy with the COSMO-SkyMed high resolution SAR data to characterize ground subsidence affecting the urban fabric of the city of Pistoia (Tuscany Region, central Italy). Line of sight velocities were decomposed on vertical and E-W components, observing slight horizontal movements towards the center of the subsidence area. Vertical displacements and damage field surveys allowed for the calculation of the probability of damage depending on the displacement velocity by means of fragility curves. Finally, these data were translated to damage probability and potential loss maps. These products are useful for urban planning and geohazard management, focusing on the identification of the most hazardous areas on which to concentrate efforts and resources.",Vulnerability Assessment of Buildings due to Land Subsidence Using InSAR Data in the Ancient Historical City of Pistoia (Italy),2020,Sentinel-1; COSMO-SkyMed; Pistoia; land subsidence; vulnerability; fragility curves,QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT; PERMANENT SCATTERERS; GROUND SUBSIDENCE; FRAGILITY CURVES; ADVANCED DINSAR; LANDSLIDE; SCALE; COMBINATION; EVOLUTION; MONITOR,0,0
13596,"While liquefaction has been widely recognized as being one of the principal earthquake hazards resulting to significant economic and societal losses, research in the vulnerability assessment and quantitative evaluation of the expected physical damages to building structures is rather limited. In this respect, this study aims at the vulnerability assessment of typical low-code reinforced concrete (RC) frame buildings of various heights with shallow flexible foundations subjected to differential permanent displacements due to liquefaction. Nonlinear static analyses are carried out for each considered structural typology assuming different gradually increasing differential displacement patterns applied as quasi-static loads directly at its supports (footings). Different damage mechanisms are examined including a flexural damage of the building members and a shear failure of the columns. The proposed methodology results to the development of lognormally distributed fragility curves for different structural damage states as a function of the liquefaction induced differential displacements. It is shown that the height of the structure as well as the existence or not of a horizontal component of the differential displacements represent key factors affecting the vulnerability assessment. Vulnerability curves are also constructed to assess the expected direct losses in normalised cost terms. The whole approach is illustrated through a specific example. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Vulnerability assessment of low-code reinforced concrete frame buildings subjected to liquefaction-induced differential displacements,2018,Damage index; Fragility curves; Liquefaction-induced differential displacements; Nonlinear static analysis; Reinforced concrete buildings,Concrete buildings; Failure (mechanical); Liquefaction; Reinforced concrete; Static analysis; Structural analysis; Damage index; Differential displacements; Fragility curves; Non-linear static analysis; Quantitative evaluation; Reinforced concrete frame buildings; Reinforced concrete frames; Vulnerability assessments; Damage detection; assessment method; damage mechanics; displacement; induced response; liquefaction; reinforced concrete; seismic hazard; static response; structural component; vulnerability,0,0
13597,"Existing heritage structures are frequently composed of diverse masonry typologies, corresponding either to various structural members (e.g. arches, walls, piers) or to additions constructed in different eras. The identification of the material properties of the different masonry typologies is usually demanding due to the high cost of the necessary specialized in-situ experimental testing procedures and to the restrictions posed by the cultural value of historical buildings. This lack of information underlines the importance of probabilistic studies considering the uncertainties connected with the evaluation of the material properties. Such activities become essential in studies dealing with the conservation of built cultural heritage against hazardous events, such as earthquakes. This work investigates the seismic vulnerability assessment of large monumental structures with complex geometry. The church of Santa Maria del Mar in Barcelona is considered as a case study, and a representative macro-element of the bay structure is studied against in-plane horizontal loading through pushover analysis. A Monte Carlo simulation is used to estimate the effect of the uncertainties on the material properties, which are considered as random variables. The developed fragility curves express the safety level and the damage expected on the structure for different seismic hazard scenarios. © 2019, RILEM.",Vulnerability Assessment of Monumental Masonry Structures Including Uncertainty,2019,Churches; Earthquake; Fragility curves; Monte Carlo simulation; Nonlinear static analysis; Uncertainty,None,0,0
13598,"Large magnitude earthquakes have historically caused devastating damage to engineered structures as a result of permanent ground deformations induced by soil liquefaction (e.g. 1964 Niigata earthquake, 1995 Kobe earthquake, 2010–2011 Christchurch earthquakes). A relevant amount of such damages is directly connected to liquefaction induced lateral spreading. This paper deals with the capacity of concrete framed structures with shallow foundations to handle lateral spreading demands. A simplified force–displacement compatible model was developed to capture the loads on the shallow foundations and estimate the performance of the building. The key parameters of foundation embedment, foundation width and shear length of the pillar, as well as soil friction angle were identified as having a strong influence on the expected performance. The developed model was used to develop probabilistic fragility curves for a class of buildings representing two to five storeys reinforced concrete buildings. Field measurements from existing literature of the liquefaction induced lateral displacement demand from the the September 4, 2010 (Mw 7.1) and the February 22, 2011 (Mw 6.2) Canterbury (New Zealand) earthquakes along the Avon River were probabilistically quantified in relation to the distance from the river.

13600,"Building resilient bridges, that are able to withstand multiple natural stressors with minimal damage and quickly restore their functionality is paramount to delivering climate-resilient transport infrastructure. Nevertheless, bridges are proven to be vulnerable to natural hazards, with floods and earthquakes being the main causes of failure. The available research and practice for assessing the vulnerability of river-crossing bridges is predominantly qualitative and therefore relies heavily on visual inspections, while ignoring important characteristics of the complex water-soil-bridge interaction. This is a knowledge gap that this paper aims to fill. This work provides novel fragility models for hydraulically induced stressors and/or combinations of hydraulic and seismic hazards. To achieve this, unique detailed two- and three- dimensional numerical models are employed, for a typical three-span prestressed box-girder river-crossing bridge. This paper is a primer on the vulnerability of flood-critical bridges as it models the entire water-soil-bridge system, taking into account critical hydraulic stressors (scour, debris accumulation, hydraulic forces), the uncertainty in scour hole formation, and all components of integral and isolated bridges: deck, bearings, piers and abutments, backfill, and the foundation soil. A detailed description of the damage modes for each component is given and sets of fragility curves for floods and combinations of hydraulic stressors and earthquakes are developed. The study concludes that integral bridges are in most cases more vulnerable to local scour than bridges with bearings, since the latter are more flexible and can therefore adapt to changes in their geometry. The opposite is true for global scour and/or seismic earthquake excitations. The generated fragility models are useful tools for quantitative risk assessment of transport systems and provide practical means in resilience-based asset management by owners and operators of transport infrastructure. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Vulnerability of bridges to individual and multiple hazards- floods and earthquakes,2021,Bridge; Earthquake; Failure modes; Flood; Fragility; Numerical modelling; Scour,Box girder bridges; Earthquakes; Hazards; Risk assessment; Scour; Soils; Earthquake excitation; Foundation soils; Prestressed box girders; Quantitative risk assessment; Three-dimensional numerical models; Transport infrastructure; Transport systems; Visual inspection; Floods,0,0

13602,"Fragility curves constitute the cornerstone in seismic risk evaluations and performance-based earthquake engineering. They describe the probability of a structure to experience a certain damage level for a given earthquake intensity measure, providing a relationship between seismic hazard and vulnerability. In this paper a numerical approach is applied to derive fragility curves for tunnel shafts built in clays, a component that is found in several critical infrastructure such as urban metro networks, airport facilities or water and waste water projects. The seismic response of a representative tunnel shaft is assessed using tridimensional finite difference non-linear analyses carried out with the program FLAC(3D), under increasing levels of seismic intensity. A hysteretic model is used to simulate the soil non-linear behavior during the seismic event. The effect of soil conditions and ground motion characteristics on the soil-structure system response is accounted for in the analyses. The damage is defined based on the exceedance of the concrete wall shaft capacity due to the developed seismic forces. The fragility curves are estimated in terms of peak ground acceleration at a rock or stiff soil outcrop, based on the evolution of damage with increasing earthquake intensity. The proposed fragility models allows the characterization of the seismic risk of a representative tunnel shaft typology and soil conditions considering the associated uncertainties, and partially fill the gap of data required in performing a risk analysis assessment of tunnels shafts.

13604,"The effect of the ordinance-mandated retrofit of woodframe soft-story apartment buildings in Los Angeles on the seismic resilience of a set of test-bed communities is assessed. Seismic resilience is quantified by the immediate loss of permanent housing occupancy as well as the time to recover some fraction of the pre-earthquake housing capacity. The study region comprised approximately 8000 residential buildings located in the neighborhoods of Koreatown, Westlake, Pico Union, Lomita and East Hollywood. The damage assessment was performed using HAZUS fragilities. The baseline fragilities were scaled to account for the difference in the vulnerability of the existing soft-story, existing non-soft-story and retrofitted soft-story buildings. These differences were established from the results of nonlinear response history analyses performed on structural models developed for a set of index buildings. The spatial distribution of damage was assessed using shaking intensities from the Northridge earthquake scenario and a stochastic process model was used to simulate the post-earthquake recovery. The effect of the retrofit on building damage increased with the severity of the damage, which is consistent with the primary focus on life safety performance. The ordinance retrofit reduced the immediate loss in housing for the soft-story buildings by about 20% and the time to restore 95% of the pre-event capacity was reduced by a factor of about four. © 2018 All rights reserved.",Will the los angles soft story ordinance enhance the seismic resilience of the city's residential communities?,2018,None,Apartment houses; Damage detection; Earthquake engineering; Engineering geology; Random processes; Retrofitting; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Apartment buildings; Damage assessments; Nonlinear response history analysis; Northridge earthquakes; Residential building; Residential communities; Seismic resilience; Stochastic process model; Earthquakes,0,0
13605,"Extreme winds such as tornadoes and hurricanes are relatively common natural hazards in the United States and can result in fatalities as well as damaging physical and socioeconomic infrastructure. Buildings are a critical sector within the built environment of a community and studying their performance under natural hazards is a major step for the risk and resilience assessment of a community. More than 80% of the total building stock in the United States and more than 90% of the residential buildings in North America are wood-frame construction; a construction type that is vulnerable to wind damage because they are light and typically are not engineered, only prescriptive in their design. Performance enhancement strategies for wood-frame residential buildings were investigated in this study by exploring combinations of roof coverings, roof sheathing nailing patterns, and roof-to-wall connection types. In this regard, a total of nine construction product combinations were considered. Further, recent changes to the wind standards were also explored. Specifically, the damage fragilities of five wood-frame building archetypes are considered for four damage states defined based on the performance of the building envelope, including roof coverings, doors and windows, roof sheathing, and roof-to-wall connections. The fragility curves are explained at the component level and then the building level for one archetype as an example, and the building fragility parameters are provided for all archetypes and for all construction product combinations. Comparison between fragilities developed using the last two versions of the wind standards are also presented. Then, an existing approach that amplifies the wind pressures in the wind standards to represent a tornado load is also compared. The fragility curves provided in this study can be used to represent residential buildings within a community for risk or resilience assessment/mitigation under hurricane or tornado loading. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Wind Performance Enhancement Strategies for Residential Wood-Frame Buildings,2018,Damage fragility; Hurricane; Performance assessment; Residential buildings; Risk mitigation; Tornado; Wood-frame buildings,Damage detection; Hazards; Housing; Hurricanes; Risk assessment; Roof coverings; Tornadoes; Wind effects; Wood; Wooden construction; Damage fragility; Performance assessment; Residential building; Risk mitigation; Wood frame; Walls (structural partitions),0,0
